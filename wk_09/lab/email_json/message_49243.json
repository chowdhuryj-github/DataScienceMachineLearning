But I can see your \npoint.  As for a shell buffer, I find Emacspeak to be very useful in that \nregard--as well as being a very nice bit of software in general.  It's \ndefinitely not for everybody, though.\n    I also love the console for the opertunities it provides for gaming \nunder Linux--yes, I admit it, I do that sometimes.  Nethack, Adom, and the \nother Roguelike games work horribly under Windows, but with Speakup's \nability to track the cursor and do so character by character and vertically \nas well as horizontally, they work quite well.  I have yet to see a \ngraphical (or audio, for that matter) game for Linux which will work as \nwell.\nYours,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Spie Sutherland\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Saturday, June 16, 2007 1:26 PM\nSubject: Re: My perspective on the console\n\n\n> Zach,\n>\n> What I have been thinking for some years now is that what is\n> needed is better command line based shells with less cryptic\n> commands built out the more cryptic, with some emphasis on\n> speech modality, like ability to have the whole interaction in\n> a buffer that can be navigated forwards and backwards, by\n> screens or pages at a time, or by many other configurable\n> means.
