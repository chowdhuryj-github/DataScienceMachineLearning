The only Dectalk PC driver that works is the one that comes with \nSpeakup, and even that isn't too reliable from my experience.  I no longer \nhave a computer with ISA slots, so don't know if it has gotten any better.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
