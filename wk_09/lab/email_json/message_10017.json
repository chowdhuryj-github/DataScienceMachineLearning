Specifically, look at the file  \npages/result/index.php  They have done lots of other good stuff in  \ntheir project, like filtering dangerous commands - you would not want  \nto let a user just type in any R code, because they could seriously  \ndamage your server. However, if you keep the R code on the server,  \nand just parse numeric or string inputs, you can take the simple  \napproach described above.\n\nYou will need to install GhostScript (http://www.gnu.org/software/ \nghostscript/ghostscript.html) and ImageMagick (http:// \nwww.imagemagick.org/) on your server for the image conversion\n\nFeel free to email me directly if you have problems\n\nJohn\nhttp://www.labsynch.com\n\nOn Apr 19, 2007, at 2:46 AM, d. sarthi maheshwari wrote:\n\n> Hi\n>\n> I am trying to provide web interface to my R application.
