In every single \ncircumstance, the answer was: there are grants for that. \nSince the work is done by grants, that is also a way to \nkeep prices jacked up. I have spoken with many people\nwho needs various types of assistive tech and I was quite\nshocked at the reality of the situation. One woman needed\njust some kind of special chair and it was thousands of \ndollars, it can't be done without insurance or some kind of\nbeaurocratic \"process'. And herein lies the rub, the people\nwho can make these things affordable do not on purpose.\nIt would seem to be part of the \"club\" of people who feed\neach others business interests. I even had one executive \ntype say to me \"we are not philantropists\" when proposing\nan assistive tech idea. He didn't get it, there is a market \nand the market is not \"free\" because it's artifically inflated\nby the beurocracy that believes you need \"grants\" to do \nanything. I say BS, it's time for some people to just get \nout and do things, assume they do not need a grant to \nget an idea moving. It may be slower and uphill but then\nnot relying on \"grants\" means not being in the \"game\" \nthat keeps assistive tech away from people who need it.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
