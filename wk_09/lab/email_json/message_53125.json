One of the\nthings I use with the existing Perl5 unfortunately at times, is\ncommercial software which compiles Perl code into various Microsoft\nformats: services, system tray icons, dll's and executables.  \n\nThat proved to be extremely valuable to me when I was thrown the\nresponsibility of designing implementing and maintaining an Active\nDirectory environment.  I've been writing Perl for years, and truly did\nnot want to learn to code MS's way.  I liked Perl.\n\nI think that it would be truly a valuable thing to have the ability to\ndistribute Perl as executable binaries, completely stand alone and\nindependance from the need of module installation on the client side.  \n\nEspecially with the way things are going in the market place, if we can\ntruly get cross-platform compiles that would be in the words of a tru\ncomedian, \"Dyno--mite\".\n\nPerl saves me from proprietaries *sic* on a daily basis.  Its easy for\nme to pay for a commercial product to compile Perl5 into \"executable\nmodules\" i release for system changes via Group Policies etc.  I just\nwish I didn't have to pay for that commercial product to help me love\nPerl.\n\n-I\nOn Fri, 2007-06-22 at 18:36 -0400, Chas Owens wrote:\n> On 6/22/07, chromatic  wrote:\n> > On Friday 22 June 2007 11:07:35 Chas Owens wrote:\n> >\n> > > Please, god, no.
