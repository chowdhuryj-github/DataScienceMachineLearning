I know nothing about compiling kernels or even the \ncomplexities of how all of it works, but, as I said, I just wanted to \nplay around with it. I have used speakup along with a doubletalk lt \non debian and did not have any problems throughout the install, so, \nwill it be that easy with dl? Can I just put in the cd, type the \nnormal speakup_synth=ltlk thing and get speach? If I could use \nspeakup to get it going, that would certainly be better than \nheadless, but, I did not think that you could get devil-linux with \nspeakup support. I did read that it could be headless after the \ninstall but was hoping that I could somehow have speech before that \npoint, to get it going at least. I did join the mailing list and \nasked the same question there, and have gotten several different \nanswers, from, yes, you  can have a headless installation, to, no you \ncan't, to, you can only have a headless devil-linux box after you \ninstall it. I am quite new at this and may even get myself into \nsomething I was not looking for, but, figured it was worth a try. Any \nmore help or ideas on how to get this crazy thing going would be wonderful.\nThanks for getting back.\nJeremy\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
