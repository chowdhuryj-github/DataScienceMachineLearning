Nor was I setting\nout to add a new Way To Do anything; it's just that my automatic\nexpectation for what would happen (which I'm not trying to defend as\nparticularly logical) was being violated, and P6 hasn't done that too\noften.  So I prodded to see what was going on in @larry.brain.  Your\nexplanation is all I needed to shush the little grumbles in my head.\nThanks again!\n\n-- \nMark J. Reed \n"}
