The mandatory else-part is one of the most valuable features of \nthe ternary operator. It helps ensure that variables initialized with a \ncascaded ternary actually do get initialized:\n\n      $action =  $name eq 'Kirk'  ??  'fight'\n              !! $name eq 'Spock' ??  'think'\n              !! $shirt eq 'red'  ??  'die'\n              !!                      'stand';\n\nThe required-ness of the else-part makes cascaded ternaries a safer, more \nrobust choice than if-elsif-else chains in many cases.\n\nDamian\n\n"}
