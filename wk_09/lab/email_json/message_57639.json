How do I\nsee its code?\n\nWhat I am trying to do, is to stack about 10 scatter plots on one page\nas the way \"pairs\" does.  I have about 150 variables in my table.\nInstead of plotting 150X150 pairs using \"pairs\", I only need to plot 10\npairs.\n\nThanks.\n\njiong\n The email message (and any attachments) is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential information.
