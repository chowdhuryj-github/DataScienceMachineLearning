I have a text file with 10\ndichotomous variables and a bivariate response vector.  I read this file\ninto R as a data frame, and then used the command \"randomForest(Response ~.,\ndataset, etc..\" where \"Response\" is the column header of the response\nvariable and \"dataset\" is the name of the data frame.  I get an error that\nsays \"Response\" not found.  I was looking at the Iris data example in the R\nhelp files, and it seems like this is exactly what they did.  Do you have\nany suggestions? Thanks.\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
