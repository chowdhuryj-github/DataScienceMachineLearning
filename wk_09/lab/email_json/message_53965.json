That's the file \nthat sets things up on interactive logins.  The .bashrc file is for \nnon-interactive logins.  If you want to disable scp and sftp access for \nshell users of your machine all you need do is put a command in each \naccount's .bashrc that'll generate text.  The ssh access will still be \npossible but not sftp or scp.  That was a lesson learned the hard way on \nmy part. hth.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
