You can access that either by getting the source files for \nR and unpacking them somewhere on your computer, or by browsing e.g. \nhttps://*svn*.*R*-project.org/*R*/tags/R-2-5-0 or  \nhttps://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-2-5-branch. Specifically, \nsrc/nmath/rlogis.c.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
