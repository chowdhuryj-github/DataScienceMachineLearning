There was a thread on this 4 yrs ago but none of the fixes\nwork (e.g., grid.newpage(), grid.lines(gp = gpar(col = NA)) or\npar.box=list(col=1),col=NA. These just make the data or the cube disappear.\nHas anyone solved this issue?\nHere's some sample code. In case you are wondering, I have indeed purchased\nPaul Murrel's book.\n\nlibrary(lattice)\nlibrary(grid)\n\nw <- expand.grid(X1 = seq(-29.5,-25,0.1), X3 = seq(1,90,1))\nw$z <- model(99.6,3.59,8.65,w$X1,0.5,w$X3)\n\nwireframe(z~X3*X1,w,\n scales=list(arrows=FALSE))\n\nAppreciatively,\nSeth\nDr. Seth  W.
