Any musician or composer that wants to get \nthe money collected in their name has to become a member of this \n(actually on paper 2 organizations) organization or else they'll never \nwill get this money. This rights collecting society has been granted the \nmonopoly right to collect rights by the government. Basically this \nsituation stinks and we want to see it changed:\n\nWe want to see more flexible contracts (= non-exclusive) for members of \nthe rights collecting society which allows them to choose the conditions \nunder which to release their own music and for instance use CC licenses \nfor this.\n\nSo, off course we joined his effort and thus I'm sending this email to \nthis list. Although there might not be so many dutch folks on this list, \nI would like ask the few available to go an sign the petition.\n\nFor all non-dutch people, it's a Dutch organization and it would be \nbetter for this cause to have loads of affected Dutch people sign it \ninstead of loads of non-affected non-Dutch people.\n\nInstead we would like to urge you to start your own petitions, in the \nhope that we can see a change in the contracts used by the rights \ncollecting societies all over the world and that initiatives like the CC \nlicenses can be used in conjuction with a rights collecting society \nmembership.\n\nYou can find the petition here:\n\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bumawakeup/\n\n\nPlease spread this message! Contact your Dutch friends, start your own \ninitiatives and raise awarness!\n\nSome links to the organisations mentioned:\n\n[1] http://www.rara-records.com/\n[2] http://www.lopendvuur.nl/\n[3] http://www.simuze.nl\n[4] http://www.bumastemra.nl\n\nAll the best,\n\nBjornW\nSimuze.nl\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
