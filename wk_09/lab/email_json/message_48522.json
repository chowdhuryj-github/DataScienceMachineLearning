Which java is installed you can check with java -version there\nyou see it it is properly installed and a R CMD javareconf also\nindicates if your java is configured correctly. Additionally on Fedora I\nhad to set JAVA_HOME to the JDK directory manually.\n\nStefan\n\n-------- Original Message  --------\nSubject: [R] JGR, Java and Kubuntu 7.04 ...\nFrom: John Logsdon \nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nDate: 14.06.2007 19:16\n> R-ists\n>\n> Yet again Java rears its ugly head.  \n>\n> I have Kubuntu 7.04 running the Kubuntu-repository version of R 2.4.1-1.      \n> Yes it isn't the  very latest version but this is not the issue here.  \n>\n> I want a Windows-like environment and everyone is talking about JGR.\n>\n> I downloaded it and installed it along with rJava.
