It's the recording\nindustry's favourite smoke and mirrors trick to cut hobo shaped silhouettes\nfor musicians on the assumption that if they can't afford studio time then\nthey can't afford to eat.\n\nI know a whole bunch of musicians personally who release free music in\nvarious license forms (some copyright, creative commons, even PD) who have\nno delusion that they're going to pay their mortgage from the royalties.\n\nMike's post about the Chinese situation was spot on, they're ahead of the\ngame because of the \"lost cause\" nature of the target market.  Yet artists\nthere still continue to make a good living in such a cd-hostile environment.\n\n> > It is time for the\n> > funding model to evolve.\n>\n> Experiments welcome here.\n\nI've looked into several possibilities here in the UK.  There's a number of\nprojects which gain government funding for \"charitable work\", or \"community\nwork\" which benefits others at reduced or no cost.  We have a community\nstudio locally for instance, I could record stuff there cheaply, or continue\nto do as I do now and record stuff in my own home setup.  I'm not sure if a\nband could run as a registered charity, though it's an interesting concept\n;)\n\n> > Historically, bundled into the\n> > cost of each CD or book is the cost of production and\n> > distribution.

Worth an experiment in my book.\n\nThere's a band called The Crimea who are doing something like this already,\nthey offer the CD for those folks who want something tangible (or high\nquality), but also offer their latest album for download completely free of\ncharge.\n\nhttp://www.thecrimea.net/\n\nThey're smart enough to realise it'll benefit them in the longrun, as far as\ngigs and promotion goes.  Much like the Chinese situation.\n\n> > Recording companies pay artists upfront to create\n> > something new and then charge the consumers per copy; let\n> > \u001b$B!G\u001b(Bs have fans pay the artists directly and give them the\n> > freedom to use and share.

The costs associated with writing and recording are a fraction of\nwhat they used to be, and the opportunities for the band to claw back the\ninvestment with merchandising and in the commercial space are massive.\n\n> > \u2013 The Site \u2013\n> >\n> > With actualizing this vision in mind, I created\n> > www.strayform.com.

To me the\n> works are still mostly gonna be useless and pollution.\n\nThere was another website in the news recently which looked a lot like yours\nin concept, I forget the name.  This other website was making a song and\ndance (almost literally) about their first artist making a CD from monies\npledged by myspace fans.  I say great, whatever works.  Though when they\nfinally make their recording it wasn't clear if they'd then give the\nrecording away for free or start to charge for it.\n\nI've also heard of other schemes where funders are effectively investors.\nSo the whole thing becomes like the stock market with share values for\nartists etc.\n\nI would suggest building into your plan somehow the \"beyond music\" strategy\nof the Chinese, so artists using your site don't expect to make money from\nthe fans for the music directly.  There should be something else,\nmerchandising or signed pictures or whatever.\n\nMy 2p for what it's worth :)\n\nBest of luck with the venture Brandt! :D\n\nKevin\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
