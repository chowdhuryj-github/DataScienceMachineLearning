It is different from (r.square=sum((y.hat-mean\n > (y))^2)/sum((y-mean(y))^2))\n\nYou are mixing models with intercepts with models without them.  When \nyou do this, it doesn't make sense to compare the variability about the \nmean.  The model y = constant + error is not a special case of the model \ny = slope*x + error.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
