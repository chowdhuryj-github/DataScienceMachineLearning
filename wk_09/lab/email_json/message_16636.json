I don't have the CD drive, so I'm trying to do a  \nnetwork install. The onboard ethernet and modem are handled by a  \nXircom combo card in an internal i82365 socket. The external PC card  \nsocket uses the yenta driver. Because of how the init scripts run,  \nthe yenta socket is detected and scanned, but once it's found the  \ni82365 is ignored. This means I can't get access to that onboard NIC.\n\nI've opened a shell from the installer and modprobed i82365, which  \nworks fine, but still no luck pulling up the Xircom card (it doesn't  \nshow up with lspci). If I go back to the installer after doing this  \nthe network card detection routine still doesn't find anything. Even  \nif I explicitly choose the xirc2ps module it still can't find the card.\n\nI've found some installation guides for this computer, but they all  \nrely on installing from a CD and then fiddling with how the cardbus  \nbridges are probed once the system is installed, which isn't an  \noption for me unfortunately.\n\nI think what I need to do is to manually load the i82365 bridge, and  \nthen let the system discover the xirc2ps card there and load it as  \neth0. I just don't know what commands to use to do this, and I'm  \nreally hampered because the installer busybox doesn't include vi, so  \nto change any files I have to open up the udebs and edit the files by  \nhand on another machine. I'm happy to do this if I have some idea of  \nwhich changes to make, but right now I could spend days guessing.\n\nAny suggestions here would be hugely helpful. Thanks!\n\nHugo\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble? Contact listmaster@lists.debian.org\n\n"}
