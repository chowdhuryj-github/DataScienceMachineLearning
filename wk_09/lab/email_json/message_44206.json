Just put the following line to the end of your \n/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf:\n\nInclude \"clients/speechd-up.conf\"\n\nAnd create the file /etc/speech-dispatcher/clients/spechd-up.conf as \nfollows:\n\n# Local configuration for speechd-up\nBeginClient \"*:speakup:*\"\n         DefaultPunctuationMode \"some\"\n\t#DefaultLanguage \"en\"\n\tDefaultRate 80\n\tDefaultVolume -10\n\tDefaultPitch 40\nEndClient\n\nOf course, set the values according to your preference.\n\nHope it helps\n\nTomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
