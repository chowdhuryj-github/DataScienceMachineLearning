I want to produce a cross-tabulation and use the\nprovided sampling weights to obtain representative population estimates.\n(I believe they are simply frequency weights but codebook is\nuninformative).  \n\nI can reproduce results (using this data) that were reported in a recent\njournal article, if I use SPSS or STATA--specifying the weight.  \n\nDoes anyone know how to do this in R?  I have read a lot of\ndocumentation and this is my last resort.\n\nThanks in advance,\nTom Volscho\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
