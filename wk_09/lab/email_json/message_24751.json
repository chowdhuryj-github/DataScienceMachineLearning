Medically, biotech is at the growing edge of therapeutics.\nMost older, conventional drug companies have become massive marketing\nengines with a dulled innovative edge -- only 18 new drugs were\napproved by the FDA in all of 2006. By contrast, many biotech\ncompanies retain their roots as research-based operations where the\nscientists' agenda can still compete with that of the sales\ndepartment. Some of the most exciting new treatments for cancer,\nautoimmune diseases, and even vision loss are emerging from this\ncreative new sector.\n\nBut amid the breakthrough findings, lavish entertainment, and self-\ncongratulation that will fill the convention attendees' schedules\nthis week, some important worries may not get the attention they\nmerit. The first relates to costs. Not the cost of the luxury harbor\ntours and exorbitant meals that participants will enjoy in the coming\ndays; I'm referring to what patients (or taxpayers) have to pay to\nget access to these wondrous discoveries.\n\nRegimens that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year per\npatient can cloud the moral judgment of those who purvey them. For\nexample, a confluence of interests among biotech giant Amgen, for-\nprofit dialysis centers, and kidney disease consultants seems to have\nled to substantial over prescribing of the company's flagship blood-\nbuilding product, erythropoietin -- a lucrative practice that\nprobably increases the risk of side effects and even death. Another\ndilemma: A new biotech product, Lucentis, can reverse the vision loss\ncaused by macular degeneration, a devastating cause of blindness. But\nthe drug costs $2,000 for each monthly injection. Many\nophthalmologists are convinced that equally miraculous results could\nbe provided to far more patients with use of a very similar biotech\nproduct, Avastin, at only $50 per dose. Yet Genentech, which makes\nAvastin, has not agreed to sponsor a clinical trial to study this\npossibility, which could also save Medicare hundreds of millions of\ndollars in the coming years. That's probably because Genentech makes\nboth Lucentis and Avastin, and use of the more affordable drug would\ncut into the more expensive drug's expected profits.\n\nBiotech has brought to market a number of important new cancer\ntreatments. But pricing a lifesaving cancer regimen at over $50,000\nis guaranteed to put that treatment beyond the reach of many\npatients. It doesn't cost anywhere near that much to produce these\ndrugs. Rather, the industry argues that these sky-high prices are\njustified to fuel the expensive research it performs. But many\nbiotech advances are heavily based on publicly funded research\nsupported by the National Institutes of Health and by foundations.\nCurrent policies allow companies to charge whatever they want for a\nnew drug, with no payback required for most of the indispensable,\ntaxpayer-supported basic research that made it possible. With the\nfederal deficit threatening to flatline the NIH budget for the first\ntime in a generation, and venture capital speculators increasingly\npreferring to fund safer \"late-stage\" companies with nearly\nmarketable products, savvy conventioneers this week must be worried\nabout where the next decade's miracle cures will come from -- as we\nall should be.\n\nThe breathtaking five-figure prices that some biotech drugs command\nper course of therapy warrant a rethinking of this \"trickle-down\"\napproach to supporting science -- a strategy that amounts to the\ngrowing privatization of medical research. The example of biotech's\nolder, flabbier siblings is not encouraging: Only about 14 cents of\nevery dollar paid for Big Pharma's products makes its way back into\nresearch and development, according to the companies' own figures.\n\nA safer course for the nation would be to take some of the billions\nthe nation is paying for these expensive products and use it to rev\nup NIH funding, protecting the flow of scientific innovation on which\nnew biotech products depend. The companies could then come in and do\nthe hard work needed to bring those discoveries to market. They\nshould be rewarded fairly, even handsomely for that important work --\nbut not at levels that will pauper the rest of us or the federal\ntreasury. And we need a better way to provide reasonable compensation\nfor the taxpayer-supported research on which breakthrough products\nare based. Public funding of university-based research, not\nextortionate drug prices, is the safest way to guarantee \"the miracle\ncures of tomorrow.\" It might make for fewer luxury harbor cruises at\nfuture BIO conventions, but we can live with that.\n\nDr. Jerry Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School\nand Brigham and Women's Hospital, is author of \"Powerful Medicines:\nthe Benefits, Risks, and Costs of Prescription Drugs.\"\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
