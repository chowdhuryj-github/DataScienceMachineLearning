In such case, the first created user is\ngenerally added to sudoers.\n\nHowever, SWAT insists on login in with the root account and the root account\nUnix password.\n\nWould it be possible to offer an alternative login method for users of such\nsetups?\n\nThis is Debian bug #378454\n(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=378454)\n\n\nThe same \"bug\" is reported in Ubuntu as well:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/samba/+bug/5608\n\n\n\n"}
