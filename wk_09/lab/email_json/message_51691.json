Virtual memory management is done by any modern operating\nsystem. The slowdown will be extreme.  (Therefore, a minimum\nof 2Gb is a good idea for serious crunching -- I'd recommend 3\nor 4 if possible.  Don't forget that any programming language\nmay have two copies of some arrays in memory during certain\noperations.)\n\nBut even when R itself is not using VM, any significant I/O\nload on a Windows CPU (when (S)ATA disks are used) slows down\n*at least* all other I/O, and it seems to me that it slows\ndown other interrupt servicing (e.g., responding to mouse\nclicks) as well.  Even if the latter is not strictly true, it\nmay be that the mouse click requires paging something in, like\nthe stupid animation that plays when files are copied.  \n\nAside:  On a old PC, copying files from the command line was\nfine, but if I forgot & did it from the Windows Explorer, the\nstupid animation swapped in from disk and the machine froze\nfor ~30 seconds.)\n\nWindows Vista can take advantage of a new gizmo Intel has\nintroducted with a 1 Gb solid-state disk cache. That might\nreduce such problems.\n\nMike\n\nMike Prager\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA\nBeaufort, North Carolina  USA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
