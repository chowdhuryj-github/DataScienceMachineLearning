Is there a way \nto calculate the standard error as well?\n\nThe usual SD/sqrt(n) formula probably doesn't apply here as the 10 \nobservations aren't independent.\n\nThanks,\nGad\n\n-- \nGad Abraham\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics\nThe University of Melbourne\nParkville 3010, Victoria, Australia\nemail: g.abraham@ms.unimelb.edu.au\nweb: http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~gabraham\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
