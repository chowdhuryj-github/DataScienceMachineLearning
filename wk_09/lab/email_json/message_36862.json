Each interpreter has an array containing the names of \ndirectories to search for relative file loading.  While that array's initial \ncontents come from compile-time settings, you can access and modify that \narray in PIR code.\n\nIt's ugly (which is why I'm not providing the code here), but it's doable.\n\n-- c\n\n"}
