I've also\nseen at least one S programming book (one of the yellow Springer ones)\nthat says, more briefly, the same thing.\nThe R Data Import/Export page recommends examples using SAS, Perl,\nPython, and Java. It takes a bit of courage to say that ( when you go\nto a corporate software web site, you'll never see a page saying \"This\nis the type of problem that our product is not the best at, here's\nwhat we suggest instead\" ). I'd like to provide a few more\nsuggestions, especially for volunteers who are willing to evaluate new\ncandidates.\n\nSAS is fine if you're not paying for the license out of your own\npocket. But maybe one reason you're using R is you don't have\nthousands of spare dollars.\nUsing Java for data cleaning is an exercise in sado-masochism, Java\nhas a learning curve (almost) as difficult as C++.\n\nThere are different types of data transformation, and for some data\npreparation problems an all-purpose programming language is a good\nchoice ( i.e. Perl , or maybe Python/Ruby ). Perl, for example, has\nexcellent regular expression facilities.\n\nHowever, for some types of complex demanding data preparation\nproblems, an all-purpose programming language is a poor choice. For\nexample: cleaning up and preparing clinical lab data and adverse event\ndata - you could do it in Perl, but it would take way, way too much\ntime. A specialized programming language is needed. And since data\ntransformation is quite different from data query, SQL is not the\nideal solution either.\n\nThere are only three statistical programming languages that are\nwell-known, all dating from the 1970s: SPSS, SAS, and S. SAS is more\npopular than S for data cleaning.\n\nIf you're an R user with difficult data preparation problems, frankly\nyou are out of luck, because the products I'm about to mention are\nnew, unknown, and therefore regarded as immature. And while the\nfounders of these products would be very happy if you kicked the\ntires, most people don't like to look at brand new products. Most\ninnovators and inventers don't realize this, I've learned it the hard\nway.\n\nBut if you are a volunteer who likes to help out by evaluating,\ncomparing, and reporting upon new candidates, well you could certainly\nhelp out R users and the developers of the products by kicking the\ntires of these products. And there is a huge need for such volunteers.\n\n1. DAP\nThis is an open source implementation of SAS.\nThe founder: Susan Bassein\nFind it at: directory.fsf.org/math/stats (GNU GPL)\n\n2. PSPP\nThis is an open source implementation of SPSS.\nThe relatively early version number might not give a good idea of how\nmature the\ndata transformation features are, it reflects the fact that he has\nonly started doing the statistical tests.\nThe founder: Ben Pfaff, either a grad student or professor at Stanford CS dept.\nAlso at : directory.fsf.org/math/stats (GNU GPL)\n\n3. Vilno\nThis uses a programming language similar to SPSS and SAS, but quite unlike S.\nEssentially, it's a substitute for the SAS datastep, and also\ntransposes data and calculates averages and such. (No t-tests or\nregressions in this version). I created this, during the years\n2001-2006 mainly. It's version 0.85, and has a fairly low bug rate, in\nmy opinion. The tarball includes about 100 or so test cases used for\ndebugging - for logical calculation errors, but not for extremely high\nvolumes of data.\nThe maintenance of Vilno has slowed down, because I am currently\n(desparately) looking for employment. But once I've found new\nemployment and living quarters and settled in, I will continue to\nenhance Vilno in my spare time.\nThe founder: that would be me, Robert Wilkins\nFind it at: code.google.com/p/vilno ( GNU GPL )\n( In particular, the tarball at code.google.com/p/vilno/downloads/list\n, since I have yet to figure out how to use Subversion ).\n\n\n4. Who knows?\nIt was not easy to find out about the existence of DAP and PSPP. So\nwho knows what else is out there. However, I think you'll find a lot\nmore statistics software ( regression , etc ) out there, and not so\nmuch data transformation software. Not many people work on data\npreparation software. In fact, the category is so obscure that there\nisn't one agreed term: data cleaning , data munging , data crunching ,\nor just getting the data ready for analysis.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
