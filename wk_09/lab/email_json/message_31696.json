I tried to use the exit_url parameter to call a javascript function on my page by it to\nexit_url=javascript:parent.function('foo');unfortunately, the same origin policy prevents the funtion from being executed. how can I pass the results of the \"choosing process\" to the parent frame, \ni.e. my site? I dont want the page to be refreshed, because its an ajax app...and I dont want to use\u00a0 the REST api, cause I'm too lazy ;-)thanks for your help!\n"}
