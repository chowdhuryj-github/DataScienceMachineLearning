What magical incantations am I missing from /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nor elsewhere?\n\nThe physical mouse works just fine; I've moved it onto another Debian\nsystem (a desktop system), and all its buttons and its scrollwheel\nworked just fine over there (there, xev(1) reported that scrollwheel\nforward is button 4, and scrollwheel back is button 5).\n\nThe /etc/X11/xorg.conf on my laptop has sections:\n\n    Section \"InputDevice\"\n        Identifier      \"Configured Mouse\"\n        Driver          \"mouse\"\n        Option          \"Device\"                \"/dev/input/mice\"\n        Option          \"Buttons\"               \"5\"\n        Option          \"Protocol\"              \"ImPS/2\"\n        Option          \"ZAxisMapping\"          \"4 5\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"InputDevice\"\n        Identifier      \"Synaptics Touchpad\"\n        Driver          \"synaptics\"\n        Option          \"SendCoreEvents\"        \"true\"\n        Option          \"Device\"                \"/dev/psaux\"\n        Option          \"Protocol\"              \"auto-dev\"\n        Option          \"HorizScrollDelta\"      \"0\"\n    EndSection\n\nI've also tried sections:\n\n    Section \"InputDevice\"\n        Identifier      \"Configured Mouse\"\n        Driver          \"mouse\"\n        Option          \"CorePointer\"\n        Option          \"Device\"                \"/dev/input/mice\"\n        Option          \"Protocol\"              \"ImPS/2\"\n        Option          \"Emulate3Buttons\"       \"true\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"InputDevice\"\n        Identifier      \"Synaptics Touchpad\"\n        Driver          \"synaptics\"\n        Option          \"SendCoreEvents\"        \"true\"\n        Option          \"Device\"                \"/dev/psaux\"\n        Option          \"Protocol\"              \"auto-dev\"\n        Option          \"HorizScrollDelta\"      \"0\"\n    EndSection\n\nI'm using KDE, and the applications that don't scroll in response to the\nscrollwheel are:\n\no   rxvt\no   IceWeasel\no   Emacs\n\nInterestingly, xev(1) prints events out in response to all mouse events\nexcept scrollwheel forward and scrollwheel back:\n\no   yes     mouse movement\no   yes     left mouse button down\no   yes     left mouse button up\no   yes     right mouse button down\no   yes     right mouse button up\no   yes     scrollwheel \"button\" down\no   yes     scrollwheel \"button\" up\no   no      scrollwheel forward\no   no      scrollwheel back\n\nI have only the psmouse and not the mousedev module loaded:\n\n    % lsmod | fgrep mouse\n    psmouse                35016  0 \n    %\n\nCan anyone steer me in the right direction?\n\nRegards,\nEric\n--\n\"Only the most foolish of mice would hide in a cat's ear.
