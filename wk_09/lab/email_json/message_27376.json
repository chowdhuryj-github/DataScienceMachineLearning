But so far there is a \nproblem - SAS in all its wisdom doesn't quote character string output \nwhen creating csv files with the Viewer, so you can't have commas in \nyour character strings.  There is a tab delimiter option as long as you \ndon't have tabs in the strings.  Amazing that SAS couldn't do better \nthan that.\n\nFrank\n\n> \n> \n> --- AbouEl-Makarim Aboueissa\n>  wrote:\n> \n>> Dear ALL:\n>>\n>> Could you please let me know how to read SAS data\n>> file into R.\n>>\n>> Thank you so much for your helps.\n>>\n>> Regards;\n>>\n>> Abou\n>>\n>>\n>> ==========================\n>> AbouEl-Makarim Aboueissa, Ph.D.\n>> Assistant Professor of Statistics\n>> Department of Mathematics & Statistics\n>> University of Southern Maine\n>> 96 Falmouth Street\n>> P.O.
