Using IPC is probably prefered since fork \n()ing inside a lib is icky to say the least (stray SIGHLD,  \ninteresting fd's all over the place, etc).\n\nit I was to write it it would write both ends and make a libkrbrdrep  \nthat a service lib winbind or kcm could link with to provide the  \nfunktionallity with an simple entry point (or two).\n\nLove\n\n\n"}
