Some of it is not wanting to\ndistinguish different kinds of whitespace any more than we already do.\nSome of it is simplicity of parsing, both for the human reader as\nwell as for the computer.  I think if I had to pick one reason,\nthough, it's that it allows the parser to understand the intent of\nthe writer much better and hence give more useful diagnostics when\nsomething seems to be going wrong.  Much more than other languages,\nPerl depends on the prohibition against two terms in a row as a kind\nof \"self-clocking\" mechanism to disambiguate programmer intent, and\nnot requiring a semicolon between the final term of one statement\nand the first term of the next statement would tend to weaken that,\nespecially when the term starts with a prefix operator that could be\nmistaken for an infix.\n\n: Sorry if this is already been explained but my google-fu was not good \n: enough to find an answer.\n\nHonest questions deserve honest answers, even if they aren't simple answers.\n\nLarry\n\n"}
