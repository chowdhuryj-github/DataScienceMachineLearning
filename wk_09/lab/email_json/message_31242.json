You want\nto somehow encourage MPs to look at this stuff.\n\n  As you'll note, I wrote a letter for the FLOSS MP package that the\nGOSLING group sent.\n\nhttp://www.digital-copyright.ca/edid/letter3\n\n\n  I am wondering if you have contacted the folks at Appropriation Art to\nsee what their thoughts are, given that much of this so-called \"illegal\nart\" is appropriation without permission (stuff that should be\nconsidered Fair Use, but might not be currently).\n\n\nBTW:  I hope that for a label for the DVD you will use 09-F9-...  ;-)\n\n-- \n Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n rights as owners of Information Technology.
