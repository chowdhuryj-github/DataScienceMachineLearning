It might be worth contacting upstream to\nsee about changing the license.  If the demand for changes were made\ninto a non-binding request, and the requirements for the graphic and\nlink were dropped, it would be the GPL, which would be fine.  (\"Credit\nmust be given\" seems to be covered by clause 2c.)\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
