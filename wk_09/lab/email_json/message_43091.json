This file should contain high level information about each\nrelease which the user and testers would find useful.  In other words it\ndoesn't need to be as detailed as a ChangeLog and only needs to include\nmajor changes and bug fixes.\n\nExample:\n\n3 - 6/5/2007\n==\n* unclogged the tubes by pulling the big trucks out\n\n2 - 6/4/2007\n==\n\n* fixed flickering issue\n* added new freak-out mode button\n* activity is now mesh aware\n  - can be shared on the mesh\n  - uses tubes for sending big trucks over\n\n1 - 6/2/2007\n==\n\n* initial release\n\nFor RPM ChangeLogs please write similar notes.  This is not helpful:\n\n%changelog\n* Tue Jan 5 2007  John (J5) Palmieri  - 0.1-1\n- updated to upstream version 0.1\n\nThank you\n\n-- \nJohn (J5) Palmieri \n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
