There was no mention of windows, thus I don't see how the\nreference to jaws fits in, unless it was to explain how jaws gets its\ndata, which is besides the point.\n\nAlso, the reference to usb being the better choice was\ninappropriate, since speakup currently doesn't support usb synths, as has\nbeen mentioned here frequently, especially in recent threads. Having\nsaid that, if you're going to rely on speakup, you will want to be\nsure that all the work stations you're going to use have at least 1\nrs232 serial port. If they don't, then you're in trouble if you\nexpect to use speakup.\n\nAlso, be aware that suse doesn't include speakup in their\ndistribution, and I'm not aware of any existing suse kernels with\nspeakup patched into them. You mentioned also not being sure about the\naccessibility of slackware. Actually, slackware was the first\ndistribution to include a speakup-patched kernel in the official\nslackware media.\n\nAs for which synth to choose, I think the 2 biggest factors in that\ndecision are the speech, and the price of each. The doubletalk lt is\ncheaper than the dectalk usb, which does also have a serial port as\nfar as I know. As for the speech, I personally prefer that of the\ndoubletalk, but that's probably because I've used a doubletalk far\nmore than I have used a dectalk, and others may disagree here as\nwell. Speech is a very qualitative subject, and there is no synth that\nfits every person's taste perfectly. As an aside, you wouldn't have\nbeen able to use a doubletalk pc anyway, because they aren't being produced\nanymore, and because it is very hard these days to find a pc with an\nisa slot.
