E.g., I didn't have to ask formal permission \nto use data from Altman's book in mine (and I did check with my \npublisher). I suspect that things can get murkier than that though; I \nseem to recall stories of plagiarism cases in relation to collections of \nmathematical tables. Beware also that there can be other legal \ncomplications, including rights to first publication of new results, \nwhich usually implies that you cannot publish entire datasets until \ntheir publication potential has been exhausted. And of course, proper \nattribution is required for reasons of scientific integrity and general \ncourtesy.
