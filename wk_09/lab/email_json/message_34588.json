Granted a million dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be but I\u2019m still betting you\u2019d willingly oblige!\nIf only all decisions came that easily, right?\nFor us investors, the decision to sell is the most difficult. Not a snap decision to be sure. So how do you decide when to sell?\nA) A few shakes of the magic 8 ball \nB) Eeny Meeny Miny Mo\nC) Rock, paper, scissors\nGeez, I hope your answer is none of the above!\nThe only indicator that gives you the \u201call clear\u201d is when you determine that the risk outweighs the reward.\nLet me illustrate.\nAs many of you know, I issued a series of sell alerts from April 25 to April 27 for all of the stocks that were then in the Trending123 portfolio. But the consensus in the markets was that there were more profits to be made. So who was right?\n\nTake a look at some of the stocks that we sold:\n\n\nTicker\nSold on\nReturn\nSince Sale\nReturn if Held\n\n\nGSS\n4/27/07\n37.15%\n-15.48%\n21.67%\n\n\nTGEN\n4/26/07\n29.13%\n-43.70%\n-14.57%\n\n\nALAN\n4/26/07\n27.05%\n-29.10%\n-2.05%\n\n\nONSM\n4/26/07\n11.20%\n-20.33%\n-9.13%\n\n\nID\n4/25/07\n14.91%\n1.45%\n16.36%\n\n\nOMG\n4/25/07\n9.13%\n5.95%\n15.08%\n\n\nANDE\n4/25/07\n28.24%\n-16.79%\n11.45%\n\n\nAs you can see, some of our gains would have been reduced, as with GSS. But others would have been turned into losses, e.g., TGEN and ALAN\u2014and everyone knows that\u2019s not smart trading.\nOf course, I\u2019d be remiss not to point out the stocks that continued to rise, like ID and OMG. But are the extra couple of points of return worth the risk? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, the average decline if we kept all of them would be -6.68%.\nThe bottom line is that even though a handful of the Trending123 portfolio stocks went higher, the majority of stocks we closed out dropped as much as 60-70% from the day the sell alert was issued!\nIf you aren\u2019t a Trending123 subscriber yet, then you missed my entire update including the full list of portfolio stocks that we closed out in late April.
