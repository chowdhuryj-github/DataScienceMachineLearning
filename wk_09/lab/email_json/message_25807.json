According to \n      authorities, the six men planned to \u201ckill as many soldiers as possible\u201d at \n      Fort Dix Army Base in Northern New Jersey. Correspondent Bob Orr \n      will have the main story and our investigative correspondent Armen \n      Keteyian will look at previous alleged terror plots that have been \n      uncovered by authorities here at home. Also at the top of the \n      broadcast, rivers are rising in the Midwest. They are swelling to the \n      brink in Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma today, raising fears that local \n      flooding there will grow more widespread. Cynthia Bowers will \n      survey the situation while Nancy Cordes will explain exactly how the \n      Midwest\u2019s geography makes it so susceptible to flooding. Much of \n      the water accumulation now threatening the center of the country is due to \n      the storm system that spawned the tornadoes that leveled Greensburg, \n      Kansas. Hari Sreenivasan is in Greensburg tracking the recovery \n      effort. In North Carolina, doctors are refusing to participate in \n      death-row executions saying that by doing so they violate the physician\u2019s \n      oath. Doctors say it is their right and duty not to participate in \n      executions. But some prosecutors say that\u2019s just not the case and that \n      doctors shouldn\u2019t be able to overrule the justice system. Randall \n      Pinkston will cover the debate. Some of the smallest victims \n      of the war in Iraq go largely unnoticed, though there are thousands of \n      them. The orphans of Iraq often live on the city\u2019s violent streets if they \n      cannot find a place in one of the eight cramped orphanages. Our Mark \n      Strassmann will introduce you to some Iraqi kids who navigate daily \n      danger alone. Finally, headgear with pizzazz has become a \n      signature of Great Britain\u2019s royal family.
