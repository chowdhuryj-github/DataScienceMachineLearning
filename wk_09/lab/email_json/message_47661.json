We \neventually got YASR running through speech-dispatcher and the new IBM TTS. \nLast week some1 mentioned we needed an emacs server for YASR?  Well, can you \nplease tell us how-and-where?  Main drawback is that when speech-dispathcer is \nrunning, I cannot use my sound-card for anything else.  We could not find any \ncommands to start TTS, so Mike used telnet to controll it.  I really like the \nsound of this eliquence clone--and some day I may want to even run speakup \noccasionally through it, as I am still having some issues with Dec-Talk. \nThanks in advance--and I will send along helpful comments to Mike\nHart\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
