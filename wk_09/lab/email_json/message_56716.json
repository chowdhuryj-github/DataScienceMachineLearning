{"category": "ham", "to_address": "debian-desktop@lists.debian.org", "from_address": "\"Gustavo Franco\" <stratus@debian.org>", "subject": "Debian Desktop Etch+1 - the long road to binoculars.", "body": "Hi list,\n\nI would like to show you some of my plans for our next Debian Desktop\nrelease, some stuff that others people are doing and ask for some\nsuggestions, help and feedback in general. Before that, some history\nfor those jumping late on the bandwagon.\n\nDebian Desktop Sarge\n---------------------------\nWe had /devel/debian-desktop website, the mailing list and two desktop\ntasks (kde, gnome) to be used into d-i and on a running system. It\nwasn't possible install kde desktop task without explicit preseeding\nthough. There was no common artwork.\n\n\nDebian Desktop Sarge+1 development process\n----------------------------------------------------------\nThere was an alioth two-person group, lots of wiki articles and the\nsame /devel/debian-desktop, three more desktop environment groups\n(pkg-kde, pkg-gnome and pkg-xfce) and no common (art)work between\nthem.\n\n\nDebian Desktop Etch\n-------------------------\nWe have common artwork on the alioth group cited above,\n/devel/debian-desktop was updated, a lot of wiki articles reviewed. We\nreleased with GNOME as default (as in sarge), but with two alternative\nimages to install the other 2 desktop environments involved (KDE and\nXfce). There's also multimedia support on the browser for GNOME (totem\nusing xine as backend). A lot of time was invested to make Debian\nDesktop Etch the best as possible and working out of the box with 100%\nfree software.\n\nWell, a lot of people don't realize that yet, even some of the most\nactive Debian contributors. The first thing I ask you is to spread the\nword that Debian Etch is a big jump in terms of usability out the box\nand everything else. I'm of course biased, but that's also the\nfeedback we're receiving from the press.\n\nI was really amazed watching tons of people using Debian on their\nlaptops during debconf 7 with the *default artwork*. There's an\ninteresting side effect here for us that I'll outline below.\n\n\nDebian Desktop Etch+1\n----------------------------\n* Common artwork\n\nIt was just to test the waters, I thought it would be easier keep the\ndiscussion around desktop-base source package and did my best to put\npeople from pkg-kde, pkg-gnome and pkg-xfce cooperating. I remember\nthe online meeting when people started diverting the discussion, I'm\nglad we managed to put things back on track.\n\nWith Debian Desktop Etch+1, I would like to see the common artwork\nextended to g-i (as outlined by Frans Pop in another thread) and\nsplash screen (details below). I would prefer just a minor update in\nterms of login screens and wallpapers, keep the Etch stuff is a must\nhave as it's document how the Lenny user will be able to revert to\nprevious artwork.\n\n* Splash screen\n\nI've been working behind the scenes since Etch development cycle to\nenable a splash screen solution (usplash or splashy) by default just\nfor Debian Desktop! It would be possible preseeding grub configuration\nand it wasn't done due to the splash screen solutions status on Etch\nand lack of preseeding support for grub. There's also the grub2 issue.\nThe idea is release with grub2. In other words if you want to help\nwith this goal, please give some love to: grub2, usplash and splashy.\n\n* Tasks\n\nIt's being harder than I though add/edit/remove stuff from the tasks\nas it was during Etch development cycle. Anyway, we need to review the\nlist of packages and more than that work to make sure that these\npackages and its dependencies are in good shape into testing.\n\nIf you would like to help with this, start running `tasksel\n--task-packages gnome-desktop` - also desktop, kde-desktop and\nxfce-desktop. I would be more happy with removals of packages and\nproof that the feature can be achieved using something else.\n\nWe used to have http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?task=\nwhere I keep an eye on the tasks health in terms of version and bugs.\nI'll ask the ddpo guys what's going on with that.\n\nI'm sure that kde and xfce desktop tasks needs more love than\ngnome-desktop and desktop, simple because I'm using more the later\ntwo. I heard Corsac while writing the xfce desktop content, but I'm\nsure it will be outdated during Lenny development cycle.\n\n* Flash and Java support\n\nIt would be amazing if we could add stable enough: gnash or swfdec\n(flash) and basically gcjwebplugin (java) or maybe something that will\ncome out from openjdk.\n\nI've already seen people watching movie trailers from Apple website\n(as I do) using Debian Desktop Etch without considering what was under\nthe hood to make that possible. We picked totem mozilla (gecko) based\nbrowsers plugin with xine backend (packages: totem-mozilla and\ntotem-xine). Avoid gstreamer usage was intentional. I would be glad to\nreview such a decision, but with proof that we can support more\nformats out of the box (about:plugins is your friend).\n\nAny help testing, reporting bugs and sending patches to the upstream\nin the projects cited above is appreciated. Tell us here about your\nprogress.\n\n* Upgrade manager (update-manager)\n\nI've discussed with kov some of the stuff that can be done to make\nsure Debian Desktop Etch upgrades to Lenny will be easier than\nSarge->Etch.\n\n* Installable Live CDs\n\nThe title says it all. Daniel (panthera), Otavio Salvador and maybe\nothers worked on this  during debconf7. First we will have installable\nlive cds 'as is' and hopefully sooner than later live cds able to call\nthe installer letting you install anything you want (eg: a dns server\nfrom gnome using g-i).\n\n\nOnline meeting\n------------------\n\nI need to sort out some IRL issues but after that I'll make a call for\na new online meeting. I hope to see you all there.\n\nThank you very much for those who helped Debian Etch be a universal\ndesktop! ;) Oh, stop by http://get.debian.net/ . More to come soon.\n\nregards,\n-- stratus\nhttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com\nget debian @ http://get.debian.net/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
