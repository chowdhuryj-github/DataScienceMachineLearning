Those modifications would not change the license\nterms under which the package was received.\n\nThe discussion is regarding the distribution, in Debian, of works --\nthe license texts -- under terms that do not meet the DFSG. The\nguidelines don't require that license *terms* be mutable by the\nrecipient, but they do require that the *work* be modifiable and\nre-distributable by the Debian project and any recipients of Debian.\n\n-- \n \\             \"To label any subject unsuitable for comedy is to admit |\n  `\\                                        defeat.\"  -- Peter Sellers |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
