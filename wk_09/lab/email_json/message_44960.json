FDA is required to accepted all \nsubmissions, and they get some where only Excel was used, or Minitab, \nand lots more.  There is a session on this at the upcoming R \nInternational Users Meeting in Iowa in August.  The session will include \ndicussions of federal regulation compliance for R, for those users who \nfeel that such compliance is actually needed.\n\nFrank\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
