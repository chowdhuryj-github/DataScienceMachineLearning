I don't have an Express or\nany other DECTalk for that matter so I can't test it myself so if what\nwe now have isn't right then it will take somebody else to hunt down\nwhat isn't working exactly.  I will look at the code again in the next\nfew days but all I can do is guess at this point.\n\n  Kirk\n\n-- \n\nKirk Reiser\t\t\t\tThe Computer Braille Facility\ne-mail: kirk@braille.uwo.ca\t\tUniversity of Western Ontario\nphone: (519) 661-3061\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
