You should make you're using the synaptics driver\nwhich will give you many configuration parameters, including sensitivity,\ntwo-finger-scolling, tapping, ...\n\nIn my case tpconfig doesn't seem to have any impact (although it does give\nthe impression of working correctly), whereas things like synclient or\n[gq]synaptics definitely do work.\n\nI haven't yet found a good way to completely disable the touchpad (not just\nthe tapping) while typing.  If someone knows of such a thing, I'd love to\nhear about it.\n\n\n        Stefan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
