(Perhaps the two could be \ncombined at some point.)\n\nI am thinking make your music available as an ardour project file. Complete \nmulti-track.\n\nNow, I have not experimented enough to know if all the pieces are there yet, \nbut what I see is the raw tracks with an official mastering control file \nthrought jamin to a final mix, and the stereo mixdown that comes from that.\n\nThen let the fan go hog wild for themselves. Drop a backing vocal and record \ntheir own and do another mix down. Then their CD that they end up burning \nwill really be personalized. Same if they play an instrument.\n\nI was wondering yesterday if you could take one of the Live Audio \nDistributions and stick and ardour project on it and make it boot to a \nplaying project... I may try this soon if I can find the time.\n>\n> Kev\n>\n\nall the best,\n\ndrew\n\n-- \n(da idea man)\nWorking on a Movie Script or two in June 2007\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
