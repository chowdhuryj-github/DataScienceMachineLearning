Besides the fact that energy theft is a crime, it also creates an undue burden for ratepayers, to whom the cost associated directly with stolen energy and associated revenue protection programs is often passed. Nationally, it is estimated that as much as $6 billion per year is lost by utilities through theft.\n\u00a0\nThis two day EUCI Energy Theft course will offer comprehensive, yet palatable information and techniques on recognizing, investigating and recovering these types of losses in electrical systems. This course will consist of several hands-on meter exercises and direct experience case studies. \n\u00a0\n\nAttendees will learn how to:\n\n\nRecognize the types of non-technical losses\n\nDetermine signs of theft\n\nEstablish a program\n\nConduct an investigation\n\nGather control evidence\n\nCalculate and collect lost revenue\n\nDocument and write energy theft reports\n\nProvide testimony in litigation and regulatory hearings\n\n\u00a0\nWho Should Attend  \n\u00a0\n\nComptrollers\n\nRevenue Recovery Investigators & Supervisors\n\nMeter Test & Meter Reading Employees and Supervisors\n\nCustomer Service Supervisors\n\nAny utility employee whose responsibilities include litigation of lost revenue cases and protecting company revenues\n\nRegulators\n\nCost of Service and Rate Design Staff\n\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n  Click\n                        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n  Renewable \n                            Power Project Finance: The Tutorial\nApril 30 - May 2, 2007\n                            New York, NY \n  A Water \n                            Constrained Future - How Producers Can Minimize Impacts in the West\nSan Diego, CA\n                              May 1-2, 2007 \n   GasFair-PowerFair 2007\nToronto, Ont\n                            May 1-2, 2007 \n  Recognizing and \n                            Recovering Energy Theft\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Cost-Effective \n                            Transmission Technology\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Western \n                            Renewable Power Development Summit\nSan Francisco, CA\n                              May 7-9, 2007 \n   Solar Power Project Finance & Investment Summit\nSan Diego, CA\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  Gas Mart \n                            2007\nChicago, IL\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  In-Depth \n                            introduction to the Natural Gas Industry\nDallas, TX\n                              May 15-16, 2007 \n  Natural Gas \n                            Transactions, Trading and Origination for Non-Traders\nDallas, TX\n                              May 16-17, 2007 \n  Developing and \n                            Launching New Products and Services for Utilities\nDallas, TX\n                              May 17-18, 2007 \n  Performance \n                            Benchmarking For Energy Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007 \n  Pandemic \n                            Preparedness For Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007  \u00a0 \n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
