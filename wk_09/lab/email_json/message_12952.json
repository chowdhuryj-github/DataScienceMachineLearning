If you're referring to the\nGPL-specific exception for source code (that components of the target\nsystem don't need to be distributed with source), that doesn't seem to\nbe relevant at all: this is about the license terms for a text, not\nwhether source code must be distributed.\n\n> Yes, you can't do without it, but you also can't start obsessing on\n> it because the matter can soon get absurd after that.

This behaviour doesn't match the Social Contract.\n\n> Lawyers would likely ask us - what would be the legal purpose of\n> addressing this concern?\n\nWhy would lawyers ask us that, and why are their questions about the\nSocial Contract germane here? It's not a legally-binding document.\n\n> Trying to \"clarify\" the social contract by elaborating on peripheral\n> things that aren't immediately obvious, is basically nitpicking, and\n> it shouldn't be done.\n\nI would think thazt *only* things which are immediately obvious are\nexempt from the need for clarification. Anything else needs to at\nleast be considered on its merits, and not dismissed because it's \"not\nimmediately obvious\".\n\n> Also, nobody cares for statements that can be normalized to 'you can\n> do all this, except that, that, that, and that', and those should\n> also be avoided if we want readers to take the spirit of the\n> document seriously.\n\nI don't see how that's at all true. Contrariwise, I would hope you\nagree that a document that says \"we will always do this, and never do\nthat\", but which is routinely violated in practice, is one that\nreaders will not take seriously.\n\n-- \n \\      \"Why should I care about posterity?
