If you load this before each lecture/demonstration and use HTMLStart, HTMLplot, and HTMLStop you will end up with a nice html transcript of the entire session (commands and output) that you could place under a course website for the students to refer back to (rather than them having to write down every command you type/paste in).\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch on behalf of Giovanni Petris\nSent: Fri 4/20/2007 5:29 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Suggestions for statistical computing course\n\n\n\n\nThanks to everybody who responded to my query. I got many useful\nsuggestions about books and editors, plus notes and other material\nonline.\n\nSummarizing, the books suggested were\n\n- Monahan, Numerical Methods of Statistics\n- Lange, Numerical analysis for statisticians\n\nIn terms of Editors, TINN-R was mentioned several times, in addition\nto R's build-in code editor.\n\nI will report to the list on my experience in this course and whatever\nbooks/tools I will end up using, since there seems to be some\ninterest.\n\nHave a good weekend!\nGiovanni\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
