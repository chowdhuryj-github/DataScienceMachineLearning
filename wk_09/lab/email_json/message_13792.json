A report in today\u2019s Washington Post revealed that the FDA\n  has known for years about contamination problems at the facilities that\n  produced these products. Nancy Cordes will have the full story, and\n  we\u2019ll also take a look at whether the FDA has the financial ability to\n  fix the problem.\n\u00a0\nClasses resumed today at Virginia Tech one week\n  after the shooting rampage that left 32 students dead. Sharyn Alfonsi has our\n  report from Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\u00a0\nJim Axelrod will bring you the latest on Attorney\n  General Alberto Gonzales, who has just received another vote of confidence\n  from President Bush. Gonzales has promised to stay in his post as long as he\n  can \u201ccontinue to serve effectively.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\nPolitics has become a popular pastime in France.\n  At least 84 percent of the country\u2019s voters cast ballots in the first\n  round of presidential elections. Now, it is down to two candidates with very\n  different visions for the country\u2019s future, Sheila MacVicar will\n  report.\n\u00a0\nBoris Yeltsin, the man who engineered the final\n  collapse of the Soviet Union and brought a market economy to Russia,\n  died this morning. Elizabeth Palmer will report on Yeltsin\u2019s effect on\n  democracy in Russia.\n  She\u2019ll also give you a peek into some of the lesser-known events of the\n  former president\u2019s life.\n\u00a0\nBack in the United States, a judge exonerated\n  a man \u2013 after he had served 25 years in prison. Jerry Miller had been\n  found guilty of rape, robbery, aggravated kidnapping and battery in 1981.\n  Today he became the 200th prisoner exonerated due to DNA evidence,\n  according to a group that works to free wrongly-convicted inmates. Byron\n  Pitts will have the story.\n\u00a0\nThe soundtrack of the young generation is hip-hop\n  music \u2013 and its biggest consumers are young white males. It is an\n  industry where sex and violence sell \u2013 but not everyone\u2019s happy\n  about that. Bill Whitaker will examine the debate over vulgar, violent\n  lyrics. \n\u00a0\nRemember those funky, flimsy 3D glasses from decades\n  ago? NASA is bringing them back. It has compiled images of the sun from two\n  orbiters and laid them on top of each other for a three-dimensional effect.\n  Jerry Bowen will give you a look.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
