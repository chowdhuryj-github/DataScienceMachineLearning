Package 'ltm' covers a variety of such models.\n\nBut to begin to give advice we would need to know the scientific problem \nfor which Ranga Chandra Gudivada is looking for a tool. Simon Blomberg \nmentioned ordination, but that is only one of several classes of uses of \nPCA (which finds a linear subspace that both has maximal variance within \nand is least-squares fitting to the data).\n\n>\n>      Hope this helps.\n>      Spencer Graves\n>\n> Josh Gilbert wrote:\n>> I don't understand, what's wrong with using prcomp in this situation?\n>>\n>> On Sunday 10 June 2007 12:50 pm, Ranga Chandra Gudivada wrote:\n>>\n>>> Hi,\n>>>\n>>>     I was wondering whether there is any package implementing Principal\n>>> Component Analysis for Binary data\n>>>\n>>>                                               Thanks chandra\n>>>\n>>>\n>>> ---------------------------------\n>>>\n>>>\n>>> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>>>\n>>> ______________________________________________\n>>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>>> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n>>> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal,\n>>> self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>>\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n-- \nBrian D.
