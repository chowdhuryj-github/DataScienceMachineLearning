Congressional Resolution Honors the Monuments Men\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <465523B6.9000402@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Members of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section (?MFAA?), commonly referred to as the ?Monuments Men,? were recognized for their heroic and valiant efforts ?to locate, identify, catalogue, restore, and repatriate priceless works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts? during and after World War II, with the passing of Congressional Resolution H. Con. Res. 48 on Thursday, May 17, 2007. The Resolution was inspired by Robert M. Edsel, whose exhaustively researched book, Rescuing Da Vinci, reveals and recounts the exploits of these unsung heroes.\n\nThe Congressional Resolution was included as an amendment to the Armed Services Committee?s National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (HR 1585) by Congressman Robin Hayes (R-Concord), which was passed by the House by a vote of 397 ? 27. Congresswoman Kay Granger (R-Fort Worth), along with Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY) and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) were the original co-sponsors of H. Con. Res. 48. The efforts of ?the Monuments Men were significant and they deserved to be honored for it,? said Ms. Granger, who spearheaded the development and passage of H. Con. Res. 48 after meeting with Mr. Edsel and learning of the incredible role these men and women played in preserving these cultural treasures throughout World War II and the years that followed.\n\nMr. Edsel and Sgt. Harry Ettlinger, one of the 12 known surviving Monuments Men, joined Rep. Granger and Rep. Frelinghuysen for the introduction of the Resolution late last year. A similar Resolution will be introduced in the Senate next month by Sen. Inhofe (R-OK), Sen. Kennedy (D-MA), Sen. Hutchinson (R-TX) and Sen. Boxer (D-CA). A ceremony is being planned to honor the Monuments Men in Washington, DC on June 6, 2007, to coincide with the 63rd Anniversary of the ?D-Day? landings in Normandy.\n\nOn the occasion of the bill?s passage, Mr. Edsel said: ?From the outset, my goals in writing Rescuing Da Vinci were to raise public awareness for the Monuments Men and to help these unsung heroes achieve the recognition they so justly deserve for their unprecedented contribution in rescuing so many of the world?s most valued art treasures from the Nazis. It is important for us as a society to learn from the rich legacy of the Monuments Men and women about how to protect and safeguard civilization?s most important works of art and cultural treasures. Words cannot adequately express my gratitude to Ms. Granger, Ms. Slaughter and Mr. Frelinghuysen for all of their efforts and support in recognizing the Monuments Men and their extraordinary contribution to mankind.?\n\nSgt. Ettlinger, who supervised the recovery of stolen art from the German salt mines in Heilbronn-Kochendorf, stated, ?On behalf of the Monuments Men, I am grateful that Congress has acknowledged the importance of preserving art and culture. While we do not consider ourselves to be heroes because we did the job given to us, I would like to thank Rep. Granger and her colleagues for recognizing our contribution.?\n\nS. Lane Faison, III, son of recently deceased Monuments Man S. Lane Faison, Jr., had the following to say: ?This is a great day for art and for all those who endeavored to preserve it from the ravages of war. While recognition has come too late for most of them, may the remaining few and all their families savor the day long overdue but never too late. For all of those in some way connected to the Monuments Men, we owe special thanks to Robert Edsel and all of his associates who made this day possible.?\n\nSaid Lynn Nicholas, author of The Rape of Europa, which recounts the systematic theft, deliberate destruction and miraculous survival of Europe?s art treasures during World War II, ?It?s wonderful that Congress has recognized the achievements of these unsung heroes who were so modest about their own accomplishments but who, in fact, saved the entire patrimony of Europe for posterity.,? A documentary film based on The Rape of Europa, and co-produced by Mr. Edsel, opened in theaters in San Francisco Friday, with a wide release expected later this summer.\n\nAbout Robert M. Edsel\n\nMr. Edsel, who was formerly a nationally ranked tennis player, as well as a successful business entrepreneur in the oil and gas industry, sold his company and moved to Europe with his family in 1996. While in Florence, he developed a great passion for art and architecture and became curious as to how all the monuments and great works of art survived the devastation of World War II. What began as a question evolved into an impassioned journey to unravel the secrets and heroics of the unsung heroes who saved the world?s greatest art and cultural treasures for the benefit of humanity. In addition to his book, Rescuing Da Vinci, and the documentary, The Rape of Europa, Mr. Edsel is establishing a not-for-profit foundation with objectives that include promoting educational programs about the history of the Monuments Men and facilitating the recovery and return of stolen works of art. This initiative has as its objective immortal recognition of the Monuments Men and their incred\nible contribution to world culture. Mr. Edsel is a native of Dallas, Texas and is highly sought after for lectures and personal appearances. Rescuing Da Vinci is available at www.amazon.com, www.bn.com, and bookstores nationwide.\n\nAbout The Monuments Men\n\nThe Monuments Men, a special multinational group of more than 350 men and women, served on frontline military units, to ensure the preservation, protection, liberation and restitution of the world?s greatest artistic and cultural treasures. This ?band of unsung heroes,? worked tirelessly to track down, identify and catalogue millions of priceless works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts, including masterpieces by Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer, that had been stolen by Hitler and the Nazis. The detailed documentation, inventories and photographs developed and catalogued by the Monuments Men during and following World War II, have made, and continue to make possible the restitution of stolen artworks to rightful owners and their descendents. After WWII, many Monuments Men went on to become renowned directors and curators of preeminent international cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Mu\nseum of Modern Art, as well as professors at esteemed universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, New York University and Williams College. Others became founders, presidents, and members of associations such as the New York City Ballet, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nContacts\n\nhttp://home.businesswire.com\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 5\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:35:23 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] us. Handyman Gets Probation For Stealing Painting\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4655241B.2020408@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nHandyman Gets Probation For Stealing Painting\n\nPOSTED: 4:14 pm EDT May 22, 2007\n\nWATERFORD, Conn. -- A handyman was sentenced to a special form of probation Tuesday in the theft of a $1 million painting that sent Waterford police on a European odyssey to retrieve it. Charges against Charles R. McSpieal Jr., 45, of Niantic will be dismissed if he completes two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. McSpieal has no criminal record and the painting's owner, Nelson White of Waterford, approved the arrangement.\nMcSpieal was charged last year with first-degree larceny. Police called it the largest investigation of its kind in the history of the department, one that included help from the FBI, an international stolen arts registry and authorities in the Netherlands.\nThe small painting of chrysanthemums, an Henri Fatin-Latour original from the 1800s called \"Bouquet D'Hiver,\" was taken from White's shed, where McSpieal had been doing electrical work.\nAn Old Saybrook antiques dealer said McSpieal was selling the painting and other items out of his trunk last year. She bought the lot for $100. Her lawyer said she had no idea the painting was so valuable. After she hung it in her shop, a savvy customer spotted it and suggested she have appraised. The appraisal came back at $150,000 and the painting was eventually sold to a buyer in the Netherlands for $1 million. A Waterford detective brought it back last year.\nPolice said McSpieal likely didn't know how valuable the painting was either. He told authorities he took it so he could make a little cash. \"I am sorry for any pain and inconvenience I may have brought to Mr. White and this court,\" McSpieal said in court.\nJudge Susan B. Handy said she was pleased McSpieal would pay restitution to the antiques dealer and to the town of Waterford for the costs of retrieving the painting. Had it not turned out to be worth so much money, the case would not have drawn so much attention, she said. \"I clearly think he was just trying to turn a quick buck,\" she said.\n\nhttp://www.nbc30.com\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 6\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:36:04 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] German police hope stolen Cypriot artifacts will be\n\treturned\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <46552444.10007@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nGerman police hope stolen Cypriot artifacts will be returned\n22/05/2007\n\nA German investigator, dealing with a case of stolen cultural heritage artifacts from Cyprus? Turkish occupied areas, hopes that these will be returned to their lawful owners.\nAddressing an event on the destruction of Cyprus? cultural heritage, as a result of the continuing Turkish occupation of the island?s northern part, Walter Moser, investigator with the Bavarian police force, said the case of stolen religious artifacts is before the courts in Munich and the Federal judicial authorities.\nHe said they will decide if and when the stolen property will be returned to Cyprus.\nThe case pending before the courts involves Turkish born art dealer Aydin Dikmen, facing charges of illegal export, possession and attempts to sell property belonging to the church of Cyprus.\nMoser expressed hope that the case will soon conclude and that the objects will be returned to Cyprus.\nSpeaking at the same event, professor Klaus Gallas said that the largest number of stolen mainly religious treasures are in Munich and the German authorities have yet to return them to Cyprus, in spite of the fact that their origin has been established.\nAccording to the church of Cyprus, some 500 churches have been either destroyed or pillaged since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Some religious relics have been bought back, others were returned to the church after lengthy legal proceedings and others are still at large.\n\nhttp://www.financialmirror.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 7\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:37:28 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] us.

A burglary has left police looking into how thieves walked away with about $750,000 worth of paintings from a local artist's home and wondering how the perpetrators plan to get rid of the easily identifiable loot.\n\nIn the unusual burglary, police say at least one burglar stole two bicycles and about 250 framed oil paintings by local artist John Cosby, a plein-air painter whose work has been featured in galleries in Laguna Beach and across the nation.\n\n\"It was like a decorator robbed my house,\" he said.\n\nOnly three of Cosby's paintings, which were unframed, were left behind.\n\n\"Either they were incredibly picky, or everyone is an art critic now,\" he said. \"It almost made me insecure of the painting.\"\n\nCosby was away in South Carolina between April 23 and 29, when police believe the burglary occurred. He had just moved in to his new home in March and a side door to the two-car garage where the paintings were being temporarily stored was left unsecured.\n\nArt thefts are not a rare occurrence in Laguna Beach, said Detective Debbie Kelso. The city has an active artistic community and several art galleries line city streets, but a theft of this magnitude is unheard of, she said.\n\nPolice have contacted other police agencies and art galleries to be on the lookout.\n\nThe paintings should be easily identifiable, Kelso said. Each one was signed by Cosby twice and contained a serial number.\n\nContact the writer: shernandez@ocregister.com or 949-454-7361\n\nhttp://www.ocregister.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 8\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:38:13 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Picasso drawing called fake,\tbut lawsuit against Duluth\n\tdealer real\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <465524C5.7050405@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nPicasso drawing called fake, but lawsuit against Duluth dealer real\n\nBy KEVIN DUFFY\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nPublished on: 05/22/07\n\nThe simple black-and-white drawing shows two unclothed figures, one reclining, the other sitting. It looks like something Pablo Picasso might have completed in a few minutes.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, \"Personage Endormi et Femme Accroupie\" [Sleeping Person and Squatting Woman] fetched $145,000 when it sold to a London gallery.\n\nDuluth art dealer Charles Locke helped broker the deal without meeting the seller, the buyer or the other middlemen. Or seeing the actual drawing.\n\nMoney changed hands based only on an e-mail image and assurances of authenticity.\n\nTurns out, the artwork wasn't real, according to Picasso's daughter, Maya Picasso. And now Locke, who used to be a leading dealmaker in Atlanta's burgeoning folk art marketplace of the 1980s and 1990s, is in hot water because he hasn't returned the money.\n\nManhattan art dealer Chantal Park sued him for $5 million, plus the cost of the drawing, and the FBI paid a visit to Locke's home, interviewing him for three hours, he said.\n\nThe man who used to hobnob with Atlanta's wealthy and powerful said he's guilty only of being \"a foolish trusting soul\" who thought an Internet business offer was on the up-and-up.\n\nHe's still not convinced the drawing is a fake, despite Maya Picasso's letter, which says \"you can be sure that this l'oeuvre [work] is not from my father's hand.\"\n\n\"This is meaningless,\" Locke said, displaying a copy of the letter and questioning Maya Picasso's expertise during an interview at a coffee house in a Norcross shopping center.\n\nDubious business deals\n\nThe Picasso flap demonstrates how easy it is to be duped in the art world when contact is not face to face and how readily a dealer in need of money will pursue a proposition.\n\n\"At this point, I'm not on the top of the financial chart of the art world,\" said Locke, 49, who's been in the art and antiques business for 25 years.\n\nRecently, the father of two college-age daughters has faced more problems than just the Picasso litigation: bankruptcy, eviction and lawsuits from other disgruntled clients.\n\nPayPal, eBay's financial services arm, accused Locke of selling iPods on the auction site but not delivering the goods, and sought $90,000. The suit was settled for $65,000.\n\n\"He's a very personable guy. He just always has a dire need for money,\" said Keary Hayes, the real estate agent who put Locke in the four-bedroom home he lost.\n\nIn the 1990s, the folk art market in Atlanta was red-hot and Locke was reaping the financial rewards.\n\nHe helped former Georgia-Pacific CEO T. Marshall Hahn build his collection, part of which went to the High Museum. Hahn put Locke together with Barbara Archer to form the Archer-Locke Gallery in Buckhead, which specialized in self-taught art.\n\nBack then, visitors worldwide were flocking to Atlanta for the 1996 Olympics. Raw Southern art was on display at a standout show at City Hall East.\n\nThe well-dressed Locke, stocky with a ruddy complexion and light hair, circulated easily among the well-heeled.\n\n\"There was buzz about him,\" said Stephanie Tardell, a former folk art collector who met Locke around 1990. \"He had impressed me in the way that he had taken me to Marshall Hahn's office and his home.\"\n\nTardell was traveling from New Jersey to Atlanta to satisfy her appetite for paintings by Mattie Lou O'Kelley of Decatur and Howard Finster of Summerville. Locke helped sell some of her collection before their relationship soured.\n\n\"He was sort of a phenomenon of sorts among the people buying outsider art,\" said Linda Alexander, another collector. Alexander invested in Archer-Locke and won a judgment against Locke after the gallery closed in 1998.\n\nAgreement gone awry\n\nThe Picasso transaction began with an e-mail image from Henry Hernandez, a San Francisco man whom Locke said he didn't know. Locke forwarded the image to a private dealer in New York and she passed it on to Park, the Manhattan art dealer.\n\nPark forwarded the image to the Waterhouse & Dodd Gallery in London, which was interested in buying the drawing. Accompanying the image was documentation of its purported history: created in 1947, shown in a Paris gallery, owned by collectors in Palm Beach, Fla., and Maynard, Mass.\n\nThe gallery wired $145,000 to Locke with the understanding the money would be held in escrow until the gallery could examine the artwork and make a final decision.\n\nBut holding the money was never an option, Locke said, because the seller in Maynard, Biagio \"Luigi\" Cugini, would not release the drawing before getting paid.\n\nLocke sent Cugini $110,000 and kept $35,000 that was supposed to be shared with others involved in the deal. His cut, he said, was to be about $8,000.\n\nThe London gallery rejected the drawing because of condition problems, shipped it back to the United States and demanded its money back.\n\nLocke said he tried to recover the gallery's payment and had the drawing delivered to Cugini's house, but Cugini refused to go to the truck, yelling at Locke in Italian during a brief phone conversation.\n\nCugini eventually returned part of his payment, $46,000, which Locke kept along with the $35,000.\n\nFodder for memoir\n\nWhat happened to that $81,000? All Locke would say is that \"it's not available at the moment.\"\n\nPark, meanwhile, took possession of the drawing and sent it to Paris, where Maya Picasso issued her damning opinion.\n\nThe Internet has made it much easier to scam dealers who consider themselves excellent judges of character and \"things are done on a handshake,\" according to Don Hrycyk, the Los Angeles Police Department's art theft detective.\n\n\"Now, somebody doesn't have to physically appear,\" he said. That e-mail image of the Picasso drawing may or may not show the authentic artwork.\n\nHrycyk said he was familiar with Cugini and Hernandez, neither of whom could be reached for comment.\n\nLocke said in a few years he'll have something new to sell: his life story. He's working on a book about a career that began when his older brother took a vow of poverty to enter the priesthood and left him with a collection of Belleek Irish pottery, Waterford crystal, furniture and books.\n\nSince then, life has grown more complicated with intrigues and falsehoods, which Locke said will be reflected in his memoir.\n\n\"I'm writing it about the high end of the art world,\" he said, \"where people make statements and they have nothing to base them on.\"\n \nhttp://www.ajc.com/\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 9\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:39:09 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Germany.

August 2006 in das Museum eingestiegen ist. Die Uhren und andere gestohlene Ausstellungsst?cke haben einen Wert von 205.000 Euro. Sie sind bis heute verschwunden.\n\nDas Gericht st?tzte sich bei seinem Schuldspruch auf einen genetischen Fingerabdruck. Am Tatort war Blut des Angeklagten gefunden worden. Der aus Karlsruhe stammende Mann beharrte dagegen bis zuletzt darauf: ?Ich war noch nie in Furtwangen.?\n\nDer Richter sagte: ?Mit dem Strafma? sind Sie noch gut bedient.? Schlimmer w?re es nur gewesen, die ?Mona Lisa? zu stehlen. Der Staatsanwalt hatte f?nf Jahre Haft gefordert. Die Verteidigerin des Mannes pl?dierte f?r eine mildere Strafe, weil der Angeklagte nur aus Todesangst vor seinen Hinterm?nnern geleugnet habe. Auch das Gericht ging von unbekannten Drahtziehern aus, ?die das eigentliche Geld verdienen?. Zudem habe es beim Einbruch Komplizen geben k?nnen.\n\nErschwerend seien aber die Vorstrafen des Angeklagten. Dieser hatte als Achtj?hriger seinen ersten Strafeintrag erhalten. 15 Jahre seines Lebens sa? er im Gef?ngnis. In Rastatt und Stra?burg war er bereits in Museen eingebrochen. Die Polizei kam ihm ?ber die Blutspuren in Furtwangen auf die Schliche. In einem anderen Fall hatte er zuvor eine Speichelprobe abgeben m?ssen.\n\nDie gestohlenen Uhren stammen aus den Jahren 1880 bis 1920.

That's when B?dard started to doubt the art's origin, he testified.\nCaf? project abandoned, court told\n\nThe jury has already heard testimony from Pierre B?dard's ex-partner, Huguette Nicole, who described how she helped Myriam load some of the paintings in a van in 2002.\n\nNicole testified that at the time, she was growing increasingly suspicious of Mazhari as she got to know him better, and believed the sculptor and painter was conspiring to turn Myriam against her family. \n\n\"I had much doubt about him,\" she told the court on Tuesday.\n\nAround the same time, Nicole and Pierre B?dard were helping Mazhari and Myriam B?dard open a caf? in Quebec City area.\n\nNicole said she didn't like the way Myriam and her sisters were discussing their father, \"under the influence of Mr. Mazhari,\" she said.\n\nPierre B?dard testified that his involvement in the caf? project eventually waned because of tension that was surfacing between himself, his daughter and Mazhari.\n\n\"At a certain point, I heard they were talking behind my back,\" he said. \"I didn't need that.\"\n\nMyriam B?dard has been attending Mazhari's trial, where she has sat in the front row taking copious notes.\n\nMazhari's trial continues to the end of the week.\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 12\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:41:43 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] $200,000 missing from Bellevue Arts Museum\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <46552597.1010506@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n$200,000 missing from Bellevue Arts Museum\nThe Associated Press\nMay, 23, 2007\n\nA former employee of the Bellevue Arts Museum has come under scrutiny after $200,000 was found missing from museum accounts.\n\nMichael Monroe, executive director of the crafts museum, would not specify when the money went missing of for how long.\n\n\"The discovery (of the missing money) is recent,\" Monroe told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, \"but the (theft) occurred over a period of time.\"\n\nMonroe said the museum has hired a forensic auditor as well as a lawyer to safeguard its interests.\n\nHe told the museum's 2,000 members of the missing money in letter sent Friday. He said that \"discrepancies in our financial accounts revealed that our chief financial officer embezzled museum funds.\"\n\nThe employee, who has not been identified, was \"immediately removed\" and \"all financial records were secured,\" Monroe wrote.\n\nMonroe wouldn't say whether he'd filed a police report. Bellevue police spokesman Greg Grannis was unable to locate one.\n\nThe museum, formerly known as the Bellevue Art Museum, closed its doors in October 2003 amid financial troubles. It reopened in 2005 as the Bellevue Arts Museum.\n\nIts annual budget this year is $3 million, Monroe said, slightly up from last year's $2.6 million.\n\nhttp://www.bellinghamherald.com/\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 13\nDate: Thu, 24 May 2007 07:43:35 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] US. Art Thief Given A Chance To Clear His Record\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <46552607.5010801@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nArt Thief Given A Chance To Clear His Record\nBy Karen Florin\nPublished on 5/23/2007 in Home ?Region ?Region News\n\nThe handyman who stole an oil painting that eventually fetched $1 million at auction has been granted accelerated rehabilitation in New London Superior Court.\n\nThe first-degree larceny charge against Charles R. McSpieal Jr., 45, of Niantic, will be dismissed if he successfully completes two years of probation and performs 100 hours of community service. He had no criminal record, and the owner of the painting, artist Nelson White of Waterford, had no objection to McSpieal's application for accelerated rehabilitation.\n\n?I am sorry for any pain and inconvenience I may have brought to Mr. White and this court,? McSpieal said during a court hearing Tuesday.\n\nA longtime volunteer firefighter and paramedic, he said he appreciates the chance to resume that work, which he had been unable to do while the felony larceny charge was pending.\n\nDefense attorney John Newson told Judge Susan B. Handy that McSpieal is the kind of person the court would want to take a chance on ? somebody who will never turn up in court again. Newson said McSpieal and his wife had been involved in a serious motorcycle accident that disabled the wife, who was the primary income-earner. McSpieal learned at the same time that his mother was terminally ill.\n\nNewson said the personal issues are not an excuse for stealing the painting, but help to explain what was going on in McSpieal's life. While his longtime employer, White, was away, McSpieal took the painting and some other items from a shed on White's property while performing some electrical work. He sold the lot to an Old Saybrook antiques dealer for $100.\n\n?It was stupid,? Newson said. ?His exact words were, 'This was an issue of my being stupid and not using my mind for 30 seconds.' ''\n\nMcSpieal had no idea the painting, ?Chrysanthemums,? by French realist Henri Fanti-Latour, was so valuable, according to Newson. When White reported it missing, he told police it was worth $700,000. Old Saybrook antiques dealer Bernadina Blais kept the painting for a while, then said she had it appraised at the recommendation of a customer. When Shannon's Fine Art Auctioneers of Milford valued it at $150,000, she decided to put it up for auction. The painting sold for more than $1 million to a buyer in the Netherlands.\n\nA civil suit involving the antiques dealer has been settled, and McSpieal has also made restitution to the Town of Waterford, whose police department tracked down and retrieved the painting from the Netherlands. McSpieal has made an estimated $20,000 in restitution, but still faces a civil lawsuit brought by the auction house, which claims it is out $62,000.\n\nHandy said she was pleased about the restitution that had been made and would leave the one pending case to the civil court for remedy.\n\n?I clearly think he was just trying to turn a quick buck,? the judge said of McSpieal's theft. But for the fact that the picture ended up being worth more than $1 million, that would have been the end of it, she said.\n\nHandy said her primary concern from the outset of the case had been for the painting's owner, and that he has been ?made whole.?\n\n?The painting has been returned and is in excellent condition,? she said.\n\nTwo Waterford police officers had escorted the painting home, and it was eventually returned to White after it was photographed for the court file.\n\nhttp://www.theday.com\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 120\n****************************************\n\n"}
