I would really see changing or\nsetting the rate, pitch, and pun_level at boot a really good option\nespcially when booting a new installation or live CD and wanting to hear\neverything that is going on at a rate you want to hear it at and not one\nset by default.  Really this should not be that hard to make happen as\nwhen the driver starts up normally it sets the paramaters to defaults.\nIt could be made both configuration options in the kernel for each\nsynthisizer and plus command line options so if user gave input that\nwould be used instead of the defaults.On Sun, 22 Apr 2007, Gregory Nowak\nwrote:\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> On Sun, Apr 22, 2007 at 11:25:10AM -0500, Nick Gawronski wrote:\n> > on the speakup site I see no information on how to check in sources or\n> > changes, am I missing something?\n>\n> I seem to recall reading somewhere that you need to generate a unified diff,\n> and e-mail the result to Kirk.
