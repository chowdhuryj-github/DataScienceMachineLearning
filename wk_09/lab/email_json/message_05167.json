I have no idea why\nkfreebsd was mentioned in the original email.\n\nIf the debian desktop packages are going to reorganized for Lenny, then\nit would suit to make a list of the debian-desktop package goals first.\nSo far there is a general wish for splitting the packages by purpose. I\nagree with this and think it would make maintaining the packages\nsimpler. However it will be very important to limit the dependencies to\nprevent complex dependency chains from happening. Here are some ideas on\nthe packages that could be used. This is derived from emails on the list\nand anything that comes to mind at 3am EDT. :-)\n\ndesktop-base -\nThis package is responsible for providing base infrastructure and\nconfiguration mechanisms used by the debian-desktop package suite. To\nthat effect I feel that we should define and maintain the file system\nstructure for any shared elements in this package. In effect this makes\ndesktop-base the central package for directing and defining desktop\npackage policy and conformance. All debian desktop packages should\ndepend on this package in order to help maintain consistency.\n\ndesktop-artwork -\nThis would clearly be a package that provides desktop artwork for themes\nand other forms of visual improvements. This isn't just for the eye\ncandy people. This is equally important for visually impaired users or\nusers that need other forms of custom visual requirements. Initially I\nam considering themes and artwork for the visually impaired but it might\nbe feasible to support screen readers and other accessibility features.\nHowever that might be better suited for a package like\ndesktop-accessibility or similar.\n\ndesktop-scripts -\nThis would provide a collection of scripts the user may optionally use\nfor situations like auto mounting local drives and partitions. It might\nalso be good to include default scripts for creating basic backups and\nother useful tasks that people need. Each script would need to be\ndisabled by default and enabled using debconf to support preseeding.\n\nI think adding the prefix debian- to these package name is a good idea.\nAlthough the debian- prefix may seem unnecessary it makes creating\nthings like ubuntu-desktop-base and distroX-desktop-base [1] much\nsimpler. Not that I want this to happen, but it can't be prevented. So\nwhy not prepare for it now? Ideally the desktop-base package\nspecification could be used to apply default branding and configuration\nfor a derivative distribution using the alternative distroX-desktop-base\npackage. This brings to mind the possibility of using alternatives for\nthis sort of thing as well, but that seems overreaching at this stage.\nThis idea could definitely use Conflicts: to prevent multiple copies of\nthe desktop-base to be installed. Imagine being able to change the\nbranding using a simple:\n\tapt-get install distroX-desktop-base distroX-desktop-art\n\nSo if you agree with me assume that those package names get the prefix.\nThis is point well worth discussion beyond just the desktop-base package\nname.\n\nI don't think a desktop-configuration package is needed since we can\napply the configuration to the appropriate desktop related package. This\nis the approach I have in mind for desktop-scripts above. Additionally\ntrying to place all the configuration in a single package can create\nconfig file issues if not handled carefully.\n\nI don't think splitting desktop-art into GNOME, KDE, XFCE versions is\nnecessary or even a good idea. It will make it more difficult to\nsynchronize the art and c\\would require duplicate copies of the art\nused. Then again I might have missed something on this point.\n\nNow the big bugaboo... Localization.\n\nThe current packages don't support localization and don't really need\nthem now. However if we start setting up common scripts and provide\ndesktop interfaces to them with something like say zenity or kdialog\nthen it stands to reason that we will also need these to be localized in\nthe future. It also makes sense to provide a localization solution for\nthe distroX issue mentioned above. I dunno, maybe this is also a bit\noverreaching at this stage as well.\n\nOk, that's enough from this lurker. :-)\n\nThanks,\n\nMatthew P McGuire\n\nPS: Sorry for the top posting, I needed to organize my thoughts fully.\n\n[1] - Oh No!
