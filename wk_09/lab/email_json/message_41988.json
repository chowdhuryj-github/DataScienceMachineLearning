However MOPH will contuinue buy some\namont from generic company because it prevents the\nblackmail of big pharmas. He also reaffirms that  MOPH\nwill not revoke the CLs.\n    So this position is still confirmed. Report of\nmedia are not really well covered and not give any\ndetail.\n     Thanks for your recommend.\n     Kannikar\n\nKannikar KIJTIWATCHAKUL (Kar)\nMobile 66-85-0708954\nkakablue@yahoo.com\n\n\n      ___________________________________________________________________________________\nYou snooze, you lose.
