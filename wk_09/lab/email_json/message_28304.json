The blog was linked from Linux Today\nso due to the amount of press it will or has gotten, we need\nto respond.  I agree that any needed fixes are probably not\na big deal and that the blog was not to most technical review\nI've ever seen. But since no us has are really testing the\n3.0.x joins against Longhorn, now is a good time to start.\n\nNo huge rush.  But by 3.0.26 we should at least know\nwhat the playing field looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGRdqcIR7qMdg1EfYRAtBXAJ9l1qoLOaKit5MToheh4+5JbGxNJACfYIGM\nTK/9K+o/lIXJq8HIkamydZw=\n=YxvT\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
