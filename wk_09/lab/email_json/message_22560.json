It's the attribute reading\nkey--speakup+keypad period.\n>     What I'm wondering about is how, exactly, Speakup gets information on\nthe colors of the console, or of certain text therein?\n>     This is an issue which seems on the whole to be fairly complicated\nunder a Windows system: I've yet to really find a screen reader which will\nduplicate it.  I'm wondering, then, how Speakup does it?\n> Thanks much for indulging me,\n> Zack.\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
