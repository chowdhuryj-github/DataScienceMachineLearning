There\nare also many regex references online, such as:\n\n  http://www.regular-expressions.info/\n\nBTW, it would be preferable not to use 'c' to name an object in R, since\nc() is a function. While conflicts should, in general, not occur, it\neliminates such risk and makes for more easily readable code to not use\nfunction names for objects.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
