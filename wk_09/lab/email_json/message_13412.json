Yet, why would a utility take a risk on new technologies when they can still deliver a return to investors by maintaining the status quo? When it comes right down to it, the monetary bottom line is the only line and spending on pricey, newly-proven technologies is not always the best approach. Still, almost everyone will argue that the time has arrived for the next generation of the modern transmission grid.\n\u00a0\nSo where is the breaking point? A new superconductor project might cost twice as much as a traditional line, but at the same time, might replace several other projects due to the high voltage load and maintenance savings over time. Utilities seem to be very interested on reaching this next level of grid reliability, but how is the market pushing reliability through technology deployment? FERC and state level regulators have called for technology adoption to improve reliability and negate congestion trouble spots, but they are still having trouble encouraging utilities to invest. Is the market creating a sustainable reliability approach or are more regulatory tools needed?\n\u00a0\nThis day and a half EUCI conference will seek to shed light on this question of the costs and benefits of transmission technologies. Presenters will explore with attendees the key technology areas of concern, including specific, available technologies. State and federal regulators will speak to challenges in adopting regulatory tools that can encourage technology adoption. Several utilities will tell of their experience with new technology projects and several regional transmission organizations will look at items that improve reliability and electricity costs for customers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConference Sessions \n\u00a0\nThis conference is divided into five major sessions: \n\nFraming the Issue of Cost-Effective Technology Investment\n\nEmerging Technologies\n\nUtility Perspectives\n\nTechnology Policy\n\nRTO Perspectives\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nClick\n                        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n  Renewable \n                            Power Project Finance: The Tutorial\nApril 30 - May 2, 2007\n                            New York, NY \n  A Water \n                            Constrained Future - How Producers Can Minimize Impacts in the West\nSan Diego, CA\n                              May 1-2, 2007 \n   GasFair-PowerFair 2007\nToronto, Ont\n                            May 1-2, 2007 \n  Recognizing and \n                            Recovering Energy Theft\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Cost-Effective \n                            Transmission Technology\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Western \n                            Renewable Power Development Summit\nSan Francisco, CA\n                              May 7-9, 2007 \n   Solar Power Project Finance & Investment Summit\nSan Diego, CA\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  Gas Mart \n                            2007\nChicago, IL\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  In-Depth \n                            introduction to the Natural Gas Industry\nDallas, TX\n                              May 15-16, 2007 \n  Natural Gas \n                            Transactions, Trading and Origination for Non-Traders\nDallas, TX\n                              May 16-17, 2007 \n  Developing and \n                            Launching New Products and Services for Utilities\nDallas, TX\n                              May 17-18, 2007 \n  Performance \n                            Benchmarking For Energy Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007 \n  Pandemic \n                            Preparedness For Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007  \u00a0 \n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
