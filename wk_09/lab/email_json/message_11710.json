Of course, I noticed that the package is not available and that no binary is\u00a0 exists on the macromedia site for 64 bit architectures.\nAfter a few minutes on the net, I noticed that I was not the first to have this problem :) but I didn't find any\u00a0 tutorial either. The only page I got is from the french ubuntu documentation \nhttp://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/nspluginwrapper which I tried , but while executing the wrapping line, I get:# nspluginwrapper -i /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins32/libflashplayer.so/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: cannot execute binary file\nnspluginwrapper: no appropriate viewer found for /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins32/libflashplayer.soI don't really understand this message; all requiered packages have been installed successfully.Does anybody know how to get the non-free version of flashplayer working on iceweasel (or any other browser)? Or how to fix the error message I get with the ubuntu wrapping method?\nThanks a lot,Regards,Alexandre\n"}
