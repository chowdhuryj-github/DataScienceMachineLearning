See http://rejon.org/ on each blog post to see the way there is a wordpress pluging that allows for many of these sites social bookmarks to be shared.\n\nYes, this is a simple code hack, but one that will allow ccHost content to be dugg easily by members.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: Jon Phillips (kidproto)\nDate: 2007-05-16 11:29\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=914868\nOriginator: YES\n\nadd bloglines support and other generic \"blog this\" services\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can respond by visiting: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=559969&aid=1702541&group_id=80503\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
