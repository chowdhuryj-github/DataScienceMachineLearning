It's very similar to t-test but\nMann-Whitney U test is not as affected by violation of the homogeneity of\nvariance assumption as t-test is.\n\nRob\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
