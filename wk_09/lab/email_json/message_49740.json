How about just saying its not selectable for spark and\nseeing if we can get it to work for 2.6.22 elsewhere which I am sure\nKirk is working on?  \n\nThe user space idea may be something worth considering as we no longer\nget the boot messages we used to get, however this would be a much\nbigger change.  Kirk is working on a git patch set which may help, but\nits broke right now.\n\n\non Sunday 06/17/2007 William Hubbs(williamh@gentoo.org) wrote\n > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n > Hash: SHA1\n > \n > All,\n > \n > because of this bug [1], gentoo linux will be dropping support for speakup in its official kernels starting at 2.6.22.\n > \n > [1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177794\n > \n > Is there any possibility at all that speakup could be moved into user space as the bug suggests?
