Is someone interested in organizing \nsuch a thing?\n\nOf course, one can try to solve the Matlab Problems Sets in R, but I \nthink it could be fun to have something like this also for R.\n\nThanks and have a nice weekend everyone,\nRoland\n\nP.S. I have the impression that the R-Help ML is some kind of \nprogramming contest, when people try to contribute more efficient, \nelegant, smaller, faster, ... solutions to a question than someone \nbefore. :-D\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
