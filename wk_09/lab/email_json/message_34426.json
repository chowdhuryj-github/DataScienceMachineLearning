Software shouldn't guess what\ncharacter I may have meant.\n\nMicrosoft Word already has this misfeature of replacing (C) with\nthe c-in-a-circle symbol. It's most annoying, especially when\nyou have to refer to, say, article 52(c) or item (3)(c).\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
