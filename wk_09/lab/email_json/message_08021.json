Can/ should lambda be greater than 1 ?\n\nI have conflicting (or what appears conflicting to me) sources that use lambda >= 0, without any upper limit, but that makes the search space infinite.. right ??\n\nSo, perhaps my question is: is there an upper limit to lambda. Does the value of lambda convey something about my data ?\n\nThanks a lot,\nSikander\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
