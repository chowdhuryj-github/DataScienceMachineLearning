Given the pre-existing\ndifferences among groups, it makes sense to report adjusted means (aka\nleast squares means though I estimated them via predictions from lme\nrather than lm).\n\nI would like to report effect sizes (Cohen's d) calculated as:\n\n(Mean1-Mean2)/sqrt(((N1*VAR1)+(N2*VAR2))/(N1+N2))\n\nCan anyone provide advice on what would be a reasonable value to use for\nthe variance estimate in the equation?\n\nAny other thoughts on how to calculate effect sizes on adjusted mean\nvalues?\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul\n \n\nLTC Paul D.
