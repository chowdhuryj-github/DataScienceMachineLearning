For instance,\nthis can happen if you mistakenly type something into a cell; it can also\nchange your column classes when you don't - for example:\n\n> options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE)\n> x <- data.frame(letters[1:5],1:5)\n> sapply(x,class)\nletters.1.5.         X1.5 \n    \"factor\"    \"integer\" \n> fix(x) # no user-changes made\n> sapply(x,class)\nletters.1.5.         X1.5 \n    \"factor\"    \"numeric\" \n\n(3) I believe Deepayan Sarkar contributed the tab-completion capability at\nthe command line. So unless you have a lot of objects beginning with\n'AuroraStoch...' you should be able to type a few letters and let the\nauto-completion handle the rest.\n\nBest regards,\n\nST\n\n\n--- Horace Tso  wrote:\n\n> Dear list,\n> \n> First apologize that this is trivial and just betrays my slothfulness at\n> the keyboard.
