It's true that the disk was full,\nbut clobbering some of the topic libraries didn't help matters. It\nshowed the same symptoms on reboot. (No X start, occasional screen\nblanking, and \"Id 3 spawning too fast\".)\n\n I'm not sure how to \"capture\" log and get it to the world; apparently\nmy olpc can't see the network to scp anything. The best I can do is\npage through it and get screen captures. Should I do that?\n\nSince I'm an olpc novice and not a Linux expert I am probably not the\nperson to work this out. I really have very little idea what to expect\nwhen it does work. And it appears that others are having problems with\n385 on OS X.\n\nCan you refer us to an earlier build known to work on Parallels? I'd\nlike to be able to touch Sugar before Wednesday.\n\nmt\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
