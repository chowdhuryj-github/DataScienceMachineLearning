I have three sets of numeral data, 2 sets are paired and a  \nthird is independent of the other two. For each of these sets I have  \nobtained their basic statistics (mean, median, stdv, range ...).    \nNow I want to compare if these sets differ. I could compare the mean  \ndoing a basic T test . However, I was looking for a test to compare  \nthe medians using R.   If that is possible I would love to hear the  \nspecifics.\nThanks in advance for any help,\nRegards,\n\n\npedro reche\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
