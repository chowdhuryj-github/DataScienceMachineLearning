Please do not forget to submit your\nproposals by Sunday, 13th May 2007. Information on what we're looking\nfor exactly and what we can offer to moderators (e.g.\ntravel/accommodation refund) can be found at:\n  http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/cfh.html\n\nThe Call for Papers deadline is less than 3 weeks away from today:\n  http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/cfp.html\n\nThe theme for this year's conference is \"Social Perl\", which we hope\nwill inspire submissions for this and related topics. If Perl has helped\nyou or your company to get people together, or if you can report how\nPerl is \"social\" to other programming languages, or how Perl may profit\nfrom inspirations from other languages, we'd like to hear about it.\nAlthough this is our main topic for the conference, it will not be the\nonly one, and as such we will also be accepting talks on just about any\ntheme.\n\nTypes of talks include 20 or 40 minutes talks, 60-90 minute tutorials,\nor 3 hour Hack-a-thons, BOFs or Workshops.\n\nThere are still some slots free!\n\nHope to see you in Vienna,\nMichael Kr?ll\non behalf of Vienna.pm\n\n-- \n063A F25E B064 A98F A479  1690 78CD D023 5E2A 6688\nhttp://zis.uibk.ac.at/.m/uibk.ac.at_pgp_pubkey.asc\n_______________________________________________\nConferences mailing list\nConferences@yapceurope.org\nhttp://lists.yapceurope.org/mailman/listinfo/conferences\n\n----- End forwarded message -----\n\n-- \n#!/usr/bin/perl                               http://domm.zsi.at\nfor(ref bless{},just'another'perl'hacker){s-:+-$\"-g&&print$_.$/}\n\n"}
