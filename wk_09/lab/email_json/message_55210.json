As I said\nearlier, these toolchains are very tricky compatibility wise. It is\nmost likely still possible but would require more work that I did\nthree years ago because the current system at that time was\nstill compatible with the glibc for compilation. I plan to try to do\na more recent build with slackware 11.0 in the near future, so I\nmay have updated instructions at some point, but I can't make\nany promises because it takes a lot of experimentation to do\nthose toolchain builds. If you really want that old tts engine to\nwork, it may actually be easier to go with the supported distros\nlike debian or ubuntu. I think IBM made a fairly huge mistake\nwhen they packaged this engine.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
