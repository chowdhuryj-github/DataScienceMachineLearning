But now I prescribe my patients a natural alternative with no side effects.   It safely reduces cholesterol absorption by 40% or more, clinical tests show.  Ask your doctor if he's heard about it yet,  because drugs like Lipitor\u00ae, Zocor\u00ae, Crestor\u00ae and the other statins can cause a whole new set of problems. In fact...  The most common question on our Customer Care Hotline is, \"Will I be able to discontinue taking statins?\"  Yes, many patients get their prescriptions cut or even discontinued after just a few months. So ask your doctor to let you try this new  safe, natural alternative. It really works. But please follow your doctor's advice, and don't stop taking any prescription until you get your physician's okay.  Sincerely,  Dr Arlene Donar Medical Director CholesterolWatchers                   \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
