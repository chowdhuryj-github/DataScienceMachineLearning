Of course you \nhave the choice to wait until others do so.  But if you don't want to \nwait, I don't see the point in going around rather than going straight.\n\nBest regards, Tomas\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
