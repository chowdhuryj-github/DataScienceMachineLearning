Thanks.\n\nYou might want to have a look at ?read.table for more details, but  \nthe following should do it:\n\ntest <- read.table(\"data.txt\", colClasses = \"character\", sep=\"\\t\",  \nquote=\"\\\"\")\n\nEssentially by default read.table sees both \" and ' as quote  \ndelimiters. In your data, you only want \" as a quote delimiter.\n\n> Alex Tsoi-\n\nHaris Skiadas\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science\nHanover College\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
