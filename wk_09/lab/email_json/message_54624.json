For example, if I were to execute get file1.tar,\nand get file2.tar, I want get file2.tar to be executed only after get\nfile1.tar is done.\n\nI see that lftp has a queue command. Does anyone know if this would\nwork the way I expect? What I mean is if I execute:\n\nqueue get file1.tar\nqueue get file2.tar\n\nin lftp, would that in fact wait to download file2.tar until the\ndownload of file1.tar was complete?\n\nIf the queue command in lftp doesn't work this way, then is there\nanother command that would do what I want? If lftp can't do what I\nwant, then can ncftp do that? If so, then how? I have looked through\nthe ncftp man page as well, and this doesn't seem to be doable in\nncftp. If neither lftp or ncftp can do what I want, then is there\nanother ftp client for gnu/linux that can?\n\nJust to clarify, I don't want to time-schedule the downloads, I simply\nwant them to happen sequentially one after another, in a specific\norder, (I.E. file2.tar can download right after file1.tar, but it\ncan't start downloading while file1.tar is still being downloaded).\n\nOn another note, does anyone know for sure if put in lftp or ncftp\nwill retry an upload until it successfully completes, if the upload\nkeeps being interrupted, say due to network issues? I'm fairly sure the\nanswer here for both programs is yes, but I wanted to make\ncertain. Thanks in advance.\n\nGreg\n\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGf2AO7s9z/XlyUyARAgA1AKDdu8Li7khgpV4H0rRh424xjude3ACdFnRw\nTg/Zd+5f0BiU2MmlslaaXWk=\n=QDyq\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n__________ NOD32 2351 (20070625) Information __________\n\nThis message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\nhttp://www.eset.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
