With the IconButton, how do I use my own set of icons?I'm guessing it's something like having the svg icons in a special directory of the bundle, I just don't know which one.\nAlso, can someone give me the path to the source for the sugar widgets? It's the best place to get their different properties, isn't it? Or is there some kind of generated documentation?Thank you\nThibaut Lamadon\n"}
