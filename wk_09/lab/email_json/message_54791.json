It's hard to say what that order is, but we know\nwhat it's not. It's not alphabetical order, and it's not the order\nthat elements were stored into the hash. It's not random order, which\nmight be nice, and it's not sorted by value, as convenient as that\nwould be. It's not an order that is sure to be the same for every\nrelease of Perl, for every implementation of Perl, or even every time\nyou run your program with the same perl binary on the same OS on the\nsame day. It's not any order that's useful for anybody but Perl, in\nfact, so we may as well say it's in no order at all. But it is in\n_some_ order; keys(), values(), and each() all use the same,\nrepeatable, order (at least, until you add new items to the hash).\n\nIf you need any particular order, of course, that's easy to get. You\ncan either sort items directly into the order you want, or you could\nuse a module that keeps a hash in order for you.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
