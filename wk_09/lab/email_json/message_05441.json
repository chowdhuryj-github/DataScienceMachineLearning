Several people at the last\nmeeting expressed an interest in starting to work on XO related\nprojects and it would be a great inspiration to see one in person.\n\nThe next meeting is this Thursday, the 19th.\n\nTake care,\n  -Brian\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
