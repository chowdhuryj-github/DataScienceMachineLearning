Apparently it was added with 5.8.  So, amend my\nanswer to if your code might run on a pre-Perl 5.8 interpreter use\nIO::String, otherwise use the new functionality.\n\nfrom perldoc -f open\n               Since v5.8.0, perl has built using PerlIO by default.  Unless\n               you've changed this (i.e. Configure -Uuseperlio), you can open\n               file handles to \"in memory\" files held in Perl scalars via:\n\n                   open($fh, '>', \\$variable) || ..\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
