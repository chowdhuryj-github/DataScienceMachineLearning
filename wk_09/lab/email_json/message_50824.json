(All GPL and FDL of course)\nIt's used in classrooms to teach young students the basic concepts of\nprogramming for over three years now and it now supports eight\nlanguages.\nIt's stable and it runs, almost, perfectly on the XO.\n\nI'm currently working on adding the lessons to the package and turning it\ninto a olpc \"activity bundle\".\n\nRegards,\nStas Zytkiewicz\n\n-- \nA collection of educational activities for schools\nhttp://www.schoolsplay.org\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
