If flite is the only synth, \nthen you should be able to load the software speech module, start speechd-up and \nflight should talk.  To test flite before making it work with speakup, type \nflite followed by anything you want flite to say.  If you have multiple software \nsynths installed, look at your speech-distapcher configuration files to ensure \nyou're working with the correct synth.\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Littlefield, Tyler\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Thursday, May 24, 2007 12:56 PM\nSubject: flite with speakup config?\n\n\n> Hello list,\n> I may have to leave tomorrow night at around 5 PM MST.\n> I'm going to be brutally forced in to using a console for.. everything.\n> So, I've got a couple questions.\n> I know i can pass sftsynth as an argument on the kernel command line.\n> But, what do I have to do, in order to get flite working with speakup?\n> Also, how good is lynx with browsing the internet?\n> Any help is really appriciated,\n> Thanks,\n> ~~TheCreator~~\n> [My programs don't have bugs; just randomly added features]\n> msn:\n> compgeek13@gmail.com\n> aim: st8amnd2005\n> skype: st8amnd127\n> vertigo head coder\n> web: tysdomain.com\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n> \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
