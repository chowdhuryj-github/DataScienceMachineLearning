It also \nprodused a plot of each cluster and the mean for each cluster of each \nvariable - and i guess this is what you are after! But depending of which \nparameters you are using for the cluster analysis, the package is extremely \nslow if you have more than 5000 datapoints. Maybe you can take the function \napart to see where and what generates the plot and use that for your \nanalysis.\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nMonica Palaseanu-Lovejoy\n\n\nMessage: 35\nDate: Tue, 10 Apr 2007 19:51:24 +0000 (GMT)\nFrom: nathaniel Grey \nSubject: [R] Kmeans cluster analysis\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nMessage-ID: <352480.52445.qm@web23402.mail.ird.yahoo.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nHello,\n\nI have a data-set containing 22 variables, after appropriate \ntransformations etc I ran a\nkmeans cluster analysis for 4 clusters , I ran it 20 times to find a result \nwith the lowest\nwithin sum of squares.\n\nMy question is how best do I go about finding out what the characteristics \nare of each cluster?\nIs one cluster dominated by a particular set of variables or by a particular \nvariable?\n\nThe only way I know is to to look at the means for each variable for each \ncluster, but as there\nare 22 variables this is time consuming.\n\nIs there a way to graphically represent the clusters in relation to the \nvariables...if so I\nmight need some guidance on the coding as I am new to the R environment.\n\nAny advice and direction would be gratefully received.\n\nbest wishes,\n\nNataniel Grey\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nLive! http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/mcrssaub0050001411mrt/direct/01/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
