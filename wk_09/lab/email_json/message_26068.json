I decide.\n\nPerhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself.\n\nThey say you can't do it, but sometimes it doesn't always work.\n\nGood enough never is.\n\nOptimism is the cheerful frame of mind that enables a teakettle to sing, though in hot water up to its nose.\n\nWhen Nature has work to be done, she creates a genius to do it.\n\nSeek the friend who's hand helped you and tell them what they mean to you.\n\nMany lick before they bite.\n\nAmbition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds.\n\nI wear my heart on my sleeve.\n\nA friend who cannot at a pinch remember a thing or two that never happened is as bad as one who does not know how to forget.\n\nDon't steal thou it never thus compete successfully in business. Cheat.\n\nA man must earnestly want.\n\n\n"}
