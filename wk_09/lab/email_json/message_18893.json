I changed the\nvalue to 61 in the reg-tests-1.R file, and then make check runs with\nno errors.\n\n> This could be one of those cases where your system (which CPU, what\n> compilers?) is unusually inaccurate, but Linux systems do not usually\n> differ much in their accuracies on the same CPU.\n\nIt is somewhat disconcerting that my system is unusually inaccurate.\nI'm running Intel Xeon 3.20GHz CPUs and I've been using gcc 4.1.1 and\nifort to compile R (these are what the compile script choose by\ndefault on my system). Perhaps it is a bad idea to mix the GNU and\nIntel compilers?\n\n> I've checked several systems, as see maximum values of around 40.\n>\n> R 2.5.0 has an updated LAPACK so it will be different from 2.4.1.

When I set F77=g77, make check finishes fine,\nand running the same test\n\n> abs(lam - lam2[i])/Meps\n[1] 32  8 17  1  2\n\nwhich makes me more comfortable. Also, if I use the g95 compiler\n(./configure F77=g95), the eigen test gives\n\n> abs(lam - lam2[i])/Meps\n[1] 48.0 10.0 10.5  9.0  6.0\n\nSo, I suppose I will use the g77 compiler.\n\nEric Thompson\nTufts University\nCivil & Environmental Engineering\nGraduate Student\n\n\n> On Fri, 27 Apr 2007, Eric Thompson wrote:\n>\n> > Today I tried to install the R-2.5.0 (currently running R-2.4.1) on\n> > Mandriva Linux.
