There's a\nmore detailed description at\n\nhttp://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf\n\nbut here are the non-standard evaluation rules as I understand them:\ngiven a name in either (1) the formula or (2) ``special'' arguments like\n'weights' in this case, or 'subset', try to find the name\n\n1. in 'data'\n2. failing that, in environment(formula)\n3. failing that, in the enclosing environment, and so on.\n\nBy 'name', I mean a symbol, such as 'Age' or 'myweight'.  So\nbasically, everything is as you would expect if the name is visible in\ndata, but if not, the search starts in the environment of the formula,\nnot the environment where the function call is being made (which is\nthe standard evaulation behaviour).  This is a feature, not a bug\n(things would be a lot more confusing if it were the other way round).\n\n\nWith this in mind, either of the following might do what you want:\n\nbadFunction <- function(mydata, myformula) {\n    mydata$myweight <- abs(rnorm(nrow(mydata)))\n    hyp <-\n        rpart(myformula,\n              data=mydata,\n              weights=myweight,\n              method=\"class\")\n    prev <- hyp\n}\n\n\nbadFunction <- function(mydata, myformula) {\n    myweight <- abs(rnorm(nrow(mydata)))\n    environment(myformula) <- environment()\n    hyp <-\n        rpart(myformula,\n              data=mydata,\n              weights=myweight,\n              method=\"class\")\n    prev <- hyp\n}\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
