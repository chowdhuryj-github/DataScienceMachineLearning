I know there are tools\nfor mDNS but does anyone admin'ing Samba servers care?\nIt's not so much a technical question as it is a popularity\nvote.  If no one uses the feature, it will bit rot.  And\nthat would leave us in worse shape than having no mDNS\nsupport at all.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGHRd9IR7qMdg1EfYRAkhPAKCdtsWR/wqWOPlXGm0hn8khQGFzxgCgwmYo\nvaD9oiXVexsganoo/OV+bnU=\n=odF1\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
