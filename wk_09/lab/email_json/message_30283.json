You could also consult \nsome introductory literature which can be find on CRAN, especially about \ndata manipulation and linear models. Maindonald, Verzani or Faraway is a \ngood starting choice.\n\nRegards\nPetr\n\n\n> \n> anova(lm(......this is where i am not sure how to put them. \n> \n> is this something to do with anova(lm(dependent~independent*independent,\n> data=name)\n> \n> if they are all independent, how do i put them together?\n> \n> thanks.\n> \n> \n> Ben Bolker-2 wrote:\n> > \n> > \n> > \n> > CrazyJoe  hotmail.com> writes:\n> > \n> >> \n> >> I am very new to R.
