There could have been some systematic error that is\nthrowing things off.  It seems safer to leave the intercept in and let\nthe data show that the intercept is insignificantly small.  However, I\ndon't really know enough to know whether that is always the best\napproach.  (And given that R provides a facility for excluding the\nintercept, I suspect there must be some good reason for doing so in\nsome circumstances.)\n\n\n-- \nPaul Lynch\nAquilent, Inc.\nNational Library of Medicine (Contractor)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
