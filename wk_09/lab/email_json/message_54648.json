Is the knots option used to define the subintervals for each piece of the cubic spline? If yes and there are k knots, then why does the coefficients field in the returned object from gam only list k coefficients? Shouldn't there be 4k -4 coefficients?\n\nSincerely,\n\nBill\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
