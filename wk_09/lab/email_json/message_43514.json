Have you contacted SPSS\nand asked them to explain their deviant results?\n\nIt seems that biplot.correspondence is undocumented. However, it has argument\n'type' which defaults to \"symmetric\", other alternative being \"rows\" and\n\"columns\". Intelligent guess is that this selects the scaling of row and column\nscores, and type=\"symmetric\" scales both. By selecting type=\"columns\", only\ncolumns are scaled and the -2 value for a row will be displayed (which proves\nthat the guess was correct).\n\nI don't have a clue how SPSS scales results, but I guess that the differences in\nthe results may be due to different scalings. Function corresp gives you\nweighted orthonormal row and column scores, but scales these in the plot like\nspecified. It may be that SPSS does the scaling already in the printout (and\ndoes not give you the choice of type?). Another possible source of difference is\nthat corresp gives you \"canonical correlations\" whereas some other program or\nfunction may give you their squares, a.k.a. eigenvalues. Moreover, the sign is\narbitrary so that negative and positive scores may be switched between programs. \n\nI hope this helps, \n\nJari Oksanen\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
