Maybe you mean \na tolerance ellipse for the implied bivariate normal distribution?\n\n> I've searched through the MASS library but don't see a separate command\n> that could produce this graph.

It is possible you were using \nmethods from package 'robustbase', such as covPlot?\n\n\nThe author of cov.rob.\n\n\n> Thanks for any help,\n\n> Dr. Jenifer Larson-Hall\n> Assistant Professor of Linguistics\n> University of North Texas\n> (940)369-8950\n\n-- \nBrian D.
