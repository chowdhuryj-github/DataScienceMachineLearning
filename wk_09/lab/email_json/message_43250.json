Are you loading snd_pcm_oss, snd_mixer_oss, and possibly \nsnd_seq_oss?  I can't believe that Debian doesn't load Alsa modules \nautomatically!  Even Slackware does that.  BTW, to get Mplayer to use Alsa \nby default, add this to your .mplayer/config.\n\nao=alsa\n\nFirst, make sure that Mplayer supports Alsa by running the command \n\"mplayer -ao help\" which will show what audio devices are compiled in.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
