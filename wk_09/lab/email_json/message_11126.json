Given that these guesses are correct:\nThe first parameter of MonteCarloOption should read \"delta.t\", not \"dt\" \n(at least in fOptions version 241.68). If you are using \"dt\" because you \nhave an old version of fOptions and \"dt\" is correct for that version, \ntry updating fOptions, otherwise maybe changing \"dt\" to \"delta.t\" helps.\nRegards,\n\n  Martin\n\ngyadav@ccilindia.co.in wrote:\n> Hello R experts\n>\n> What does this error means and how to resolve this issue (cannot change \n> value of locked binding for ).
