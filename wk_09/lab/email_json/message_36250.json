COMING SOON: EJB 3.O PROJECTS \n\nIn the next few weeks TopCoder plans to release a dozen or more EJB 3.0 entity bean projects directly to development, and we're giving you a heads-up!  We'll be looking to have collections of simple entity classes developed for use with a Java Persistence API (JPA) EntityManager, along with corresponding XML O/R mapping files.  If you haven't looked into JPA yet, then this might be a good opportunity to learn.  (And if you have experience with Hibernate then you will find yourself right at home -- it implements JPA.)\n\nIf you want to read up on EJB 3.0 entities and JPA then here are some resources:\n* http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp\n* http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr220/index.html\n* http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/05/17/standardizing-with-ejb3-java-persistence-api.html\n* http://www.javabeat.net/javabeat/ejb3/articles/2007/04/introduction_to_java_persistence_api_jpa_ejb_3_0_1.php\n\nIf you want to experiment with EJB 3 persistence then there are many application servers you could use, but JBoss 4.0.5 might give you the best orientation to the upcoming components [hint].\n\n\n=================================================================\n3. RELIABILITY BONUSES HAVE BEEN INCREASED!\n\nIt pays to be reliable! Design & Development reliability bonuses are increasing, with the top two bonus levels increasing to 20% and 50%. The new bonus structure goes into effect for projects launching after 9:00 AM on May 24, 2007.\n\n* Design reliability guidelines: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=support&d3=desReliability\n* Development reliability guidelines: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=dev&d2=support&d3=devReliability\n\n\n=================================================================\n4. THE DIGITAL RUN 2007.5 SEASON IS NOW UNDERWAY\n\nThe Digital Run is back for another season and bigger than before. Prizes have been doubled for Design & Development, and there's more than $90,000 at stake in the new Assembly Cup Series.
