The way I prefer it is an easy \nlicense, a license which makes it possible that I can work on another \nPC, without paying a lot of money. R produces quite good results and is \nwidely used. That makes it a statistical package that I want.\nThe other thing is that working with large datasets requires \"some\" \neffort by software makers to get it working. I doubt if R has the \ncapability of working consistently with large datasets. That is an issue \nI think. I have done some comparisons between SPSS and R, and R seems to \nbe performing allright, so I can do computations with it. Nonetheless: \nthe data handling is not quite as good I think in comparison with SAS.\n\nWhen I started doing statistics there were about three packages: SPSS, \nSAS and BMDP (at least: these were available). On a PC you were required \nto use SPSS.\nNowadays there are hundreds, some with excellent database facilities, or \nyou can compute the newest statistical tests, or an exotic one. I \nhaven't got a clue how to work with new database facilities. dBase was \nmy only database education and everything has changed. So I cannot \nanswer if R is capable of working with large datasets in relation to \ndatabases. I really don't know. The only thing I know that if I compute \na ChiSq, it works on a relatively large dataset (not Fisher tests by the \nway). The same with a likelihood procedure, or tabulations including \nnon-parametrics or factor analysis.   But databases are an issue I've \nbeen told by a guy who works with R. SAS was a better option he told me.\n\nSo what's the big deal about S using files instead of memory like R. I \ndon't get the point. Isn't there enough swap space for S? (Who cares \nanyway: it works, isn't it?) Or are there any problems with S and large \ndatasets? I don't get it. You use them, Greg. So you might discuss that \nissue.\n\nWilfred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe licences keep changing, some have in the past but don't now, some\nyou can get an additional licence for home at a discounted price. Some\nit depends on the type of licence you have at work (currently our SAS\nlicence is such that the 3 people in my group can all have it installed,\nbut at most 1 can be using it at any 1 time, how does that affect\ninstalling/using it at home).  I may be able to install some of the\nsoftware at home also, but for most of them I have given up trying to\nfigure out the legality of it and so I have not installed them at home\nto be on the safe side.\n\nSome of the doctors I work with who are also affiliated with the local\nuniversity have mentioned that they can get a discounted academic\nversion of SAS and could use that, but my interpretation of the academic\nlicence that one showed me (probably not the most recent) said (in my\ninterpretation, I am not a lawyer) that if they published the results\nwithout paying a licence upgrade fee, they would be violating the\nlicence (the academic version was intended for teaching only).\n\nThe R licence on the other hand is pretty clear that I can install it\nand use it pretty much anywhere I want.\n\nYou are right in correcting me, R is not the only package that can be\nused on multiple computers.  I do think it is the most straight forward\nof the good ones.\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
