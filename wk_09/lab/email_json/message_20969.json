Let me try to remember the\nsteps I took.\n\nI installed the ipw2200-source package and went to the sourceforge\nsite for the firmware.  I put the firmware in /lib/firmware.  I then\nused module-assistant to compile the source (m-a prepare : m-a a-i\nipw2100 in my case).  m-a does it all for you, extracts the source,\ncompiles it, and installs the modules.  See man module-assistant.\nAfter that it's just a matter of finding out what the card can do and\nhow to tell it to do it.  :-)\n\nI hope that is the answer you were after.\n\nRegards\n\nWayne\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
