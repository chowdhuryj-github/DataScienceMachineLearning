But this story really happened. Two young women viciously \n      murdered in their home by an unknown attacker with a knife who disappeared \n      into the night. And it happened on Halloween. The scene of the crime was \n      the beautiful Napa Valley, America's premiere wine country in California. \n      That made the crime seem even more brutal because killings like that are \n      unheard of in Napa. As we covered the story of the crime three years ago, \n      the killer was still at large and the chance of finding him began to \n      dwindle with each passing month. The families grew frustrated as police \n      seemed unable to turn up new evidence or find suspects. And then it \n      happened... an ending to this story almost a year to the month of the \n      murders. I won't spoil it... the accused killer is someone no one \n      suspected. I hope you'll join us on Saturday night.\" - Bill \n      Lagattuta 48 Hours Mystery airs Saturdays at \n      10pmET/PT FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WHY NOT READ THE \n      BOOK? 48 Hours Mystery, Nightmare in \n      Napa is now available in bookstores and online at \n      Amazon.com Click Here. This is the first in a brand \n      new series of true crime books published by Simon and Schuster, Pocket \n      Books. Here's more from 48 Hours \n      producer and author Paul LaRosa. \"Nightmare in Napa \n      is the first in a series of true crime books based on the broadcasts of \n      CBS News' 48 Hours Mystery. It is the \n      chilling story of what happened to two women in a house in Napa, \n      California on Halloween night, 2004. 48 Hours \n      Mystery already had produced an hour on the story when Executive \n      Producer Susan Zirinsky and Executive Editor Al Briganti \n      hatched the idea to do a series of true crime books. They asked me to get \n      involved and write the first book because I had then recently published a \n      true crime book of my own called Tacoma Confidential. I \n      began reviewing all the tapes from the Napa broadcast and, as always, \n      there were a lot. That's something most viewers do not realize. In \n      producing any hour for 48 Hours Mystery, producers typically \n      will supervise the videotaping of more than one hundred hours of \n      interviews and other material. All of those hours are edited down to make \n      a compelling, fast-moving, one-hour broadcast for prime-time television. \n      This should give you an idea of the wealth and breadth of material we \n      compile for each broadcast. Because of time restrictions, a lot of \n      material never makes it onto the air. So much is left out that, well, you \n      could write a book, and that's just what we're going to do in this series. \n      Just under three-hundred, thirty-minute tapes existed for the \n      first hour. I went through a good portion of them but decided I had to go \n      to Napa and meet the principals and get a feel for the town and the Napa \n      Valley. So that's what I did. I got to meet, have lunch with or email many \n      of those involved with the story. In some cases, I did original reporting. \n      The original hour ended with the arrest of the murderer but now the case \n      had to wind its way through the courts. I followed it every step of the \n      way, culminating with the dramatic sentencing of the defendant in January, \n      2007. Along the way, I got a real sense for the lives of the two \n      murder victims: Adriane Insogna and Leslie Mazzara, and I hope that I've \n      been true to their memories in the book. They were both special young \n      women whose families are heartbroken by their loss. In many ways, the most \n      surprising aspect of the story is not the murder itself but the identity \n      of the murderer and his reasons for doing what he did.

And Nancy Cordes will report on the \n      investigation into the pet food contamination scare. The FDA suggests that \n      much of the recalled pet food may have been intentionally spiked with an \n      industrial chemical that would boost their protein content. We\u2019ll take a \n      closer look. Meanwhile, the stock market is racing toward a new \n      milestone \u2013 thanks to strong earnings reports from Internet superstar \n      Google Inc.

As a nation, we've been in this situation before and it seems \n      to be playing out in a very similar manner. So are we all-talk or are we \n      accomplishing something? If so, what? After all, at the bottom of every \n      report and every debate is the desire for everyone to be safe all the \n      time. Is that possible? And what are we willing to give up in order to \n      make that possible? What factors are contributing to these shootings? And \n      is there something inherently American about them? Correspondent Martha \n      Teichner looks for answers on Sunday Morning. JOEL GREY: Joel Grey is one of just a handful of \n      actors to win an Oscar and a Tony for the same role.

RACHEL CARSON: \n      Mild-mannered scientist and writer Rachel Carson was an unlikely activist, \n      but her book, Silent Spring, is credited with starting the \n      environmental movement. Her legacy can be seen in the formation of the \n      Environmental Protection Agency, which in 1972 banned the DDT pesticide in \n      this country, and can be found in today's debates over global warming, \n      clean energy, and organic food.
