Either use CPAN\n\nperl -MCPAN -e install Curses\n\nor download the module from CPAN, decompress it, change directory into\nit, and type\nperl Makefile.pl --prefix=/home/user/perl\nmake\nmake test\nmake install\n\nAfter you install the module you can either set the PERL5LIB\nenvironmental variable or add a \"use lib\" pragma to the start of the\nyour script.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
