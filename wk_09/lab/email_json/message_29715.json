I started with perl 4 or so as MacPerl with Apple's MPW as a shell. Now, at age 72, I do worry that perl 6 may be too late for me. It's been two years since I got to the point of using the * sigl in perl 5 and I still have a lot to learn about that.\n\nFORTRAN forever.\n-- \n\nApplescript syntax is like English spelling:\nRoughly, though not thoroughly, thought through.\n\n"}
