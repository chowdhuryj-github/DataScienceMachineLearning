See ?windows\n3. prior to your xyplot switch focus to the graphics window and a History\nmenu appears.  Use that to turn on recording.\n\n\nOn 6/7/07, rhelp.20.trevva@spamgourmet.com\n wrote:\n> Gudday,\n>\n> I am generating a series of lattice contourplots that are conditioned on a variable (Year) that has 27 different levels. If I try and put them all on one plot, it ends up pretty messy and you can't really read anything, so instead I have set the layout to 3x3, thus generating three pages of nine plots each. The problem is that I can't display all these on screen at once, because each subsequent page overwrites the previous one. I have found in the mailing lists how to print them to separate files without any problems eg.\n>\n>      p<-contourplot(log10(x)~lat*long|Year,\n>                  data=data.tbl,\n>                  layout=c(3,3))\n>      png(file=\"Herring Distribution%02d.png\",width=800,height=800)\n>      print(p)\n>      dev.off()\n>\n> but there doesn't seem to be anything about how to output multiple pages to the screen... I suspect that I may need to use the page=... option in contourplot command, but I can't seem to make it work. Its a simple, and not particularly important problem, but it sure is bugging me!\n>\n> Thanks for the advice in advance.\n>\n> Cheers,\n>\n> Mark\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
