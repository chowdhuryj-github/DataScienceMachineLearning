So far it looks very interesting\nand promising to me. But it seems i'm too stupid to understand how\nGtkTreeView is working. \nCan someone provide me an easy to understand example or point me to some\nhowto? I've read a few c- and python howtos, none of them helped me\n(well, i'm fairly new to perl and that's the first programming language i\nreally try to get into). http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/doc/pod/Gtk2/\nhelped my a lot with other stuff, but just confuses me with TreeView.\n\nthanks\n\ntannhauser \n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
