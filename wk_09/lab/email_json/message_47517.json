It's also annoying to\nread a thread, when several posters , through no fault of their own,\nget \"scrubbed\".\n\nI always think of an e-mail as pure ASCII text, unless you add an attachment.\nIs it possible that some e-mail hosts ( I use gmail ) embed binary\ncode into the e-mail?\nMaybe the R mailing list software is reacting to that.\n\n**************************\n\nOn another note, I tryed posting on gmane, to add to the thread from\nlast week. It just disappeared , or maybe not, I don't know. Maybe\nit's related to the one-time registration requirement for gmane.\n\n*************************\n\nAs far as I can tell, the above problem (scrubbing) does not occur\nwhen you do a stand-alone post, not as a response to an ongoing\nthread. Hope it stays that way!\n\n\n**************************\nHave a nice day.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
