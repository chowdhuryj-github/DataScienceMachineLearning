It deinstalls all packages related to SD, \nso that I've to reinstall the whole Sd system, included libraries.\nSo I decided to build SD from the source.\nI've libspeechd2 and libspeech-dev installed, but I think they came with SD \n0.6.1.\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
