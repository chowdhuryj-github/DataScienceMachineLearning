If not, the\nstructural equation is underidentified, which will produce the error that\nyou've encountered.\n\nI hope this helps,\n John\n\n--------------------------------\nJohn Fox\nDepartment of Sociology\nMcMaster University\nHamilton, Ontario\nCanada L8S 4M4\n905-525-9140x23604\nhttp://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox \n-------------------------------- \n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of \n> adschai@optonline.net\n> Sent: Sunday, April 08, 2007 11:07 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] Dealing with large nominal predictor in sem package\n> \n> Hi,\n> \n> I am using tsls function from sem package to estimate a model \n> which includes large number of data.
