It was\nraised by Norbert Bollow in\nhttps://your.trash.net/pipermail/siug-discuss/2007-June/003793.html .\n\nI.e. the code you get for a \"general\" license (without registering the\nwork) puts the \"dc\" metadata about the type of license in a \nelement, which the W3C code validator http://validator.w3.org/ doesn't\naccept. Whereas if you register a work under a license, the metadata\n(which also include author, right holder, title, description ecc) are\nin a  element, which the W3C code validator accepts.\n\nSure, one goal  is that search engines should be able to read the\nmetadata, and they obviously can with the  solution too. But why\nthe difference? Why doesn't the code for a \"general\" license put the\nmetadata in a  element too, if this what the W3C standards\napparently require?\n\nIt's not just a matter of being able to put a\nhttp://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10 button on a site - but valid\ncode makes general access possible.\n\nBest\n\nClaude Almansi\nCH-6532 Castione\nSwitzerland\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
