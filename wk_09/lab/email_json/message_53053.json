Consider the Phalanx project for instance: they got a\nlot of people working to improve a lot of modules, and almost none of\nthat work actually made it into the modules.\n\nThe next biggest barrier is the size of the job. Who's going to go\nthrough all that documentation on CPAN and tag everything? I wouldn't\neven want to do it on all of my modules.\n\nThere isn't a technical problem, but there is a huge social and\npragmatic problem. It would be very nice if the documentation had a\nnatural way to do this without extra-documentation clues from third\nparties.\n\n"}
