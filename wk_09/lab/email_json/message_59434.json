New York City is considering\n[0]requiring a permit for photographers, film-makers, and even possibly\ntourists who want to shoot imagery in the Big Apple. \"New rules being\nconsidered by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting would\nrequire any group of two or more people who want to use a camera in a\nsingle public location for more than a half hour to get a city permit and\ninsurance. The same requirements would apply to any group of five or more\npeople who plan to use a tripod in a public location for more than 10\nminutes, including the time it takes to set up the equipment. Julianne\nCho, assistant commissioner of the film office, said the rules were not\nintended to apply to families on vacation or amateur filmmakers or\nphotographers. Nevertheless, the New York Civil Liberties Union says the\nproposed rules, as strictly interpreted, could have that effect. The\ngroup also warns that the rules set the stage for selective and perhaps\ndiscriminatory enforcement by police.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/30/0644201\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/nyregion/29camera.html?ei=5090&en=71135caff6fefe6a&ex=1340769600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=print\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Apple iPhone Dissected                                             |\n|   from the better-them-than-you dept.                              |\n|   posted by CowboyNeal on Saturday June 30, @08:27 (Handhelds)     |\n|   http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/30/122204      |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nConch writes \"Only hours after the launch, the Apple [0]iPhone has been\ndissected.
