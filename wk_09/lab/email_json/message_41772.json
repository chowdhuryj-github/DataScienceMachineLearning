And how the hell are you\ngoing to justify adding an invariant section to Wikipedia since the\nbreadth of its content is all of human knowledge and invariant\nsections can only deal with subject matter that is not related to the\nmain subject of a GFDLed doc?\n\nI have yet to see a practical example of a situation that actually\nhappened that justifies Debian's concerns against the GFDL. In the\nmeantime, \"man gcc\" still says here that gcc has no manpage, contrary\nto Debian policy.\n\n- Jordi G.
