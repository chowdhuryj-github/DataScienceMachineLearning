I am not sure how to define \"accompany\" in a way that\nexcludes that.  In addition, Debian Bacula packages are marked to work\nwith the specific OpenSSL package at the same place (although others\nare compatible).  GPL section 3 provides three options to someone who\nwishes to distribute executable binary versions of GPLed works:\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n3(c) is not available to Debian.  3(b) is prohibitively expensive.\nThat leaves 3(a), with this clarification at the end of section 3:\n\n  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\nThis seems to say that \"offering equivalent access to copy [] from the\nsame place\" is one way to \"accompany\", at least in the sense used by\nsection 3 of the GPL.\n\n> By the way, just to be clear, I consider all this (not you guys but these \n> license difficulties) to be a real pain.

I certainly do; it has pushed me to make sure that my\n(small amount of) encryption-using code can use either OpenSSL or\nGnuTLS's OpenSSL compatibility mode.\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
