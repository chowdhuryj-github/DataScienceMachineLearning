I checked the\nEmail::MIME::Attachment::Stripper which needs to be initialized with\nEmail::MIME object. I checked the Email::MIME module but I couldn't\nunderstand how to read mail and create new Email::MIME object.\n\nBasically I need code for reading mail with Mail::POP3Client module\nthen create Email::MIME object and then pass it to\nEmail::MIME::Attachment::Stripper. Or is there better way to receive\nmail and save attachment?\n\nThank you all.\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
