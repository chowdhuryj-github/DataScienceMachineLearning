Not if you use the standard R function  load()!\n\nNothing is \"erased\".  If you load objects for which you have\nobjects in the same name in your workspace, then and only then,\nthose in the workspace will be replaced by the newly loaded\nones.\n\nFor that reason,\n\n   attach(\"some_file.rda\")\n\nis sometimes preferred.\nBut, as Uwe Ligges has already said:\nWorking with .Rdata files is not recommended: You should work\nwith script files (\"foo.R\"), source() and possibly even own packages\nand only save() {and load()/attach()} things that are expensive to rebuild.\nAnd for those, I strongly recommend to use a filename different\nfrom \".Rdata\".\n\nMartin Maechler, ETH Zurich\n\n    Petr> Petr\n\n\n    Petr> Walter Paczkowski napsal(a):\n    >> Good morning,\n    >> \n    >> I keep copies my .RData file in different directories for different projects on Windows XP.
