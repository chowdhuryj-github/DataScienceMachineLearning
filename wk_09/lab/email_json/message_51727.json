The blanket was repaired during a spacewalk, but because engineers underestimated how hot the underlying structure got during the climb to space, Shannon ordered a final discussion to make sure no one had any concerns.\n\nThe evening meeting lasted less than two hours. A NASA spokesman said engineers do, in fact, believe the debris seen after undocking was close to the shuttle and, as a result, small and no threat to the orbiter. As for the rocket pod analysis, the MMT concluded the graphite-epoxy material making up the left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod is not in any danger of over heating, thanks in part to the repair job carried out during a spacewalk last Friday.\n\nFinally, the MMT concluded the protruding gap filler thread will not cause any problems during entry. The spokesman said the decision to proceed with entry, weather permitting, was unanimous.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
