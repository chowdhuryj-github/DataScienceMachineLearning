You should investigate using a \nlist and setting a member of it, e.g.\n\nasdf$y <- value\n\nor\n\nf <- function(value) list(y=value)\nasdf <- f(value)\n\ndepending on what you are trying to do.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
