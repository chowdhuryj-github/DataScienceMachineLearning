Thank you.\n\nIf you just want the integer part (aka floor) then use the int function.\n\nmy $n = 1.23;\nmy $i = int $n;\n\nIf you want to round to the nearest integer add 0.5 to it before using int.\n\nmy $m = 1.77;\nmy $n = 1.23;\nmy $i = int($m+0.5);\nmy $j = int($n+0.5);\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
