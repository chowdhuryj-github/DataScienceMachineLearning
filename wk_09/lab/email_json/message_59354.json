Perhaps not.  We would need to see numbers of both\na client implementation and a server implementation.  And you\nneed to be able to prove that a server with X number of\nauthentication requests per second works now and does not work\nwith this patch.  But even then, you can simply disable the\nrequest with a setting in /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf\nif necessary.   So for now, this debate point is purely speculative\nand no reason to deny functionality.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGhwFzIR7qMdg1EfYRAqiBAKCceQlS7gCkzbHemKCaet1cbIJcdwCg7BJf\nH7IqA0ATJHCBmttRuSLFpx0=\n=pQg6\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
