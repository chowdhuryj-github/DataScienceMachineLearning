Is\n  the list always the same?\n\n- Why are you using references? Are you sure you need to?\n\n- modify_variable() doesn't appear to modify anything, otherwise why are\n  you assigning its return value to the scalar passed as a parameter? It\n  seems to be just a function.\n\n\n>From what I can see, you need no more than:\n\n  $_ = function($_) foreach ($var1, $var2, $var3);\n\nWill this do? Or is there more to the problem than you've explained?\n\nRob\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
