If you are new to programming with R, please read\nthe \"Introduction to R\" at\n\n   http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html\n\nThis will answer most of the basic questions, but it requires more time\nthan typing out an email.\n\nIf you still have questions, please \n\n  1. Read the posting guide when writing your message. \n\n  2. Provide a specific question rather than asking us to do the work\nfor you. What part of this are you stuck on?\n\nWe are happy to *help*, but you will have to do more. What you need is\nprobably a few lines of code, but we try to encourage people to think\nabout the solution a bit so that they don't email the list with every\nquestion that they have. \n\nThanks,\n\nMax\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Blew, Ted\n> Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2007 2:44 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] sd with n not n-1\n> \n> need a version of sd [or var] to return population standard deviation\n> (using n rather than n-1 denominator) that will operate on a dataframe\n> containing missings, i.e. unequal n's. any ideas? thx, ted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nLEGAL NOTICE\\ Unless expressly stated otherwise, this messag...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
