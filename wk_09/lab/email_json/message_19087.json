The documentation states that it is not possible to mix and match Hershey fonts with plotmath symbols. My *ideal* scenario would be to write the \nperpendicular symbol as a subscript (specifically, I would like to have \" \\epsilon_{\\perp} \" as an axis label).\n\nI have searched the help archive, and it turned up the following post from 2002:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2m8n9c\n\nwhich explains a way of \"faking\" subscripts when using the Hershey fonts, though it does have several drawbacks. Have things moved on in the last five years, or is this still the best \nknown solution?\n\nMany thanks for your help,\n\n\n-Matt\n\n\n\nOn Sat Apr 28 17:35 , 'Gabor Grothendieck'  sent:\n\n>Its available in the Hershey fonts:\n>\n>plot(0, 0, type = \"n\")\n>text(0, 0, \"A \\\\pp B\", vfont = c(\"serif\", \"plain\"))\n>\n>\n>On 4/28/07, Matthew Neilson matt@gneilson.plus.com> wrote:\n>> Hey,\n>>\n>> Does anyone know of an equivalent to the LaTeX \\perp (perpendicular)\n>> symbol for adding to R plots?
