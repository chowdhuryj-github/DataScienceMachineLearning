It  \noriginated at baens bar (http://www.baen.com)\n\nwith folks complaining they couldn't find one that they liked.\nWell, they've found one, and it'll be running linux.  I've inserted  \ninto the discussions that speakup on an ebook reader would be an  \nexcellent thing.\nThey agree.\nTest units aren't out yet, but once they arrive, we're going to work  \nto try to get speakup working on them.\nFinal selling price is supposed to be around $350.\nThey'll  read ebooks, play mp3 files, and run basic linux software,  \nwhich means you can install pretty much anything you like on them.\nThere's already talk about turning them into pda-type devices in  \naddition to an ebook reader.\nPerhaps that'll meet your needs.\nOnce it's out, 350 bucks will get *anyone* a pda that *can* talk if  \nso desired.\nCan't beat that.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
