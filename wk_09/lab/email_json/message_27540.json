The confrontations are the latest indications of an\nintensifying rift between Bush and congressional Republicans. Reps. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.)\nattracted the ire of White House officials for allegedly speaking to reporters about a Tuesday meeting between Bush and\ncentrist Republicans on the Iraq war. Details of the contentious meeting first emerged Wednesday evening and attracted\nPage 1 headlines yesterday. Sources said that Dan Meyer, Bush's liaison to the House, confronted LaHood while White\nHouse political strategist Karl Rove rebuked Kirk.

Gonzales yesterday during intense questioning by Democrats, even as revelations emerged about\nattempts to fire U.S. attorneys singled out for criticism by White House political adviser Karl Rove. Appearing more\nconfident as he has kept his job and the support of President Bush, Gonzales rebuffed questions by Democrats on the\nHouse Judiciary Committee about the firings of eight U.S. attorneys and repeated his defense of the dismissals as\nwarranted, if poorly handled. Gonzales asserted that the January 2006 removal of a U.S. attorney in Kansas City, Mo.,\nrevealed in media reports yesterday was not part of the same process that led to the firings of the other prosecutors.\nWashington Post: House GOP Stands Behind Gonzales\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051000109.html\n\nWOLFOWITZ GETS MORE SUPPORT FROM PAULSON: U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson renewed his praise for Paul Wolfowitz\nas the World Bank president put the final touches on his defense against conflict- of-interest charges. \"He is a\ndedicated and committed public servant,\" Paulson said in an interview yesterday in Washington. \"I very much admire what\nhe has done at the World Bank in terms of fighting poverty.\" Wolfowitz, 63, has until late today to respond to findings\nby a panel of World Bank directors that his involvement in a pay-and-promotion package for his companion broke bank\nrules. The committee will then send its report and his response to the full 24-member board, which will meet next week\nto determine his fate.

The unusual agreement, which came after\nweeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in\ntrading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books\nand comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it\nalso represented a shrewd compromise by the White House.

U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler placed a temporary restraining order on Palfrey and her civil\nattorney, prohibiting them from sharing additional phone records with news organizations or the public. Palfrey and her\nattorney had prompted -- critics said encouraged -- speculation in the past few months about who might be publicly\nidentified as a client after they turned over a sizable portion of her business phone records to the ABC News program\n\"20/20.\" Washington Post: Judge Orders Lid On Phone Records\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051001450.html\n\nMOORE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR CUBA TRIP: The feds are probing whether Bush-bashing filmmaker Michael Moore violated U.S.\nlaw when he brought ailing 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for a segment in his latest movie. The Treasury Department's\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control told Moore last week that he was being investigated for possible violations of the\nU.S. trade embargo restricting travel to Cuba. In February, the Oscar-winning director took a group of ailing Ground\nZero workers to the communist country for medical treatment as part of his new film, \"Sicko,\" a documentary exploring\nthe woes of America's health-care system. Although Moore had applied in October for permission to travel to Cuba, no\ndetermination had been made about the request, according to officials.

Colleges and universities in Ohio,\nWashington state, Connecticut, Mississippi and elsewhere also are vying for the opportunity to host a debate. The\nnonpartisan commission plans to announce its four sites in October. No dates have been set for the debates. AP via\nYahoo!

She never aspired to be a stay-at-home wife or mother. For years she wrestled with the issues that many\nprofessional women with families face, chiefly whether to quit her job. Now, that is what Obama, 43, has decided to do.\nAnd though she will hardly be homebound, she admits to being conflicted. \"It is very odd,\" she said of the prospect of\ninterrupting her career, during one of her first one-on-one interviews since her husband, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.),\nannounced he is running for president.

Hillary Rodham Clinton's\npresidential campaign hasn't used its political machine to solicit endorsements from key rank-and-file elected\nDemocrats in early primary states. Most black Democrats are still uncommitted in their party's 2008 presidential race,\nbut several officials say they are impressed with the aggressive outreach of Sen. Barack Obama's campaign. Without a\nmatching response from Mrs. Clinton, many said the New York Democrat could be facing a \"groundswell\" of support for Mr.\nObama, Illinois Democrat, by this summer. \"If that occurs, Obama will sweep up a lot of people who would normally be\nwith the Clintons,\" said Georgia state Rep. Al Williams, chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.

The former mayor has been ahead of Mr. Romney and\nSenator McCain of Arizona for months, but polls in the last two weeks have the former Massachusetts governor gaining or\nleading in New Hampshire, the site of the first primary, and in Michigan. Though Mr. Romney remains far behind Mr.\nGiuliani in national surveys, the bump in the Granite State is a sign his campaign may be catching on with Republican\nprimary voters. New York Sun: Romney Surges in Polls http://www.nysun.com/article/54251\n\nTIME COVER STORY: WHAT DOES ROMNEY \"REALLY BELIEVE\": John F. Kennedy's election in 1960 was supposed to have laid the\n\"religious question\" to rest, yet it arises again with a fury. What does the Constitution mean when it says there\nshould be no religion test for office? It plainly means that a candidate can't be barred from running because he or she\nhappens to be a Quaker or a Buddhist or a Pentecostal. But Mitt Romney's candidacy raises a broader issue: Is the\nsubstance of private beliefs off-limits? You can ask if a candidate believes in school vouchers and vote for someone\nelse if you disagree with the answer. But can you ask if he believes that the Garden of Eden was located in Jackson\nCounty, Mo., as the Mormon founder taught, and vote against him on the grounds of that answer? Or, for that matter,\nbecause of the kind of underwear he wears?

Edwards is\nquick to acknowledge his spending on health care, energy and poverty reduction comes at a cost, with more plans to\ncome. All told, his proposals would equal more than $1 trillion if he could get them enacted into law and operational\nduring two White House terms. To put the number in perspective, President Bush has dedicated more than $1.8 trillion to\ntax cuts. The cost of the Iraq war is nearing $450 billion. And this year's federal budget is about $2.8 trillion. AP\nvia Yahoo!

Chris Dodd has raised\nfor his presidential bid this year comes from the industries he regulates as chairman of the Senate banking committee,\na USA TODAY analysis of data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. The Democrat has consistently polled\nin the single digits in the presidential campaign. The donations, coupled with contributions from the same industries\nto his Senate re-election coffers, show how a key sector with business before Dodd's panel hedges its bets. The Senate\nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs holds sway on issues such as regulating mortgage-lending companies\ndealing with foreclosures and providing a federal financial security net to insurance companies in the event of\nterrorist attacks.
