You need\nto create a model ( in Perl ), and create some treeview columns ( in\nPerl ), and append the columns to the treeview, and then connect the\nmodel to the treeview.\n\nI have some examples of setting up different kinds of columns\n( including some custom renderers ) in my project,\nGtk2::Ex::datasheet::DBI, which you can find at:\nhttp://entropy.homelinux.org/axis\n\nDan\n\n--\nDaniel Kasak\nIT Developer\nNUS Consulting Group\nLevel 5, 77 Pacific Highway\nNorth Sydney, NSW, Australia 2060\nT: (+61) 2 9922-7676 / F: (+61) 2 9922 7989\nemail: dkasak@nusconsulting.com.au\nwebsite: http://www.nusconsulting.com.au\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
