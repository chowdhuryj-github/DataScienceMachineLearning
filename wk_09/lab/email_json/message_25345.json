If I use apply (a,2,min) I will get a vector of\nzeros as the minimum but what I want it for example from column 1 I\nshould get 1 i.e for all the matrix I should get a vector (1,2,3,3). I\nwonder if someone can give an idea on how to go about it.\n\nthanks in advance for your help.\n\nOarabile\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
