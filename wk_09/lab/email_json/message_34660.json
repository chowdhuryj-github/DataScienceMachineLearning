I.E. /usr/bin/more  \ninstead of just more.\nThis prevents hackers from overriding the programs being executed.\nAlso, when you put it in a cron job, the output of the job will be  \nemailed to root (unless you specify otherwise) so you'll know if it  \nworked or not.\nBut, most programs (and I'm sure appget is amoung them) have an error  \ncode to determine if they exited successfully or not.\nSimply test for the code after the program ends if you really need to  \nknow, but it shouldn't matter, since you can view the output of the  \njob if so desired.\n\n\nOn May 22, 2007, at 8:53 PM, Scott Berry wrote:\n\n> Hello guys and gals,\n>\n> One more question here.
