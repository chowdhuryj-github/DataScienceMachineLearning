Since\nbitstormlite is licensed under GPL with no exceptions, I believe there\nis an license incompatibility and the binary package is undistributable\nas is.\n\nMaybe just building depend on libcurl4-gnutls-dev and therefore linking\nto libcurl4-gnutls will solve the problem, but I didn't test.  In any\ncase, libcurl3-dev is no longer a real package and shouldn't be used as\nbuild dependency.\n\nThis is the first time I report a bug about licensing issue, and I am\nnot sure I am understanding everything correctly.  Therefore I am cc:ing\ndebian-legal list for confirmation.\n\nMing\n2007.05.31\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
