The information is stored\nin the variable data. If I use the command \"length(data)\" I get back a\nnumber which corresponds to the number of variables which were imported.\nHere it is 82. Now I only want to know the names of the imported\nvariables to modify my program. Can anyone help me?\n\nMy knowledge which I tested yet to archive the goal:\n\n1. I know that I can extract the information of a variable with the\ncommand \"data$staine\" for example. Here I need to know the variable name\n\"staine\" coming from Matlab. But what if I do not know it?\n\n2. The command \"data[10]\" just gives me back the information stored in\nthe variable no. 10  but I do not know the name.\n\n3. I am not allowed to make changes in the Matlab code because it just a\nlizenced program so I need to do it in R. In Matlab I just need to add\nthe code line \"names=evalin('base','who')\" and than store the workspace.\nI could use the variable name in and extract the names with data$names.\n\n\nHas anyone an idea?\n\nThanks, Corinna\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
