There's no reason this should\nbe any different for 64-bit hosts, but we probably are lucking out on other\nfields here as well.  The \"fields_present\" field shouldn't just be copied\nfrom usrmgr traces, because it indicates which fields should be set, and\nin this case, we were setting the kickoff time (NOT the expired time) to some\nrandom date.\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/torture/rpc/samba3rpc.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nModified: branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/torture/rpc/samba3rpc.c\n===================================================================\n--- branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/torture/rpc/samba3rpc.c\t2007-05-29 20:12:48 UTC (rev 23230)\n+++ branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/torture/rpc/samba3rpc.c\t2007-05-29 21:50:17 UTC (rev 23231)\n@@ -582,6 +582,7 @@\n \t\tqui.out.info->info21.force_password_change = 0;\n \t\tqui.out.info->info21.account_name.string = NULL;\n \t\tqui.out.info->info21.rid = 0;\n+\t\tqui.out.info->info21.acct_expiry = 0;\n \t\tqui.out.info->info21.fields_present = 0x81827fa; /* copy usrmgr.exe */\n \n \t\tu_info.info21 = qui.out.info->info21;\n\n"}
