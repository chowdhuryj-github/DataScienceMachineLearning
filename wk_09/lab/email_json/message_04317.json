Then I guess it needs some experimentation as it works fine on my\nWindows system.\n\nI was hoping it was OK everywhere as it's not ambiguous (only fseek on a terminal\ndevice seems unlikely) and as far as I know the C ftell() function is fine on\nSTDOUT, or maybe that's platform-dependent too.\n\nRob\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
