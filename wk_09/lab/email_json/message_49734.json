If you have emacs installed you'll \nprobably find that ctags is actually a simlink to ctags-emacs-21 or \nsimilar.  We should probably detect which version of ctags people have \nas part of parrot configuration and then use the one which corresponds \nto exuberant-ctags.\n\nWhat configurations do people on the list have?  My system is Gentoo \nLinux and I have the ctags package installed which provides the \n'exuberant-ctags' program.  The emacs installation gives a ctags \nsimlink to ctags-emacs-21.  Do other people have an exuberant-ctags \npackage installed on their system and it actually installs a 'ctags' \nbinary?  Or are they all 'exuberant-ctags'?  The reason I'm interested \nis because we might be able to make a small change to the makefile \nrather than the extra work of a new configure step.\n\nComments most definitely welcome.\n\nPaul\n\n"}
