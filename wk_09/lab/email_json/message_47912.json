What's your experience of gangs and gun crime? Is it confined to one ethnic group? Let us know via our website.\n\n\nAlso, tell us what subjects you'd like to see us tackling as part of our \"Broken Society\" series.  \n\n\nTo comment, and to watch tonight's report online, click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
