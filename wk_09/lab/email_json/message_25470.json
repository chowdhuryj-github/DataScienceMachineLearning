I agree that more \ninformative error messages and 'traceback' would be nice, but I've found \nthe 'debug' facility quite useful.  [I even sometimes prepare a shell of \na function 'fn', then say debug(fn) and fn(), and complete writing the \nfunction in its native environment where I can more easily check what \neach step does.]  I've heard that 'debug' does not work will with S4 \nclass generics, but I have not so far had to deal with that.  {There is \nalso a 'debug' package, which is completely separate from the debug \ncommand in the 'base' package.  I've heard that it has more extensive \ncapabilities, but I've never used it.}\n\n      I suspect you may already know 'debug', but for those who don't, I \nthink it's worth noting its utility for this kind of thing. \n\n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n\nTony Plate wrote:\n> Certain errors seem to generate messages that are less informative than \n> most -- they just tell you which function an error happened in, but \n> don't indicate which line or expression the error occurred in.\n>\n> Here's a toy example:\n>\n>  > f <- function(x) {a <- 1; y <- x[list(1:3)]; b <- 2; return(y)}\n>  > options(error=NULL)\n>  > f(1:3)\n> Error in f(1:3) : invalid subscript type\n>  > traceback()\n> 1: f(1:3)\n>  >\n>\n> In this function, it's clear that the error is in subscripting 'x', but \n> it's not always so immediately obvious in lengthier functions.\n>\n> Is there anything I can do to get a more informative error message in \n> this type of situation?
