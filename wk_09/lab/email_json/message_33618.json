If you mean  \nthat you want to know what the row names are, then an answer is:\n\ndf <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(3), x2 = rnorm(3))\nnames(df) # just to show that I gave the columns names while defining df\nrownames(df)\n\nIf you mean that you want to assign names to the rows, then\n\ndf <- data.frame(rnorm(3), rnorm(3))\nnames(df) <- c('y1', 'y2') # not required\nrownames(df) <- c('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nIn one commandt:\n\ndf <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(3), x2 = rnorm(3), row.names = c('a',  \n'b', 'c'))\n\nMore detailed:\n\ndf <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(3), x2 = rnorm(3), row.names = c('a',  \n'b', 'c'), check.rows = TRUE, check.names = TRUE)\n\n****\nMore importantly you could have found all this out by typing ?data.frame\n****\n\nI have seen several posts from you that seem to be rather elementary  \nquestions, sometimes not using the correct terminology ('write down'  \nand 'lines of a data frame' are not standard). Have you taken the  \ntime to go through any of the many introductions to R available on line?\n\nAlso, you're not asking your questions well (this comment is not  \nabout knowing English well):\nYou would have been better off asking:\n\"I have a data frame\ndf <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(3), x2 = rnorm(3))\nHow do I ....? \"\n_____________________________\nProfessor Michael Kubovy\nUniversity of Virginia\nDepartment of Psychology\nUSPS:     P.O.Box 400400    Charlottesville, VA 22904-4400\nParcels:    Room 102        Gilmer Hall\n         McCormick Road    Charlottesville, VA 22903\nOffice:    B011    +1-434-982-4729\nLab:        B019    +1-434-982-4751\nFax:        +1-434-982-4766\nWWW:    http://www.people.virginia.edu/~mk9y/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
