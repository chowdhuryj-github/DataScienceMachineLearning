Among its predictors, it has a nominal data which has about 10 possible values. So I expand this parameter into 9-binary-value predictors with the coefficient of base value equals 0. I also have another continuous predictor. \n\nThe problem is that, whenever I run the tsls, I will get 'System is computationally singular' error all the time. I'm wondering if there is anyway that I can overcome this problem? Please kindly suggest. Thank you so much in advance.\n\n- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
