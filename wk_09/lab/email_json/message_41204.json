In R, you will get the most happiness\nfrom\n?leverage.plot\nin the car package.\n\nmahalanobois D^2 are proportional to leverage.\n\n-Michael\n\n\ngatemaze@gmail.com wrote:\n> Hi, I am not sure I am using correctly the mahalanobis distnace method...\n> Suppose I have a response variable Y and predictor variables X1 and X2\n> \n> all <- cbind(Y, X1, X2)\n> mahalanobis(all, colMeans(all), cov(all));\n> \n> However, my results from this are different from the ones I am getting\n> using another statistical software.\n> \n> I was reading that the comparison is with the means of the predictor\n> variables which led me to think that the above should be transformed\n> into:\n> \n> predictors <- cbind(X1, X2)\n> mahalanobis(all, colMeans(predictors), cov(all))\n> \n> But still the results are different....\n> \n> Am I doing something wrong or have I misunderstood something in the\n> use of the function mahalanobis?
