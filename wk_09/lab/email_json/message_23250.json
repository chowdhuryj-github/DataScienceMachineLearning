Look for tests that use torture_open_connection() with a 2nd\nargument other than 0. You then supply a list of targets with --unclist\n\nThe main tests I use that do this are:\n\n RAW-BENCH-OPEN\n RAW-BENCH-LOCK\n RAW-NOTIFY\n BENCH-NBENCH\n RAW-OPEN\n \nWe should expand the range of tests that do this.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
