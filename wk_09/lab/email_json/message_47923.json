Long\nago Gower (1966) drew attention to the links between PCA and classical\nscaling.  It took me a few seconds to find this:\n\nhttp://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980JJ08200001.pdf\n\nOf course, I knew about Gower.  But I knew about Gower because I had done\nthe _basic_ research on these methods.  And that was my point.  In a later\npaper Gower argued that classical scaling extended, and was more powerful\nthan, PCA.\n\nHowever, classical scaling operates on [a matrix of] similarities between\nobservations/individuals/rows, whereas PCA operates on [a matrix of]\nsimilarities between variables/descriptors/columns.  This means that in\nclassical scaling the axes cannot be interpreted; often one does  a PCA to\nget at these.\n\nHTH, bestR,\nMark.\n\n\nmichael watson (IAH-C) wrote:\n> \n> Hi Mark\n> \n> I think Brian Ripley answered this most effectively and succinctly.
