(My intervals are [0,183], \n[184,365], [366,548], [549,730], [730,Inf]). I looked in the \nsearchable archives and found that others had also discovered \nproblems with survSplit() and suggested Lexis() in the Epi package.\n\nWhen I try to get Lexis to work, I get an error message that I cannot \ninterpret:\n\n > \naddictscdf<-Lexis(entry=start,exit=stop,fail='status',breaks=c(184,366,549,730),\n+   include=c('id','clinic','prison','meth','clinic01'),data=addicts)\n\n         The following object(s) are masked from addicts :\n\n          clinic id meth prison status survtime\n\nError: object is not subsettable\n\n\nI'm sure I'm making some type of trivial error here, but I don't know \nhow to find it. I would guess that it has something to do with \n'start' and 'stop', of which arguments I am apparently clueless as to \nthe meaning.\n================================================================\nRobert A.
