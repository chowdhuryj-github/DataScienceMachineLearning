I was \njust wondering, what's the best directory service to run these days? I \nhad to take an intro to Unix class for school, and that mentioned NIS, \nwhich I had looked into in the past...though I just read the ORielly \nbook on that and it seemed to say that NIS should only be used until \nnewer alternatives became stable, and the book was about 5 years old.  \nBeing able to interoperate with windows hosts would be nice also, though \nI'm not holding my breath...\nAny help would be apreciated.\n\n-- \nquit   When the quit statement is read, the  bc  processor\n       is  terminated, regardless of where the quit state-\n       ment is found.  For example, \"if  (0  ==  1)  quit\"\n       will cause bc to terminate.\n\t-- seen in the manpage for \"bc\". Note the \"if\" statement's logic\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
