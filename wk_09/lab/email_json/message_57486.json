It looks like you can now \"click\"on the trackpad which I believe is the reason of the behavior. Might\nwant to tweak the trackpad sensitivity.* We can easily tweak mouse speed. I can work on it with Eben (I assumehe is the right person to look into this).* The key related issues blocks on #663* Power button not shutting down the system is indeed the wanted behavior.\n* The icon in Read is actually a Save icon. I added a tooltip but theconfusion might mean the icon is not quite intuitive.* Your problems opening activities might be related to a journal bugwhich is now fixed. Let's test again on the next image.\nMarco\n"}
