I am new to R and I can't figure out how you can assess the success rates of predictions.\n\nAny help and examples would be much appreciated.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nNathaniel Grey\nResearch Associate\nWolfson Research Associate\nUniversity of Durham\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
