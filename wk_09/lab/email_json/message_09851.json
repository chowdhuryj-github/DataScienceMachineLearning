It appears that you have correlated pairs of observations and you want to find if the correlation between the pairs are significant. I guess you can use a linear model of one array index observation against the other with autocorrelated errors for each pair of your data below. \n\n\n> How can I view the function cor.test's code?

It is in \n\n/usr/local/maitra/Desktop/R-2.4.0/src/library/stats/R/cor.test.R\n\ndepending on which .tgz file you downloaded: I have an old one (R-2.4.0) sitting on this computer (not binary).\n\nNote that even if you assume each of your (31, 31) grid to be independent, you will run into the problem of multiple testing, for which you can use false discovery rate methods. However, your (31, 31) grid may not be close to independent. \n\nHTH,\nBest wishes,\nRanjan\n\n\n> \n> I would gratefully appreciate any help you can offer me on these two interlinked \n> issues,\n> \n> Many thanks for your time and consideration,\n> \n> Jenny\n> \n> PS.
