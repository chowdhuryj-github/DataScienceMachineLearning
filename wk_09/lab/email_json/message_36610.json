THis is on a machine running linux freespire. During the update process it did issue a warning saying I should check that I had \"xserver-xorg\" and \"xorg\" installed. I tried to do this but running \"apt-cache search xserver\" came up with a huge list of packages, and the computer seemed to be running fine; so I left it. \n\nHowever next time I booted up, it can't start the xserver  and I don't seem to be online. Can any one suggest what I need to do?\n\nTHanks very much\n\n\nSimon Bond. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________ \n \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
