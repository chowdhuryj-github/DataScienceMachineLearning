The\nDebian Windows installer from goodbye-windows.com (or perhaps\ngoodbye-microsoft.com) comes to mind as such an example.\n\nI realise it probably doesn't make much of a difference if the GPL is\nin a clickthrough, since as I understand it, you don't need to agree\nto the GPL to use the software, and clickthrough agreements are\nprobably almost always impossible to enforce. So, just out of academic\ncuriousity, what's the status of putting the GPL in such a\nclickthrough agreement? Does it make any difference or not?\n\n- Jordi G.
