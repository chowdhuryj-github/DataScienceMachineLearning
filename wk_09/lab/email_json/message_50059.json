The output of 'perl -le\"print for @ARGV\" *'  is * and the other is *.*. Funny though that sed *does* work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Degen\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nTake the Internet to Go: Yahoo!Go puts the Internet in your pocket: mail, news, photos & more. \nhttp://mobile.yahoo.com/go?refer=1GNXIC\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
