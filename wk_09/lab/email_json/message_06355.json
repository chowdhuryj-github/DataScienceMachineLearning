I believe this is all done just as static \nHTML, and I believe the UI is just transitional, it's not intended as \nthe final implementation.  I'm not sure how that relates to \nebook-browser-reader.  Huh.\n\nAnyway, there definitely will be HTML content that should have a good \nreading experience, which implies something browser-based.  Though \nthere's been discussion of whether the browser activity in particular \nshould be the basis of that.  The line between browsing and reading \nextended works seems fuzzy to me; creating a distinction by having two \nactivities would seem unfortunate.\n\nSomething that I think would be excellent is if the browser had UI \nspecifically related to some of these link types: \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links -- these identify the \nposition of a page in a book-like structure fairly well, I think, and \nhaving the browser actually pay attention to that should make it easier \nto translating a book into HTML.\n\nI imagine better bookmarking of some sort would also be helpful -- \nideally you'd be able to save your exact position so you can return to \nit.  The journal would save that position (once the journal is \nimplemented), but regardless of that the browser has to be able to tell \nthe journal the position and then be able to return to it later.\n\n\n-- \nIan Bicking | ianb@colorstudy.com | http://blog.ianbicking.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
