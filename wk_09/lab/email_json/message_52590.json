I don't think there is a need to put\nlicenses into subfolders on the system, but that is cool to read through\ndirectories for all necessary files.\n\nHeya, can you distill your blog notes onto:\nhttp://wiki.creativecommons.org/liblicense\n\nIf you all look there, you can see some nice mockups which this connects\nwith! Get excited! Anyone interested in helping move this forward as\nwell?\n\nJon\n\n> \n-- \nJon Phillips\n\nSan Francisco, CA\nUSA PH 510.499.0894\njon@rejon.org\nhttp://www.rejon.org\n\nMSN, AIM, Yahoo Chat: kidproto\nJabber Chat: rejon@gristle.org\nIRC: rejon@irc.freenode.net\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
