One advantage of this is that you can write a few methods for\nNullCall and in many cases avoid explicit tests like:\n\n   if (class(obj) == \"NullCall\") ... else ...\n\nFor example, you could define a show metho that printed 'NULL' or\nsomething.\n\nIt is also possible to define a class union and use that as the slot\ntype.  I don't like this solution, but YMMV.\n\n+ seth\n\n-- \nSeth Falcon | Computational Biology | Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nhttp://bioconductor.org\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
