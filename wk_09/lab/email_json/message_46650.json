For example:<meta:user-defined meta:name=\"License Name\">Attribution-ShareAlike \n2.5 </meta:user-defined><meta:user-defined meta:name=\"License URL\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/</meta:user-defined>\n...I would like to append meta-data as a child element of <office:meta> element, but I think there's no easy way to do this, I'm still checking it. The ideal scenario would be if CC RDF was in ODF specification.\nI'll keep you updated, but don't delay your project, there is a lot of discussion and work to be done regarding this question yet. =)Best,CassioOn 6/11/07, \nFran\u00e7ois D\u00e9chelle <\n\nfrancois@dechelle.net\n> wrote:Hello,No, the way to add license metadata to OO.o ODF documents has not been\ndecided yet, but it has to be decided for the OO.o extension.
