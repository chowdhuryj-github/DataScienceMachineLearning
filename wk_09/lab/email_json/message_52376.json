I know these Speech-Dispatcher bugs are only present in SMP systems.\nTurning off smp support in the Linux kernel would mean obviously losing a core, but it would temporarily solve all issues I have with it crashing until a new public release is made available. What concerns me is whouldn't there be omre issues due to this at that point with compiling programs, running servers etc? Let me know.\nRegards, --Keith\nSkype: skypedude1234\n(Add me and I'll authorize you)\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
