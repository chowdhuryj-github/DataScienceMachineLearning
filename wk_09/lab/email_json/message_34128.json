I cannot use mtext\nbecause I need to use colors for the text. I tried\nlayout, but wouldn't let me include the legend, only\nplots.\n\n   I would appreciate very much some more help.\n\nRegards,\n\nJ\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Pinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
