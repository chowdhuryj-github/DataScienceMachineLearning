It's in config/gen/makefiles/root.in .\n\nI was doing \"ack HLLCompiler\" in the config directory (and other directories)\nto try to find the HLLCompiler.pbc target, but didn't realize that ack\ndoesn't search \"root.in\" by default.  I guess this is one of those\n1% cases where I should've used \"grep -r\" instead, or learned about\n\"ack -a\".\n\nPm\n\n"}
