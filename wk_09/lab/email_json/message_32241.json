I know\nhow to work around it, I'm just curious to know why such a useful option\nwas left out.\n\nI'm also interested in the logic of setting na.rm=TRUE as the default on\nmean, sd, etc. This is the opposite of the many other stat packages I\nhave used, so I assume it provides some programming benefit that is not\nobvious to me.\n\nThanks,\nBob\n\n=========================================================\n  Bob Muenchen (pronounced Min'-chen), Manager  \n  Statistical Consulting Center\n  U of TN Office of Information Technology\n  200 Stokely Management Center, Knoxville, TN 37996-0520\n  Voice: (865) 974-5230  \n  FAX:   (865) 974-4810\n  Email: muenchen@utk.edu\n  Web:   http://oit.utk.edu/scc, \n  News:  http://listserv.utk.edu/archives/statnews.html\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
