I am working on the audio libraries because there is no a same for the 4 OS (Linux/Windows/BSD/OLPC).\u00a0 However the application is working and meanwhile ill fix some minor bugs.\nThanks,-- --------------------------------Alfonso de la GuardaINVESTIGACION Y CONSULTORIA TECNOLOGICA SACTelef. 97550914\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4726906\n"}
