That way,\nyou'll be able to do whatever you want, all under native dos, on your\nphysical box, not an emulated box. Also, you can run freedos as a\nlivecd, meaning you don't need to install on to your hd in order to\nuse it.\n\nAlso, the fact that you can't use your dectalk isa card under dosemu\nisn't because linux is protective of the hardware. It is simply\nbecause dosemu as far as I know, never has, doesn't, and probably\nnever will have the support necessary to address isa/pci cards and the\nlike directly.\n\nFinally, the fact that you see different files when running dosemu as\na normal user and as root is no surprise, since in all likelihood,\nyou're running separate machines as each user. Think of it this\nway, you have 2 physical computers, pc-a, and pc-b, which both have\ndos installed. When you're running dosemu as a normal user, you're\nusing pc-a. When you're running it as root, you're using it as pc-b, a\nseparate machine from pc-a.
