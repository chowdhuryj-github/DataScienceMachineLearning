The other functions in res_lea.c (Parrot_allocate, \nParrot_reallocate, etc) have custom definitions because the behavior is \ndifferent. They satisfy the same interface with a different back-end.\n\n(That's as far as I've poked so far, finding the answer to this question \nis the next step in debugging.)\n\nAllison\n\n"}
