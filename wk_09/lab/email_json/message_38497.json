As proprietary software\ndoes not encompass the entire set of non-free software, you should not\nuse the terms interchangeably.\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nAll bad precedents began as justifiable measures.\n -- Gaius Julius Caesar in \"The Conspiracy of Catiline\" by Sallust\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
