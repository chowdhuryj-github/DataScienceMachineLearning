Basically, I\nwould like to get the variance estimation using EWMA.\n\nI am trying something like EWMA(x, lambda) and I have a couple of\nquestions:\n\n \nShould x be the returns series or price series in my case?\n\nWhen I get the result, there are the same numbers of data points as in\nthe returns series. I was expecting there would be one less data points\nthan the original data series, or are they one period lagged data?\n\nCould anyone give me some advice? Many thanks\n\n--\nView this message in context:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/EWMA-in-fMultivar-tf4018921.html#a11414114\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
