Thus, the licenses of all other\nitems are ignored and there is no intersection of permissions to be\nconsidered.\n\nLikewise, when doing something to an extracted item, you only need\nto obey its respective license. Thus, the licenses of all other\nitems are ignored and there is no sum of restrictions to be considered.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
