There are no technical problems at pad 39A and forecasters now predict an 80 percent chance of good weather at launch time.\n\n\"After many months of hard work, Atlantis is finally ready to fly,\" NASA Test Director Steve Payne told reporters today.\n\nIf all goes well, a protective gantry will be rolled away from Atlantis at 10:30 p.m. and engineers will begin pumping a half-million gallons of rocket fuel into the shuttle's external tank starting shortly after 9 a.m. Friday.\n\nCommander Rick Sturckow and his crewmates - pilot Lee Archambault, flight engineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reilly and Clay Anderson - plan to begin strapping in around 4:15 p.m. Liftoff is targeted for 7:38 p.m., roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the launch pad into the plane of the space station's orbit.\n\nThunderstorms Wednesday evening delayed work to load the shuttle's internal tanks with liquid hydrogen and oxygen to power the ship's electricity producing fuel cells. But Payne said the launch team was able to make up lost time using built-in holds in the countdown and no major problems were expected.\n\n\"We did have some significant weather in the area last night,\" said shuttle weather officer Kathy Winters. \"It did delay the ops a little bit, but generally, all the weather came together over the western portion of Melbourne and back toward the west. There was three-quarter-inch hail down in West Melbourne, but no hail here at Kennedy Space Center.\"\n\nAtlantis originally was scheduled for launch March 15, but the flight was delayed three months after a freak hail storm caused extensive damage to the top of the shuttle's external fuel tank. That damage has now been repaired and engineers say they are confident the tank's foam insulation will stand up to the thermal and aerodynamic rigors of launch without shedding any potentially dangerous debris.\n\nToday, Winters improved the launch forecast for Friday from 70 percent \"go\" to an 80 percent chance of favorable weather.\n\n\"We think it looks a little bit better,\" she said. \"Yesterday, we thought some inland thunderstorms might still be close enough to affect us, but today we're more confident they'll be more inland. So just a 20 percent chance of KSC weather prohibiting launch.\"\n\nEmergency runways in California, New Mexico, Spain and France also are expected to be available for use if needed. Should launch be delayed, the probability drops to 70 percent go on Saturday and 60 percent on Sunday.\n\nAs of this writing, flight controllers are using 7:38:02 p.m. as the estimated launch time. That may change by a few seconds based on final checks of the station's orbit and a final hold at the T-minus nine-minute mark will be adjusted as required. That said, here are countdown highlights (in EDT; fueling could begin up to a half hour earlier than the listed time):\n\nEDT...........EVENT\n\nThursday 06/07/07\n\n01:00:00 PM...Begin 13-hour 42-minute hold\n03:50:00 PM...JSC flight control team on station\n04:00:00 PM...Crew weather briefing\n05:00:00 PM...Communications system activation\n05:30:00 PM...Crew module voice checks\n06:40:00 PM...Flight crew equipment late stow\n10:30:00 PM...Rotating service structure to park position\n11:30:00 PM...Final tile, debris inspection\n\nFriday 06/08/07\n\n12:30:00 AM...Ascent switch list\n02:42:00 AM...Resume countdown\n\n02:42:00 AM...Terminate pad tours\n03:02:00 AM...Pad clear of non-essential personnel\n03:52:00 AM...Fuel cell activation\n04:42:00 AM...Booster joint heater activation\n07:27:00 AM...Fuel cell integrity checks complete\n\n07:42:00 AM...Begin 2-hour built-in hold (T-minus 6 hours)\n07:52:00 AM...Safe-and-arm system test\n08:27:00 AM...Mission management team tanking meeting\n09:12:00 AM...Test team ready for fueling\n09:42:00 AM...Resume countdown (T-minus 6 hours)\n\n09:42:00 AM...LO2, LH2 transfer line chilldown (could start earlier)\n09:52:00 AM...Main propulsion system chill down\n09:52:00 AM...LH2 slow fill\n10:00:00 AM...Astronaut wakeup\n10:22:00 AM...LO2 slow fill\n10:27:00 AM...Hydrogen ECO sensors go wet\n10:32:00 AM...LO2 fast fill\n10:42:00 AM...LH2 fast fill\n11:57:00 AM...LH2 topping\n12:37:00 PM...LH2 replenish\n12:42:00 PM...LO2 replenish\n\n12:42:00 PM...Begin 3-hour built-in hold (T-minus 3 hours)\n12:42:00 PM...Closeout crew to white room\n12:42:00 PM...External tank in stable replenish mode\n12:57:00 PM...Astronaut support personnel comm checks\n01:30:00 PM...NASA TV coverage begins\n01:45:00 PM...Astronaut photo opportunity\n03:07:00 PM...Final crew weather briefing\n03:17:00 PM...Astronauts don pressure suits\n03:42:00 PM...Resume countdown (T-minus 3 hours)\n\n03:47:00 PM...Crew departs O&C building\n04:17:00 PM...Crew ingress\n05:07:00 PM...Astronaut comm checks\n05:22:00 PM...Hatch closure\n06:07:00 PM...White room closeout\n\n06:22:00 PM...Begin 10-minute built-in hold (T-minus 20m)\n06:32:00 PM...NASA test director countdown briefing\n06:32:00 PM...Resume countdown (T-minus 20m)\n\n06:33:00 PM...Backup flight computer to OPS 1\n06:37:00 PM...KSC area clear to launch\n\n06:43:00 PM...Begin final built-in hold (T-minus 9m)\n06:54:02 PM...NTD launch status verification\n07:29:02 PM...Resume countdown (T-minus 9m)\n\n07:30:32 PM...Orbiter access arm retraction\n07:33:02 PM...Hydraulic power system (APU) start\n07:33:07 PM...Terminate LO2 replenish\n07:34:02 PM...Purge sequence 4 hydraulic test\n07:34:02 PM...Inertial measurement units to inertial\n07:34:07 PM...Aerosurface movement check\n07:34:32 PM...Main engine steering test\n07:35:07 PM...LO2 tank pressurization\n07:35:27 PM...Fuel cells to internal reactants\n07:35:32 PM...Clear caution-and-warning memory\n07:36:02 PM...Crew closes visors\n07:36:05 PM...LH2 tank pressurization\n07:37:12 PM...SRB joint heater deactivation\n07:37:31 PM...Shuttle computers take control of countdown\n07:37:41 PM...SRB steering test\n07:37:55 PM...Main engine start (T-6.6 seconds)\n07:38:02 PM...SRB ignition (LAUNCH)\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
