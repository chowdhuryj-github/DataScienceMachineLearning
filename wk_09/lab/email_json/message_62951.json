Add a struct smb_request\nthat contains some of the fields from the SMB header, removing the need\nto access inbuf directly. This right now is used only in the open file\ncode & friends, and creating that header is only done when needed. This\nneeds more work, but it is a start.\n\nJeremy, I'm only checking this into 3_0, please review before I merge it\nto _26.\n\nVolker\n\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/smb.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/printing/nt_printing.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/rpc_server/srv_srvsvc_nt.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/dir.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/nttrans.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/open.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/posix_acls.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/process.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/reply.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/trans2.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (1197 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23724\n\n"}
