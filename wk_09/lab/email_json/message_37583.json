In one amazing day with Ricky I also met his brother Matthew, his mum and his dad. It was a bit like the Osbournes, only nicer and more northern.\n\n\nWe've also been to see Dwain Chambers in Germany where he's trying to build himself a new future as an American Football player.  \n\n\nHe was banned for two years for taking performance-enhancing drugs when he was Britain's top sprinter and, he told Matthew Pinsent, he still thinks the science is way ahead of the testers when it comes to drugs.\n\n\nAll that and the chance to win tickets to Wimbledon! \n\n\nSo join me for Inside Sport at 2305 BST, BBC ONE.\n\n\n\nGabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 28 May, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and the second edition on Sunday 3 June, 1130 BST on BBC TWO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS WEEK ON BBC SPORT\n\u00a0All the TV and radio times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSIDE SPORT\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/insidesport\nMonday\n\nGabby Logan hosts the big names and stories (2305, BBC ONE) \n\nSunday\n\nAnother chance to see the show (1130, BBC TWO)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOTBALL ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/football\nFriday\n\nInternational Football, England v Brazil, first full international at the new Wembley (1930, BBC ONE and BBCi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE SPORT ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/tvandradio\nMonday\n\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 2nd Test, Headingley (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\nTuesday\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 2nd Test, Headingley (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\n\nWednesday\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\nThursday\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\nFriday\n\nHorse Racing: Epsom, including The Oaks (1330-1630, BBC TWO), Derby Day Preview (1930, BBC TWO)\nSports Extra Rugby League (1955, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online)\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\nSaturday\n\nHorse Racing: The Derby (1255-1705, BBC ONE), Derby Day highlights (2305, BBC ONE)\nRugby Sevens: Live coverage from Murrayfield (1725-1825, BBC TWO; 0900-1830, BBCi/online)\nFrench Open Tennis (1000-1900, BBCi)\nMoto GP: live coverage of the qualifying session from Mugello (1245-1400, BBCi)\nFive Live Formula One (1800, Radio Five Live)\nSunday\n\nMoto GP: Mugello (1230, BBC TWO; 1350, BBCi)\nWorld Cup Rowing (1400, BBC TWO; 1000-1100 & 1225-1500, BBCi)\nRugby league: Super League Show (1300-1355, BBC ONE North)\nAthletics: Glasgow GP (1500, BBC TWO)\nRugby Sevens: Live coverage from Murrayfield (1730, BBC TWO; 1100-1945, BBCi)\nTennis: French Open (1000-1900, BBCi) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...AND ON THE WEBSITE THIS WEEK\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/sport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe French Open on the BBC\n\u00a0When you can watch action from Roland Garros\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWatch Inside Sport\n\u00a0Download the best bits of the show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/sport_newsletter\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:sport.online@bbc.co.uk?subject=newsletter\n\nProblems with links?
