They don't overcome inertia. They don't begin.\n\nThe cross of the Legion of Honor has been conferred on me. However, few escape that distinction.\n\nOther people's opinion of you does not have to become your reality.\n\nI hate it in friends when they come too late to help.\n\nLike pilgrims to the appointed place we tend The world's an inn, and death the journey's end.\n\nAbility may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep you there.\n\nWe are the greatest power in the world. If we behave like it.\n\nReality forms around a commitment.\n\nThe truly generous is the truly wise, and he who loves not others, lives unblest.\n\nSocialism is a vast machine for churning out piles of goods marked ''Take it or leave it. ''\n\nOn an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.\n\nLove is an ocean of emotions entirely surrounded by expenses.\n\n\n"}
