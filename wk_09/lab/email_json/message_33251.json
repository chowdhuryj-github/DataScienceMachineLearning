What is to stop an artist putting a song up on ebay, \nwith a reserve if desired, winner get's the honour of giving the track to the \nworld on a BY-SA basis.\n\nOr, as above but the winner gets rights to license the work out on a non-Sa \nbasis as well. (A right shared by the author and each seperate from the \nother.)
