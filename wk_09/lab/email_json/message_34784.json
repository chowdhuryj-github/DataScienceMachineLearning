From now on, the commerce, foreign affairs and\npublic health ministries will go ahead with the CL process,\" the Nation\nnewspaper quoted Mongkol as saying on a conference call from the U.S.\ncapital.\n\nMongkol, whose ministry has declared compulsory licenses (CL) on two\nAIDS drugs and a heart disease treatment in a bid to secure lower\nprices for Thailand's poor, said his meeting with U.S. Commerce\nSecretary Carlos Gutierrez was \"totally negative.\"\n\n\"It's clear he obviously represents the drug companies. There was no\nsign of friendship left when he started talking,\" the Bangkok Post\nquoted Mongkol as saying.\n\nThe licenses, which world trade rules allow governments to issue to\nmake or buy copycat versions of drugs for public health measures,\nshocked the pharmaceutical companies who complained they received no\nprior warning.\n\nSubsequent price talks with the three drug makers -- U.S.-based Abbott\nLaboratories (ABT.N: Quote, Profile , Research) and Merck & Co Inc\n(MRK.N: Quote, Profile , Research) and Europe's Sanofi-Aventis\n(SASY.PA: Quote, Profile , Research) -- have produced no deals so far.\n\nMongkol led a delegation to Washington after it put Thailand on a\n\"priority watch list,\" citing a \"weakening of respect for patents\"\nwhich could open the Southeast Asian nation and major U.S. trading\npartner to retaliatory measures.\n\nThailand, a former AIDS hotspot, has won praise for reducing infections\nand expanding drug treatment to 100,000 of the 580,000 Thais living\nwith AIDS.\n\nBut the government says it faces budget pressures as more people need\ntreatment through the national health scheme, which covers 80 percent\nof Thailand's 63 million people.\n\nThailand has won support from health activists and former U.S.\nPresident Bill Clinton, whose foundation brokers deals with generic\ndrug makers to provide lower-priced drugs for developing nations.\n\nBut the drug industry's defenders accuse Thailand's post-coup,\nmilitary-backed government of stealing American intellectual property\nand are pressing for trade sanctions against Bangkok.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
