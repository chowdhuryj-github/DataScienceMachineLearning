Anyone care to explain the following:\n>\n> -M OPERAND Returns the age of OPERAND in days when the program started.\nsnip\n\nperl -le 'print \"$_ is \", int -M, \" days old\" for @ARGV' /etc/passwd\n/etc/passwd is 25 days old\n\n\"-M $foo\" is shorthand for \"$^T - (stat($foo))[9]\".  $^T is a special\nvariable that starts with the time the interpreter started (but it can\nbe changed) and (stat($foo))[9] is the modification time of the file.\n\nfrom perldoc perlvar\n        $^T     The time at which the program began running, in seconds since\n               the epoch (beginning of 1970).  The values returned by the -M,\n               -A, and -C filetests are based on this value.\n\nfrom perldoc -f stat\n       stat FILEHANDLE\n       stat EXPR\n       stat    Returns a 13-element list giving the status info for a file,\n               either the file opened via FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR.  If\n               EXPR is omitted, it stats $_.  Returns a null list if the stat\n               fails.  Typically used as follows:\n\n                   ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,\n                      $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)\n                          = stat($filename);\n\n               Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types.  Here are\n               the meanings of the fields:\n\n                 0 dev      device number of filesystem\n                 1 ino      inode number\n                 2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)\n                 3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file\n                 4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner\n                 5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner\n                 6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)\n                 7 size     total size of file, in bytes\n                 8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch\n                 9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch\n                10 ctime    inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)\n                11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O\n                12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated\n\n               (The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)\n\nHope that helps.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
