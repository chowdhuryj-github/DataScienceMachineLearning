Of course, I'm\nrunning an HD installation of grml, but that shouldn't make any\ndifference.\nThe `ps -e ...` part of the command line finds the process ID of your\nspeechd-up process, and this becomes the second argument to renice.\nDon't change ` to \", because this changes the semantics of\nthe command.  Text within backquotes is executed by the shell,\nand the result is substituted back into the\ncommand line.\nFor instance, \necho Today is `date`\nshould print:\nToday is Sun May 27 ...\n\nAnyway, if that command didn't work for you, just find the process ID\nof speechd-up and call renice manually.\n\nHTH,\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
