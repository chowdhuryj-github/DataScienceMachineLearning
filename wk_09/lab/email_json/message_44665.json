If anyone has is good with the gimp and can\nthink of something better then please let me know!\n\nSomething related to clustering, Samba, disks, databases etc would be\ngood. \n\nHmm, maybe we could start with the standard Samba logo and put CTDB on\nit somewhere? Maybe in the bottom right corner?\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
