It reads the line the cursor is \nplaced on, and the next line, then it stops reading. Is it possible to \nactually read the entire document at a time?\n\nAlso, is there a way to tell Speakup to make pauses at the end of sentences, \nrather than making them at the end of lines?\n\nMany thanks\n\nCleverson\n\n\"Be realistic; ask for the impossible.\" \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
