Thanks for pointing me to this!\n\nI've reviewed the public interface to libsmbclient and I don't notice\nany exceptions to the general rule of smbc_* symbols are public and\nall others are local.  The public header file defines a number of\nstructures with different names, but that'll be included by\napplications so they'll have what they need.\n\nI've never used the loader features for specifying which are public\nsymbols and which are not, but assuming it works as claimed, the patch\ncertainly gets a +1 from me.\n\nDerrell\n\n\nOn 7/2/07, Gerald (Jerry) Carter  wrote:\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> James Peach wrote:\n>\n> > I just realized why this won't work.
