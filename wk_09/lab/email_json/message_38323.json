For that you \ncan do\n\naic <- function(fit)\n   round(unname(fit$stats['Model L.R.'] - 2*fit$stats['d.f.']),2)\n\nf <- lrm( )\naic(f)\n\nIf unname doesn't exist in S-Plus as it does in R, you can remove that part.\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
