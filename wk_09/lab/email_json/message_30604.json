Hi everyone, \n      A legendary figure of the religious right has passed away. The \n      Rev. Jerry Falwell died this afternoon. The cause of death wasn\u2019t \n      immediately disclosed but he\u2019s had a history of heart trouble. In his \n      life, he was seen as a visionary to some conservatives and an archenemy to \n      liberals. Falwell leaves a legacy of founding the Moral Majority, \n      bolstering the evangelical community and sculpting it into a major \n      political force. Our Richard Schlesinger will tell the story of \n      this influential man\u2019s life. We\u2019ll also have a slate of in-depth \n      interviews with religious leaders, academics and public figures about Rev. \n      Falwell\u2019s impact on religion and politics in America. In other \n      news, the search continues for information about three U.S. soldiers \n      feared captured by an al Qaeda group during a weekend ambush in Iraq. \n      Troops have detained 11 people and questioned hundreds in connection with \n      the attack. Sharyn Alfonsi is at Fort Drum, New York, where the \n      troops killed and kidnapped last weekend were based. One of the \n      savviest ways companies are reaching kids is through the Internet.
