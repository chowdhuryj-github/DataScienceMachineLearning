A website \"contains\" an\nHTML page. The Internet \"contains\" the website.  Therefore, if a\ncopyleft license binds \"containing\" works, then a copylefted image\neither cannot be published on the Internet period, or the entire\nInternet must be relicensed!\n\nThink of Wikipedia -- is it one work, or millions?\n\nObviously, the courts won't hold that up. So is the plan to leave the\nscope up to the courts? That seems like a dangerous piece of baiting.\nThey might easily decide to set a precedent against ALL copyleft.\n\nI used to think that copyleft was intrinsically limited to what\ncopyright can cover -- and I think that's not a bad rule of thumb to\napply to what copyleft *should* be. However, the legal mechanism of\ncopyleft can apparently be used to make just about any requirement you\nwant (\"you must hop on one foot for the rest of your life or your\nlicense to this work is revoked\"). Given that this can clearly be taken\nto unreasonable extremes, where should the line be drawn?  I think it's\na very good idea for the line to be drawn by license stewards like CC\ninstead of leaving it up to lawsuits.\n\n\n2) \"Balkanization of the Commons\"\n\nIt is the nature of copyleft licenses to conflict with each other. We\nhave no really good solution for defining \"a free license\" so that we\ncan make the sort of claim where a license binds other licenses simply\nto be \"free licenses\".\n\nWe can't even agree within the free software/free culture community what\nexactly constitutes a \"free license\", so how can we expect the courts to\nfigure it out?\n\nWe are saved to a degree by the limited scope of existing copyleft\nterms. They allow any license (including other free licenses) to be\napplied to \"mere containers\" and to siblings within the same container,\nso they prevent lock-ups due to license incompatibility.\n\n\n3) \"My Brother's Keeper\"\n\nDefining the \"container\" of a work as a \"derivative\" so that it must be\nlicensed entirely under the same terms also binds all sibling works.\n\nThus, if I have an HTML page with GFDL, GPL, By, and By-SA images in it\n(not to mention \"verbatim use only\", \"By-NC-ND\", or \"fair use\" images),\nthen -- if a container-binding copyleft is applied to any of the above\n\"free\" licenses -- the licensing is locked up and I cannot publish.\n\n\nAs things stand we have a situation with some admitted faults -- it may\nbe a little *too* free. But trying to sew up the loopholes is going to\ncause problems, and I'm not convinced that the cure wouldn't be worse\nthan the disease.\n\nCheers,\nTerry\n\n-- \nTerry Hancock (hancock@AnansiSpaceworks.com)\nAnansi Spaceworks http://www.AnansiSpaceworks.com\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
