She seemed okay, but after a while she slowly started to tilt sideways in her chair.\nTwo attentive nurses immediately rushed up to catch her and straighten her up. Again she seemed okay, but after a while she slowly started to tilt over to her other side.\nThe nurses rushed back and once more brought her back upright. This went on all morning. \nLater, the family arrived to see how the old woman was adjusting to her new home. \"So Ma, how is it here? Are they treating you all right?\"\n\"It's pretty nice,\" she replied. \"Except they won't let me fart.\"The Hearing Aid \nAn elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number of years. \nHe went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100%. \nThe elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, \"Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased that you can hear again.\" \nThe gentleman replied, \"Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will three times!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
