It's taking some real courage today for the students and \n      faculty of Virginia Tech to return to their classrooms. We spoke with \n      Prof. Richard Shryock, who is the chairman \n      of the department of foreign language and literature at Virginia Tech, \n      where he has been teaching for 20 years. This morning, he was scheduled to \n      take over a class where the teacher and several students had been killed. \n      While that takes courage, Shyrock told us it's conversation with students \n      that is inspiring. \n\u00a0\nA lot has changed \n      since we left Blacksburg on Thursday. Many \n      students told us they would not return to class, but there seems to be a \n      groundswell response from the Virginia Tech community to go back to school \n      and basically take back their college. We were incredibly impressed by the \n      entire Virginia Tech community last week, and we hope they can achieve \n      their goals.\n\u00a0\nTomorrow, we will \n      continue our \"Wedding in a Week\" that was postponed because of the tragedy \n      at Virginia Tech.\n\u00a0\nTake \n      care,\n\nHarry SmithEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTo \nunsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \nEmail Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, NY, \n10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc.
