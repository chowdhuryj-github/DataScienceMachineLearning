An\nexample of the code that you were trying to run would\nbe a great help (as it says down below :  PLEASE do\nread the posting guide. The point about code is\nimportant.\n\nHowever the first thing to check is your file path.\nThis is my first guess anyway.\n\nHere is the entry in the R FAQ\n----------------------------\nAs R uses C-style string handling, `\\' is treated as\nan escape character, so that for example one can enter\na newline as `\\n'. When you really need a `\\', you\nhave to escape it with another `\\'.\n\nThus, in filenames use something like\n\"c:\\\\data\\\\money.dat\". You can also replace `\\' by `/'\n(\"c:/data/money.dat\"). \n--------------------------\n\nI am not familiar with textpad but you might want to\nhave a look at tinn-r which is very closely integrated\nwith R as an alternative editor\n\n--- Mary Royerr  wrote:\n\n> I have installed textpad and tried running R code.\n> But it gives me the\n> following error message.\n> \n> \n> \n> The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax\n> is incorrect.\n> \n> Tool completed with exit code 1\n> \n> \n> Can you provide any help?
