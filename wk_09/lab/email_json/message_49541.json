I have a file xls entitled dali following this directory:c://programfiles//R 2.4.0. Recently I have installed xlsreadwrite 1.3.2. but , when I wrote the following lines:\n> >library(xlsReadWrite)\n> >read.xls( file, colNames = TRUE, sheet = 1, type = \"data.frame\",  from = 1, colClasses = NA )\n> I obtained from R console the following messages:\n> Error in library(xlsReadWrite)\n> impossible to find the function\"read.xls\".\n\nxlsReadWrite 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 won't work with R2.4.0. They need R2.4.1 at least.\nUnfortunately xlsReadWrite 1.3.2 didn't check this requirement\nproperly, but v1.3.3 does. IIRC (I am not in my office right now) the\nreason for it is the argument: \"stringsAsFactors =\ndefault.stringsAsFactors()\".\n\nYou have 2 options:\n- use R version 2.4.1 or 2.5.0.\n- download the package in source form, remove the\ndefault.stringsAsFactors() part and build the binary package from this\nmodified source.\n\nBTW, according to the posting guide you should have contacted the\nmaintainer (me) first before posting to R-help. But I didn't get an\nemail from you...\n\nHope this helps and best regards,\nHans-Peter\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
