I'd like  \nto flag them as NN.  Right now, if you pass in a NULL, you get back a  \nNULL, and nothing is checking the return value to make sure that it's  \nnot NULL.\n\nIf I don't hear anything, I'll go ahead and do this tonight or tomorrow.\n\nxoxo,\nAndy\n\n--\nAndy Lester => andy@petdance.com => www.petdance.com => AIM:petdance\n\n\n\n\n"}
