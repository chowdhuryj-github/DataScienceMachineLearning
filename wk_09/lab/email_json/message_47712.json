For example, what \nis length(ht) with ht being a matrix? For R it is the total number of \nelements, but did you mean this or the number of rows/columns??\n\nThe suggestion to read R-Intro is the best advice you got here.\n\nPetr\n\n-- \nPetr Klasterecky\nDept. of Probability and Statistics\nCharles University in Prague\nCzech Republic\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
