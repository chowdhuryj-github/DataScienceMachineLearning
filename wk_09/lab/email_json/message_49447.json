Have a look at\nh> http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/stat_quantile.html for some examples of\nh> what that might look like.\nI tried the ggplot2 package, it seems to be quite powerful. But\ndocumentation is only partially available, so I'm having some problems\ncreating the graphs at all.\n\nFirst of all, where can I find the diamonds and dsmall data? I cannot\nrecreate the samples given in the documentation.\n\nI'm currently using a simple smoother to display the tendency of the\ndata and it's stderr. For some reason, it works only for simple\ncolors:\n\np <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Problemsize, y=Fitness)) +\n  geom_smooth(fill=alpha(\"blue\", 0.2), colour=\"darkblue\", size=2)\n\nThis does only display a line, not the surrounding stderr. When I\nchange the fill atrribute to \"blue\" or \"grey80\" without the alpha, the\nstderr gets displayed.\n\nAdditionally, I want to display three different models by this, each\nwith a differen curve/stderr fill color. How do I do that? I tried so\nset color=Model, which yields only a single line.\n\nOn another plot, I want to use a single model to be displayed with\npoints colored by a gradient depending on a third property:\n\np <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Problemsize, y=Fitness), color=DeltaConfig) +\n  geom_smooth(size=1, color=\"black\", fill=\"grey80\")+\n  geom_point(size=0.5)+\n  scale_colour_gradient(limits=c(0,10), low=\"red\", high=\"white\")\n\nThis does not work, I think the connection between goem_point and\nDeltaConfig is not there. But when I try to set\n\n  geom_point(size=0.5, color=DeltaConfig)+\n\nit complains about an unknown DeltaConfig object.\n\nHmm, I guess I don't fully understand this 'grammar of graphics'\nthing. But documentation is quite inconsistent. :( And, the coloring\nthing seems to be a bug. BTW, I'm using R 2.5.0 on windows.\n\nGreetings,\nArne\n\n\n\nh> On 6/16/07, Arne Brutschy  wrote:\n>> Hello,\n>>\n>> I'm currently using a simple plot to visualize some mean values.
