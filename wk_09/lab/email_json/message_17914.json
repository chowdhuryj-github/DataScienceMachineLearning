In Matlab there is a toolbox\nthat converts a m-script into C-code. \nOne application in mind is that I do the model building in R,\nfor estimating the risk for cancer based on clinical measurements.\n\nWhen the model is ready, a small R-program can simulate\nthe model to estimate the risk for a new patient. The idea is\nthat a doctor gets the measurements for the patient sitting in his\noffice.  Then he goes to Internet and types in the test measuremnets\nand gets the estimated risk.\nLook at www.finne.info for an early version to get the idea.\nThere I developed the model in Matlab and converted it to Excel.\nDon't use the results!  Much better are available in R!\nThere are many more applications that need a higher degree\nof integration.\n\nThan you in advance.\n\nRalf Finne\nSYH, University of Applied Sciences\nVasa Finland\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
