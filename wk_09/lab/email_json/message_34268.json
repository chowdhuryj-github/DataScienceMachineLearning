If you are asking about hazard ratios for x2 --- there are \nnone.  That is the point of a strata; you are declaring a variable to NOT be \nproportional hazards, and thus there is no single \"hazard ratio\" that describes \nit.\n\n\tTerry Therneau\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
