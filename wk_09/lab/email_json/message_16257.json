When i look into summary lm() of model\nall cross terms coefficients are NA. What does this\nmean? Is the regression is not able to solve for these\ncoefficients due to some reason.  Or does this mean\nthat i should not consider these terms.\nRegards,\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
