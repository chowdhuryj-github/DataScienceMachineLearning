This modifier allows you to use both whitespace and\ncomments inside your regular expressions.\n\nSince you obviously don't know what the /x modifier does, why are you\nusing it?  Blindly typing code that you don't understand is a really\nbad way to program.\n\nPaul Lalli\n\nP.S.  (Yes, I know PBP recommends always using /mxs, but anyone who\nuses /msx on every regexp because PBP recommends it should at least\nread enough of PBP to know *why* its recommended)\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
