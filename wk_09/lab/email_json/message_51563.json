There are two other very powerful\npackages in R that handle this kind of thing: ade4 and vegan.  Have a\nthorough look at both of them.  You should be looking at Principal\nCoordinate Analysis (Classical Scaling) and Non Metric Multidimensional\nScaling (NMDS)---with, as Gavin has said, your species as rows.  At least\nthe first of these methods goes hand-in-glove with cluster analysis.\n\nGiven that you are based in Switzerland, and perhaps are Swiss, you probably\ntherefore read and speak French as a second/third language.  You may\ntherefore find the ade4 package more useful, since its authors are French,\nand its principal authors, Prof. Daniel Chessel &c., have made publicly\navailable some exceptionally useful documentation on these methods on their\nade4 website.  These are mainly Prof. Chessel's lecture notes:\n\nhttp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/R/enseignement.html\n\nI hope that speeds you on your way.\n\nRegards,\nMark.\n\nPS: Apropos of the Legendre & Legendre text: It's well worth buying if you\nwork in this area; one of its authors, Pierre Legendre, now collaborates\nwith Jari Oksanen on some functions of the vegan package.\n\n\nGavin Simpson wrote:\n> \n> On Wed, 2007-06-20 at 16:13 +0200, Birgit Lemcke wrote:\n>> Hello Stephen,\n>> \n>> I am happy that you help me.
