For information, I installed Eclipse 3.2.1, the Java Sun Vm 1.5 and \n1.6, all provided by the Debian mirrors.I already found on the net to change my prefrences of the used java using the update-alternatives command and I also created a .eclipse/eclipserc file in my home dir to specify the JAVA_HOME to use.\nI saw a difference at first when switching from the default vm (gcj) to the Sun VM; eclipse with gcj is really awful slow. But, my question is rather in comparing with the Eclipse behaviour under MS Windows I use at work. How come that I notice such a great difference between the same software under Debian and under Windows? \nIs there something to configure to make this work better? I also heared of several alternatives to the Sun VM (if this is the problem) like BlackDown Java; will my eclipse run faster if I use this one?I though with such a performant laptop I would have no trouble making Eclipse and java run, but it seems that neither the quality of the laptop\u00a0 nor the amount of RAM (2Go) make a difference. \nDoes someone had the same problems or can somebody tell me from where it does come from (maybe it's only that the Sun VM is optimized for Windows???).Thanks a lotRegardsAlexandre\n"}
