We are not longer pulling from random yum repos\nand will only accept RPMS that come from the OLPC fedora repository.  In\nEToys' case this means the squeak-vm and etoys rpms need to pass the\nFedora packaging guidelines and in particular the etoys rpm should be\nsplit into an rpm and activity.\n\nWhoever will be maintaining the etoys packages should look at\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/Join\n\nI will be available to step them through the process and can sponsor\nthem.  Multiple people can co-own a package so feel free to have a\ncouple of people go through the process.\n\n-- \nJohn (J5) Palmieri \n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
