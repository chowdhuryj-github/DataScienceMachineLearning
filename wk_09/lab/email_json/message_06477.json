So I guess my\nquestion is how do I reference the data points to drop from the\nregression by name?\n\nThanks\nMandy\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nWARNING: This email and any attachments may be confidential ...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
