Victor, can\nyou enlighten us a bit more please on which file formats and what is\nwritten?\n\nRoan, can you also let us know what you looked at doing with this? Roan\nworked on adding SVG write support...he added SVG read support.\n\nNOTE: The getid3 library should be renamed because it does way more than\njust getting id3 metadata out of files...it also reads and writes\ndifferent metadata from different file types.\n\n> At present, Only HTML, RSS, MP3, Ogg, PDF, image formats, SMIL had\n> supported Creative Commons Metadat.\n> (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/UsingMarkup)\n> Are there other file formats?\n\nYes, this list is not complete by any means. Yes, we would love to\nsupport the best approaches outlined on the Creative Commons wiki for\nmetadata embedding. The current recommendation is to use Adobe's XMP\n(http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP) for every file type, with the\nmajor exception being mp3, of which, id3 is an established hacky\nstandard.\n\n> I went to embed Creative Commons Metadat in supported files in cchost,\n> how can I do that?

Also, you might\nwant to have this discussion as well on cc-devel, which I will cc...\n\nJon\n\n> Thanks,\n> Snic\n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> This SF.net email is sponsored by DB2 Express\n> Download DB2 Express C - the FREE version of DB2 express and take\n> control of your XML.
