The typical\nway to fix this is to locate the logical beginning of that variable's\nscope and add a line like this:\n\n    my(%r, $any_others);\n\nNow you've declared the variables %r and %any_others you need for that\nscope, so you won't surprise Perl and get those \"requires explicit\npackage name\" messages.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
