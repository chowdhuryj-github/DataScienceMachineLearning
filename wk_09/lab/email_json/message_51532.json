As you said in the original message, all you need is\n\n*dest = *src;\n\nsince the compiler will automatically complain if the two pointers\ndon't point to the same type of object.  AFAICT, the wrapping around\nthe assignment in the macro just makes sure that there aren't any side\neffects - but the only reason side effects would be a problem is that\nit's a macro...\n\n-- \nMark J.
