If you have only\n786 MB of RAM on your machine and you are using ~500 of it in a\nsession of R, that could slow things down considerably because your\nmachine is trying to find free blocks of memory that haven't been used\nyet. I would buy additional RAM.\n\nAs for Mike Prager's point about the type of hard drive being\nimportant, I'm not sure this is right (someone correct me if I'm\nmisunderstanding). R stores and accesses objects through RAM - they\naren't stored and accessed on the hard drive except when reading and\nwriting. So hard drive type probably won't make much difference to\nspeed in R.\n\nMatt\n\nOn 6/20/07, Robert McFadden  wrote:\n>\n> > -----Original Message-----\n> > From: Prof Brian Ripley [mailto:ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk]\n> > The advantage of dual processors is that you can use the\n> > machine for several things at once, including multiple R\n> > jobs.
