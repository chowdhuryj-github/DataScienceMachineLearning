Do you have some base \npackages for less recent version of R installed in a non-standard \nlibrary that is in the search path? .libPaths() should reveal other \nlibraries.\n\nUwe Ligges\n\n\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
