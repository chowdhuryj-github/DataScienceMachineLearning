(Proposal)", "body": "Hello,\n\nI am new to the OLPC project and don't know if there are already \nsome proposals in this field.\n\nWhen starting an application like the paint tool I was asking myself \nthe following questions:\n\nSince one tries to replace words with symbols in sugar, why are you \nusing the good old save dialogs?\n\nWouldn't it be nice to have a replacement for this?\n\nIf you remove filenames from the user interface but not the files \nthemselves (would be too heavy probably), you must still deal with \nfiles under the hood. Therefore a new naming technique is required.\n\n\nOne could name files by drawing a little symbol and then a small \nemblem is attached to the symbol to identify the file type (e.g. \na sheet of paper to identify a write file). Internally there still \ncan be filenames, but not at GUI level!\n\nPlease tell me what you think!\n\nKonrad\n\nPS: I'm currently studying applied computer science at a German university \nand a group of about 20 people of our class is willing to help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
