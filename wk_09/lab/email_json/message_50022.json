I choose the \nhappening of stroke (positive) as the dependent variable, and waist \ncircumference as an independent variable. Then I wanna to obtain the OR \nand 95% CI with 1 SD change of waist circumference.how?\n\nAny default package(s) or options in glm available now?\n\nif not, how to calculate them by hand?\n\nmany thanks.\n\nyours,sincerely,\nXingwang Ye\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
