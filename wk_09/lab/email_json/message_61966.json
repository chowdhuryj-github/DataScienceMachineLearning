Even their examples are general and applied in Support Vector \nClassification.\n\n   Could anybody please introduce an example code for regression case.\n[\\quote]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
