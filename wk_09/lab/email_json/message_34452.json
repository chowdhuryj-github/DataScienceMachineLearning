Cain\" <greg@gregorycain.net>", "subject": "Samba with Autocad Sheet Set Manager", "body": "Hello,\n\nWe are a 30-person architectural office in Sacramento, California, using \nAutoCAD 2006 on Windows.  Our main file server is running Samba \n3.0.10.1.4E.6 on RedHat Enterprise ES 4.\n\nThis release of AutoCAD has something called a \"Sheet Set Manager,\" \nwhich uses a master file (.dst file) which needs to be open and \naccessible to all project users while they are working on their \nprojects.  AutoCAD does not lock this file when it opens it.  The Linux \npermissions are set correctly on these files.  Samba is also not locking \nthe files - smbstatus -L | grep .dst returns nothing.\n\nThe problem is that only the owner of the file is able to write to the \nfile - something is locking it.  One post I've read refers to the \n\"sticky bit,\" and perhaps that's what's causing the problem, but I don't \nknow exactly what that is or how to fix the problem.\n\nI've tried moving the file to a share on a newer server - Samba \n3.0.14a-6ubuntu1.2 running on ubuntu 5.10 - Breezy, but the problem \nstill exists.  I've set up a share on a Windows 2000 Pro (not server) \ndesktop, and the files work as they should. \n\nI could, I guess, continue to run this way except for the fact that a \nWindows desktop can only accept 10 connections at one time.\n\nI really, really, really do not want to have to buy a Windows server to \nfix this problem, but I do have to fix it.  If anyone can shed some \nlight on this, it would be very, very much appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nGreg\n\n"}
