I compiled it from source using the tarball \nat freebsoft.org.  When I execute speech-dispatcher after successful \ncompile, I get a message that says unable to create pid in \n/var/run.  I've even tried this as root and have the same message \ndisplayed.  Is there something I'm missing?  As always, thanks in \nadvance for all the help.  If this has been answered before, I'm \nsorry for duplicating the question.\n\n\nGuy (ubuntu feisty user)\nP.S.  Anyone know who to contact about getting a hold of IBMTTS? \n(viavoice for Linux)  I was reading on the LASR home page, and it \nseemed like you should be able to get a copy.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
