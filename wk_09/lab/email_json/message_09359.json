But his bizarre behavior had been noticed \u2013 two women\n  at Virginia Tech say they raised concerns in 2005 about Cho\u2019s repeated\n  attempts to contact them. When can a school take steps against a student it\n  suspects might someday cause harm? Cynthia\n  Bowers will have the details. \n\n  The paper trail Cho left behind helps fill in the picture. Sharyn Alfonsi will report on Cho\u2019s\n  alarming creative writing pieces, the ranting note he left behind and the\n  latest on the investigation into Monday\u2019s massacre. \n\n  A significant part of that investigation hinges on forensic evidence, and\n  some of that is locked inside the computer Cho owned and used. Technology correspondent\n  Daniel Sieberg will report on\n  how authorities are extracting information from the gunman\u2019s hard\n  drive. \n\n  Also, Thalia Assuras will have\n  an emotional interview with a young woman who lives near the site of the\n  first shooting Monday. It\u2019s a dramatic account. \n\n  In other news, the Supreme Court upheld the country\u2019s ban on certain\n  abortions this morning. The justices ruled 5-4 that the Partial Birth\n  Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed four yeas ago\n  is constitutionally sound. Wyatt Andrews\n  will have more on the decision. Our chief legal analyst, Andrew Cohen, will also weigh in on the\n  implications of the decision. \n\n  Finally, it has been an extraordinarily deadly day in Baghdad, where more than 175 people were\n  killed in a series of bombings \u2013 the worst day of violence since the\n  American troop surge began a few months ago. Martin Seemungal will report. \n\nI hope you\u2019ll join us. \n\nKatie \n\nFor more information on these stories,\n  please click on the following links: \n\nOfficials: Gunman Left \"Suicide\n  Note\" \nClick Here \n\nHigh Court Upholds Ban On Some Abortions\n\nClick Here \n\nAnd here\u2019s a look at one of the\n  stories we\u2019re working on for Thursday\u2019s broadcast: \n\n  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales goes to Capitol Hill to fight for his job.\n  That story and much more, Thursday, on the CBS Evening News. \n\n  If you would like more information on any of these stories or the broadcast,\n  please click on the following address and e-mail us: \nevening@cbsnews.com\n  \n\n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON DAVID LETTERMAN\n\n  Join Dave tonight on The\n  Late Show with actress Edie Falco AND comedian Paul Scheer...\n  Plus, musical guests Son Volt! \n\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY\n  SHOW\n\nHarry Smith\n  and Kelly Wallace will anchor THE EARLY SHOW from\n  Blacksburg, VA.
