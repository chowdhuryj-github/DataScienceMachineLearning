The recommended way todo it is to first set up Cygwin, which might be more trouble than you'rewilling to go through. Even then, it'll run quite slowly because ofcertain FS ops being substantially slower on Windows than on Linux.\n> Alternatively is there anyway to use git on the olpc itself, does anyone> have those instructions? \nAs root, 'yum install git-core' should do it.\n> are preloading an array of 26 images ~32K each and this crashes on the> olpc.\nPlease provide more details. Memory allocation shouldn't *crash* themachine under any (reasonable set of) circumstances; the OOM killermight kick in and destroy a few processes, however. In your case, you'reallocating less than a meg, so something is certainly wrong if it'scrashing. What kind of crash are you getting? Can you post the code andthe images somewhere where we can test this?\n-- Ivan Krsti\\u0107  | GPG: 0x147C722D_______________________________________________Sugar mailing listSugar@lists.laptop.orghttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
