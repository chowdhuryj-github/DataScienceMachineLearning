How do you reference rows in \"subset=\" for which you know the \nrownames, but not the row numbers?\n\n2. How do you discovery the rows corresponding to particular \nrownames? (Using plasma[rownames(plasma)==17,] shows the data, but \nNOT the row number!) (Probably the same answer as in Q. 1 above.)\n\n3. How do you sort (order) the rows of an existing data frame so that \nthe rownames are in order?\n\nI don't seem to know the magic words to find the answers to these \nquestions in the help systems.\n\nObviously this can be done by writing new, brute force, functions \nscanning the subscripts, but there must be an (obvious?) direct way \nof doing this more elegantly.\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n================================================================\nRobert A.
