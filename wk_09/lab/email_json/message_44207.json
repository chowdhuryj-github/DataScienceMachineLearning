So how can I fix this?\n\nAs I wrote in another thread on this list recently, It should work if \nyou use Speech Dispatcher both with Orca and Speakup.  Speech Dispatcher \nwill handle speech from both clients for you.  Problems may arise when \nyou try to use one synthesizer through two different speech systems \n(Speech Dispatcher and Gnome Speech).\n\nBest regards\n\nTomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
