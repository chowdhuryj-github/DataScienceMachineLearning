A few suggestions:\n\n  - look in config.log to see a few more details\n  - run autoconf on your system to build a new configure script from the \nconfigure.ac input.\n  - ask Redhat for help\n  - try previous versions of the configure script (available from the \nsvn server; see rgl.neoscientists.org for details).  There have been a \nlot of changes to it lately to try to get it to work on systems I have \naccess to; unfortunately yours isn't one of them.  Perhaps a previous \niteration would have worked for you.  If you can figure out what's \nwrong, please let me know, and if it doesn't break other systems, it \nmight make it into 0.72.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n> \n>  \n> \n> checking GL/gl.h usability... no\n> \n> checking GL/gl.h presence... yes\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h: present but cannot be compiled\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h: see the Autoconf documentation\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h:     section \"Present But Cannot Be\n> Compiled\"\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/gl.h: in the future, the compiler will take\n> precedence\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------------ ##\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## Report this to the AC_PACKAGE_NAME lists.  ##\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------------ ##\n> \n> checking for GL/gl.h... yes\n> \n> checking GL/glu.h usability... no\n> \n> checking GL/glu.h presence... yes\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h: present but cannot be compiled\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h:     check for missing prerequisite\n> headers?\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h: see the Autoconf documentation\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h:     section \"Present But Cannot Be\n> Compiled\"\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result\n> \n> configure: WARNING: GL/glu.h: in the future, the compiler will take\n> precedence\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------------ ##\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## Report this to the AC_PACKAGE_NAME lists.  ##\n> \n> configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------------ ##\n> \n> checking for GL/glu.h... yes\n> \n> checking for glEnd in -lGL... no\n> \n> configure: error: missing required library GL\n> \n> ERROR: configuration failed for package 'rgl'\n> \n> ** Removing '/usr/local/R-2.3.1/library/rgl'\n> \n>  \n> \n> I have verifed libraries are in the correct locations.
