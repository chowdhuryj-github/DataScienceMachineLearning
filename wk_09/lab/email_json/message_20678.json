My understanding is that I can convert this to a ROC curve  \nby getting hits and false alarms at the various confidence ratings.   \nI figured out that part of the problem.  I noticed a few functions  \nfor calculating AUC.  Are there any preferred ones for this  \nparticular kind of design?\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
