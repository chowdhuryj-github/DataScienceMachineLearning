Is\nthere an AP within range? If so, does it use encryption (WEP / WPA[2])?\nCan you reach the AP using any other system / OS? From the same\nlocation as your linux box? What chipset is the card? What drivers is\nndiswrapper using?\n\nCelejar\n--\nmailmin.sourceforge.net - remote access via secure (OpenPGP) email\nssuds.sourceforge.net - A Simple Sudoku Solver and Generator\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
