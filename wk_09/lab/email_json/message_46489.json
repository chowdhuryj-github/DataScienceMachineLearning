I just got internet access yesterday at our new home.  I \nwill be working on the RMySQL binary later this week if possible.  There \nis a hitch in compiling the binary.  I have the binaries for an older \nversion of MySQL on which the R compilation worked.  A newer version of \nMySQL 5.0.37, I never was able to get the R binaries to compile.\n\nI appreciate your patience here because I have a new job and my family \nand I are trying to organize our new home right now.\n\nThank you\nJoe\n\n\nHenric Nilsson (Public) wrote:\n> Den Ti, 2007-02-13, 11:43 skrev Ravi S.
