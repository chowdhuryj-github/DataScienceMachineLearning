They sold a software pack you could buy for their  \nnotetakers that would give you some additional capabilities.\nThe problem was, they wanted several hundred dollars for the floppy  \ndrive their system used.\n(although you could turn your pc into a floppy for the note taker if  \nso desired) This is the program I wrote my own driver for (though I  \nnever finished it, so it's not really distributable)\nBut, it's easy enough to pretend to be the drive, and watch what the  \ndevice sends back.\nLots of drivers are written using this approach.\nAnd, I see no reason why usb devices should be any different.\n\n\nOn Jun 24, 2007, at 1:04 PM, C.M.
