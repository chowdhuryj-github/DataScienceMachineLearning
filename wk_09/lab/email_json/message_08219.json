You might \nbe able to get away with exporting the DISPLAY environment variable\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0 # try and connect to X server on display 0.0\n\nwithin your script, but it will only work if the script is executed by \nthe same user as is running the X server, *and* the X server is running \nat the time the script is executed.\n\nThere are a handful of packages that will create a png without the \npresence of an X server, and I'm partial to Cairo (since I've done some \nwork on it). You can install the latest version like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"Cairo\",,'http://rforge.net/',type='source')\n\nCairo can also outputs nice pdf's with embedded fonts... useful if you \nwant to embed high-quality OpenType or TrueType fonts.\n\nBest,\n\nJeff\n-- \nhttp://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/JeffreyHorner\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
