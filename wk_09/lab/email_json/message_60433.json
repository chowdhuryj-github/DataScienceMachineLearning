Thanks.\n\nYes.  They are gcc-specific.  A plain -p is common on Unix systems, but \n-pg is gcc-specific.  For example, with Sun's C compiler, -xpg would be \nthe equivalent flag.  (Though Sun's C compiler also has other profile \noptions selected by -xprofile.  I haven't looked at them in ages, so I \ncan't tell you anything useful about them.)\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
