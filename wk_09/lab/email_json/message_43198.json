I need Postfix to send email out of my server to other email addresses.\nIt would be like say I create a message here and if it is for a certain\nperson then it would forward it to the correct email address on the\nInternet?\n2.  I also need it to work with Mailman.  I need to send list messages out.\n3.  I need Postfix to be the mail transport agent for Pilotalk.com and sends\nall messages which have a Pilotalk.com address through the Internet?  This\nwould go through Dyndns.org as the host provider.  The address is:\nMailpilotalk.dydns.biz\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nScott \n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
