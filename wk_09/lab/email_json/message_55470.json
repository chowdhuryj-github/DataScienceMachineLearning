Also, last time I checked rspush only\nsupported standalone branches, not repositories. That would mean\nsending about 200M every time I create a branch...\n\nI need all these revisions since they are required for bzr-svn to work\ncorrectly (until the history horizon stuff lands).\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n\n-- \nJelmer Vernooij  - http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/\n\n"}
