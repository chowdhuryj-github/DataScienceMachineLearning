I did the groundwork for it already, by \nrefactoring the NameSpace PMC so that there is a place to hang such a \nthing off now (just add it to the underlying struct), though I was doing \nit so there was a slot to hang the class that the namespace maps to \nfrom.

With PMCProxy \nnow existing, I suspect we can do the same for non-vtable methods of \nPMCs too...\n\nJonathan\n\n"}
