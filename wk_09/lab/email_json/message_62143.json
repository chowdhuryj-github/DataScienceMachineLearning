I want a legend that explains what line\ntypes correspond to the different race/ethnicity groups. I used the\nfollowing code:\n\n\nlegend( 1992 , 42  , c(\"Hispanic\" , \"non-Hispanic white (NHW)\" ,\n\"non-Hispanic black\" , \"AI/AN\" , \"Asian\" ) , lty=1:5 ,cex = .6 , bty='n'\n)\n\nGuess what? The legend \"box\" was so narrow that the line types that show\nup in that legend box look essentially the same, because they are short.\nI.e, although a line type might be a long dash followed by a short dash,\nonly the long dash shows up in the box. The consequence of this is that\nthe race/ethnic group that corresponds to the line type that is only a\nlong dash cannot be distinguished from the legend.\n\nHow do I stretch that legend box out so as to allow lty to draw longer\nline segments?\n\nPlease reply to: pzs6@cdc.gov\n\nMany thanks!\nPhil Smith\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
