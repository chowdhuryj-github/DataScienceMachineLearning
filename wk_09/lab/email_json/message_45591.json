If EXPR is omitted, uses\n            $_. You should not use this function for rounding: one because\n            it truncates towards 0, and two because machine representations\n            of floating point numbers can sometimes produce counterintuitive\n            results. For example, \"int(-6.725/0.025)\" produces -268 rather\n            than the correct -269; that's because it's really more like\n            -268.99999999999994315658 instead. Usually, the \"sprintf\",\n            \"printf\", or the \"POSIX::floor\" and \"POSIX::ceil\" functions will\n            serve you better than will int().\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
