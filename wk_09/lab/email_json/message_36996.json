There are\ninstructions on how to do this on the grml wiki. Note though that in\nmy humble opinion, you need to be an advanced gnu/linux user to pull\nthis off, and be prepared for screw-ups. No, I haven't done this\nspecifically, but did have to install distros via chroot in the past.\n\nGreg\n\n\n\nOn Sat, May 26, 2007 at 10:52:48PM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hiya,\n>     I don't have access to a hardware speech synthesizer, and so was wondering what the options are for me to get a Debian install.
