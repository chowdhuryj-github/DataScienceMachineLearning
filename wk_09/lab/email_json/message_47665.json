Although I do not\nshare  nor condone the reasons   why  various countries  at WIPO  (and\nelsewhere) do not want to use the term, I think we  might want to make\nsure that even the proponents of A2K  have a true common understanding\nof what the term ought to mean, and not just one that shifts according\nto  the tactical opportunities  they are faced with  -  which is a bad\nthing in and by itself, but might be  counter-productive in the remote\ncase we are ever in a position to plan in the *real* long term.\n\nOr does this mean I am the only one that has some doubts on the actual\nmeaning of A2K?\n\nCiao,\n\n--\n      Andrea Glorioso || http://people.digitalpolicy.it/sama/cv/\n          M: +39 348 921 4379\t     F: +39 051 930 31 133\n       \"Truth is a relationship between a theory and the world;\n       beauty is a relationship between a theory and the mind.\"\n--\n[ Content of type application/pgp-signature deleted ]\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
