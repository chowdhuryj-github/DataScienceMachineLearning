Extending qemu disk image to 1GB:\ndd bs=1 if=/dev/zero of=olpc-development-ext3.img\nseek=1G count=0\n\n2. Boot image with System Rescue CD (http://www.sysresccd.org):\nqemu -hda olpc-development-ext3.img -cdrom systemrescuecd.iso\n-boot d\n\n3. Check Filesystem:\ne2fsk -fD /dev/hda1\n\n4. Resize partition:\nparted /dev/hda\n(parted) resize 1 31.7kB 1GB\n\nWhich ends up with an \"Error: File system has\nan incompatible feature enabled\" Message :-((\n\nSo I will probably add a second disk and use it as\n/home.\n\nAny tips how to put an OpenSSH server on the developer\nimage?\nUsing the TTY is somewhat annoying, because it's screwes\nup things like nano or top.\n\n\ncu andreas \n"}
