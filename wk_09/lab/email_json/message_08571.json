Not being able to protect the trademark against misuse that\nreflects badly on Debian seriously diminishes the value of holding such a\ntrademark at all.\n\n> Use of a trademark to harm the reputation of the trademark holder is an\n> essential right for those who wish to attack the trademark holder for\n> what they see as bad behavior.\n\nHrm, there is a difference between *referencing* a trademark when\ncriticizing the holder, and *using* the mark, in trade, in a way that\nreflects badly on Debian.  TTBOMK, it is always legal under US trademark law\nto make nominative use of a trademark, whether for criticism or otherwise.\n\n> We just want to disallow actual infringement, not these other things.\n\nI don't know who the \"we\" is on whose behalf you're speaking here.\n\n-- \nSteve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\nDebian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\nvorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
