(2) Have you thought about how large a community you\nneed?\u00a0 If it's very small, there may be too few voters to establish a\nmeaningful baseline so there might be a need to build the community first.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat is the community in this case?\u00a0 Well that could take many forms\ndepending on the media and/or mode of distribution.\u00a0 In the music\nindustry, diehard fans could determine, through some type of ranking system,\nhow each artist should be paid out.\u00a0 If, however, asking the public to\naudit contribution becomes too overwhelming, there could be a pool of editors\nthat get paid to make these assessments.\u00a0\u00a0 This system of editors,\nhowever, would have to be anonymous in a sense, to avoid the possibility of\nbribery or kickbacks.\u00a0 An additional safeguarding mechanism could be\nutilized were the editors in turn rank each other.\u00a0 Editors that show an\nunusual high level of bias would be flagged by the community of editors and\nthus facilitate a higher level of consistency.\n\nOverall, this idea sounds quite useful.\u00a0 A good reputation system can be\nused to \"rate the rater\" and help ensure integrity in the review\nprocess.\n\nThis \"information revelation\" mechanism looks like it should require\na subsidy i.e. some means of compensating the raters for their time and\neffort.\u00a0 If done well, it could be covered out of the revenues generated\nby the pool of derivative works themselves.\n\nAnother form of information disclosure mechanism could be to have people who\nactually download the derivative work themselves state what % of value the new\npiece adds.\u00a0 This is harder to \"fake\" since someone must\nactually pay for the good (so if you're going to stuff a ballot box it's going\nto be costly).\u00a0 It's also unbiased because the person doing the buying is\nnot independent of the person doing the rating.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAlthough I\u2019m sure there\u2019s ways to establish a fair assessment of\nvalue, this licensing system would require a transparency in accounting as well\u00adsuch\nthat contributors would be assured that all the revenue is accounted for.\u00a0\nTransparent accounting might be a tall order, but if artists demand it,\nproducers will find a way too oblige.\u00a0 \n\nThis is also an excellent point.\u00a0 It has long been an established tenet of\neconomics that more complete information leads to greater efficiency in\nproduction.\u00a0 Such a system should be as transparent as possible.\n\nNote also that it should also align incentives the right way e.g. no one should\nhave a reason to misrepresent their rating, and the raters' votes should\ncorrespond closely to the consumers' reasons for buying.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAnyways, Just a little food for thought.\u00a0 Let me know if there\u2019s any\nmajor hurdles I\u2019m not considering in implementing a system like\nthis\u2026 just thinking out loud here.\n\nPersonally, I think the questions you raise are very interesting.\u00a0 Plenty\nof thought munchies here! :-)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIs there any current discussion out there that addresses this idea?\u00a0 I\ncould not find any. If you could forward, I\u2019d be much appreciative. \n\nThere is some good discussion on the Free Software Business (fsb) discussion\ngroup but aside from that, I've found very little on this topic.\u00a0 Thanks\nfor raising some interesting issues.\n\nMVA\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n_______________________________________________\nCc-bizcom mailing list\nCc-bizcom@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-bizcom\n\n\n\n"}
