Both compile and install \nsatisfactorily.\n\nBut when I come to run it:\n\n> > library('JGR')\n>\n> Loading required package: rJava\n> Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :\n>         unable to load shared library\n> '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rJava/libs/rJava.so':\n> /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rJava/libs/rJava.so: undefined symbol:\n> JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs Error: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'rJava'\n> Error: package 'rJava' could not be loaded\n\n\nWhen I first tried to run it without Java being installed, I got a message \nsaying that JDK wasn't installed but mentioned 1.4.2.  The version of Java \nactually installed as the latest from the Ubuntu repository is Sun 1.5.0.11.  \nI don't see the point in installing old versions of Java just for one \napplication because the language, or at least the writing, should be \nbackwards compatible.  \n\nIn all aspects I have seen Kubuntu is a very impressive in checking \ncompatibility.  Unfortunately this is frequently not the case with Java.  I \nsteer clear of Java as much as possible.  \n\nCan anyone suggest what I should do?  Use Windows perhaps?  Run Windows in a \nkvm virtual machine just to run R?  Put my head in a bucket of cold water?  \nIs there an alternative IDE?  Is there a later JGR somewhere that is not yet \non CRAN?\n\nTIA\n\n-- \nBest wishes\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Logsdon                               \"Try to make things as simple\nQuantex Research Ltd, Manchester UK         as possible but not simpler\"\nj.logsdon@quantex-research.com              a.einstein@relativity.org\n+44(0)161 445 4951/G:+44(0)7717758675       www.quantex-research.com\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
