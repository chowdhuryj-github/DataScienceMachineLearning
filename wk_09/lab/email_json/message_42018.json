The problem is to remain an artist once they grow up.\nBereavement is a darkness impenetrable to the imagination of the unbereaved.\nDid you ever observe to whom the accidents happen? Chance favors only the prepared mind.\nGetting rid of a delusion makes us wiser than getting hold of a truth.\nWe do not stop playing because we grow old we grow old because we stop playing.\nI did send to you for certain sums of gold, which you denied me.\nTo write is to become disinterested. There is a certain renunciation in art.\nThe artist must conceive with warmth yet execute with coolness.\nSeeing is not always believing.\nSubdue your appetites, my dears, and you've conquered human nature .\nA wicked book cannot repent.\n\u00a0"}
