If those are going to be used as basis for\ndeciding which test(s) to do next, then I concur with Frank's\nreservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do not find goodness-of-fit for distributions very\nuseful, mostly for the reason that failure to reject the null is no\nevidence in favor of the null.  It's difficult for me to imagine why\n\"there's insufficient evidence to show that the data did not come from a\nnormal distribution\" would be interesting.\n\nAndy\n\n \n> >\n> > Frank\n> >\n> >\n> > --\n> > Frank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School \n> of Medicine\n> >                       Department of Biostatistics   \n> Vanderbilt University\n> >\n> \n> \n> --\n> yianni\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------\nNotice:  This e-mail message, together with any\nattachments,...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
