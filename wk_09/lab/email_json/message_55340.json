They occured in keyboard.c and vt.c.  I was wondering if these were well-understood problems with the patch, or are just a sign that I do indeed need to use 2.6.21.5 or something like that without relying on a Slackware package?\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
