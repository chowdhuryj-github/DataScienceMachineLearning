One look under there and what once seemed like your perfect car may have just become a junker that you\u2019re grateful you didn\u2019t purchase!\nNow look at the market as if it were this used car. Catch my drift?\nThis market can appear like nothing at all is wrong \u201cunder the hood\u201d but that my friends, would be a terribly wrong assumption to make.\nWe are experiencing a Frontrunner Collapse!\nMany frontrunner stocks are practically flashing their crumbling states in bright neon.\u00a0  And yet no one seems to be paying attention.\n\nTake these 6 as examples:\n\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) \u2014 a frontrunner in a complete freefall (currently falling below the 200 EMA)!\nIntuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) \u2014 It broke out of its rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence.\u00a0  Indicators are pointing straight down.\nMiddleby Corp. (MIDD) \u2014 This has gone from the 146 mark down to 125 over the past few weeks while the market is supposedly holding up well. What??!!\nMillicom International Cellular SA (MICC) \u2014 Indicators are pointing down on bearish divergence\u2026this one could roll over at any moment.\nTeleTech Holdings Inc. (TTEC) \u2014 Back in April, this was topping but now it\u2019s taking a serious nosedive on massive volume.\nAmgen Inc. (AMGN) \u2014 I can\u2019t even talk about this one.\u00a0  It\u2019s just too scary!\n\n\nOkay, now you have seen behind the magic curtain.\u00a0  You know what is really happening in the market.\u00a0  Do not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear any longer.\nPay attention.\u00a0  Don\u2019t just see what \u201cthey\u201d want you to see.\u00a0  See more of the truth right now \u2014 try my Trending123 service at a special rate.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\nP.S.
