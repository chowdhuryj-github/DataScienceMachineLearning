The minimal value that the absolute function can\ntake is zero and any point (x1,x2)=(x,1-x) where x is between 0 and 1\nwill achieve this value and also respect the constraints that you have\nimposed.  Hence, any such point, including (0.5,0.5) is a solution to\nyour problem.\n\n> the correct solution should be (1,0) or (0,1).\n\nWhy?  Unless there are some additional constraint that you have not\ntold optim() (and us) about, these are two possible solutions from an\ninfinite set of solutions.  As I said, any point of the form (x, 1-x)\nwith x between 0 and 1 is a solution to your problem, unless I am\nmissing something....\n\nCheers,\n\n\tBerwin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
