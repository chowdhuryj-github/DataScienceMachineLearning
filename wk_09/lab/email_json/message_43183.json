For some reason, when I've booted, I've noticed that /dev/mixer, among other things, isn't being created.  I would think that Udev could do that?  Not to mention /dev/dsp and all...\n    Is there something fairly simple I'm missing?\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
