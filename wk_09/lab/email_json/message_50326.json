We are spoiled to the point that we love the official\nrepositories.  Because the official packages go through some testing,\nwe tend to sacrifice a little bit of cutting edge for\nstability/reliability.  If you don't think you need anything specific\nfrom version 2.5.0, I would recommend you to stick with the current\nversion, 2.4.1.  You'll also have several packages already compiled\nfor you if you do that.\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nPaulo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/18/07, M.
