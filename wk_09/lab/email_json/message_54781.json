I haven't tried mercurial.  But I will say that the\nmemory and space requirements (in addition to the better speed)\nof git have displaced bzr on my list currently.  Git has a\na steep learning curve, but here are some space numbers that\nmake up for it IMO.\n\n  $ du -sh /data/src/mirror/*/*\n  43M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0_23.bzr\n  42M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0_24.bzr\n  53M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0_25.bzr\n  56M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0_26.bzr\n  99M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0.bzr\n  58M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0-lightweight.bzr\n  60M     bzr/SAMBA_3_0_RELEASE.bzr\n  312M    bzr/SAMBA_4_0.bzr\n  257M    git/samba\n  558M    svn/samba\n\nThe git repo is a full mirror of the svn repo starting at r1 and is\nalmost 1/2 the space of the svn repo.  I might could squeeze some\nmore space savings with various pack options.\n\nThe git tree I posted has the 3.0.23 - 3.0.26, 3.0 and 4.0 branches\nand is less than 100M (1/3 of the SAMBA_4_0 bzr mirror alone).  And\nto pull that tree at home (basic broadband) is about 3 minutes.\n\n  $ time git clone git://git.samba.org/samba samba-test.git\n  Initialized empty Git repository in .../samba-test.git/.git/\n  remote: Generating pack...\n  remote: Done counting 170913 objects.\n  remote: Deltifying 170913 objects.\n  remote:  100% (170913/170913) done\n  Indexing 170913 objects...\n  remote: Total 170913, written 170913 (delta 131520),\n   reused 166156   (delta 130375)\n   100% (170913/170913) done\n  Resolving 131520 deltas...\n   100% (131520/131520) done\n\n  real    2m45.454s\n  user    0m17.909s\n  sys     0m2.808s\n\n\nIf we were to swap to git, the full svn import would be < 160M\nso the pull be only be slightly longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGf8rnIR7qMdg1EfYRAkvSAKDi3v5ReOBMN4kTdwcpyCuySKugOwCg1/F4\nnusLNIqwTDoi/wa0oxFmbbc=\n=Z8Y3\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
