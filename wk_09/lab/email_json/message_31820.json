Then persp or \ncontour can plot it (or persp3d in the rgl package).\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
