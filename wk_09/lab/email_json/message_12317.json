As far as the names go, that's trademark not \ncopyright, and as far as RMS's ramble, to include that would be to \nmis-represent Richard. If that's not against the Social Contract, it \nshould be.\n\nWhere's the problem? There may be a problem with other licences, but as \nI see it, there is no problem with the GPL (which is being used as an \nexample of this alleged problem). AIUI, the OP is confusing the \nunmodifiability of the licence as a matter of licencing law, and the \ndefault unmodifiability imposed by copyright law (which doesn't apply to \nthe GPL, because RMS/FSF have granted permission to modify it, so long \nas you don't break trademark or \"passing off\" laws in the process).\n\nCheers,\nWol\n-- \nAnthony W.
