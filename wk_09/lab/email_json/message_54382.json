I \nhad my user profile and my admin profile, and didn't mix the two.  It \nwas already set up that way in Debian, and I liked it.  Sometimes it was \na hassle, but it kept me on the straight and narrow for security \npurposes.  I'd rather move things to /etc/skel and not interfere with \nhow others might want to do things.  The global settings are doing that \nto me now, forcing me to keep aliases I don't want.   Thank you \nfor the info.\n\n        Michael\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
