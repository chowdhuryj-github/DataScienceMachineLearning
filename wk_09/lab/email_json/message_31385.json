It shows that the big drug companies do not\ncare about people like me,\" he said.\n\nBoripat echoes the views of the group he belongs to, the Thai Network of\nPeople Living With HIV/AIDS, when he says Bangkok was correct in issuing\ncompulsory licenses to secure cheaper generic drugs. \"We need the new,\ncheap drugs to live longer.\"\n\nIt was a sentiment conveyed in the full-page advertisements taken out by\na coalition of AIDS activists, humanitarian groups and a university to\nhit back at the pro-pharmaceutical lobby's campaign. The generic\nanti-retroviral (ARV) drug produced by the state's pharmaceutical body\nhas \"made a phenomenal contribution in reducing the number of deaths\namong Thai AIDS patients from an average of 7,282 per year between 2001\n[and] 2004 to 3,862 in 2005 and to 1,613 in 2006\", states the\nadvertisement.\n\nAnd a meeting this week between officials from Abbott Laboratories and\nThai officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed\nthat Bangkok has not caved in to pressure from the pharmaceutical lobby\nand the US government over a groundbreaking move to secure cheaper drugs.\n\nIn fact, a Health Ministry official was quoted in the local media\nhinting that Bangkok may not have finished issuing compulsory licenses\nfor ARVs produced by Abbott, given that a significantly lower-priced\ngeneric version of Aluvia, a second-line anti-AIDS drug, is being\noffered by an Indian company.\n\n\"If the Public Health Ministry chose to buy drugs at prices higher than\noffered by other sources, it must be able to give the public a good\nreason to justify its decision,\" Vichai Chokewiwat, head of the Public\nHealth Ministry's panel on compulsory licensing, said in Tuesday's\nBangkok Post newspaper.\n\nThailand's efforts have also received a boost at the ongoing World\nHealth Assembly in Geneva, where Health Minister Dr Mongkol Na Songkhla\nis defending his country's case. \"International supporters have entered\nthe debate, saying that they will support Thailand on the issue in every\nway,\" he told the state-run Thai News Agency (TNA).\n\n\"International organizations belonging to the Third World Network, as\nwell as national groups from Brazil, Germany, India, Malaysia and the\nPhilippines, had met with him and praised Thailand on the issue,\" added\nTNA.\n\nMongkol now is reported to be planning to enforce compulsory licensing\nfor cancer drugs. The pros and cons are being studied of issuing\nlicenses for a group of cancer drugs that are still under patent in\nThailand.\n\nThailand's determination to use available provisions in international\ntrade to break patents emerged late last year, when Bangkok broke the\npatent on the ARV Efavirenz, produced by the US pharmaceutical giant\nMerck Sharp and Dhome. That was followed by a compulsory license issued\nhere for Kaletra, another ARV produced by the US pharma multinational\nAbbott Laboratories. In January, the patent for Plavix, a blood-thinner\nmade by Sanofi-Aventis, was broken.\n\nBut it was only Abbott that hit back at Thailand's use of the special\nprovisions under the World Trade Organization (WTO) for developing\ncountries to break patents on drugs when faced with a public-health\nemergency. In March the US multinational refused to register seven new\ndrugs here, including Aluvia, a drug that can be easily stored in\ntropical climates.\n\nAbbott's hopes of steamrolling over Thailand were dealt a blow last week\nfrom a quarter close to home - the foundation of former US president\nBill Clinton. At a ceremony in New York, with the Thai health minister\nMongkol by his side, Clinton endorsed Bangkok's decision to break the\npatents on the life-prolonging ARVs.\n\n\"No company will live or die because of high-price premiums for AIDS\ndrugs in middle-income countries, but patients may,\" Clinton said during\nan event that announced the foundation's success at further slashing the\nprice of second-line drugs, such as Abbott's Kaletra and Aluvia.\n\nWhile last month Abbott announced that it had reduced the price of\nKaletra in Thailand to US$1,000 for an annual course per patient, from\nthe $2,200 for the same course it had charged a month before, the\nClinton Foundation announced that it had an even cheaper offer. Matrix\nLaboratories, an Indian drug maker, was producing the generic version of\nAluvia for $695 for a one-year course.\n\nThailand's leadership in securing better care for its HIV and AIDS\npatients is in keeping with other pioneering efforts it has embraced to\ndeal with the killer disease. The Southeast Asian country has more than\n600,000 people infected with HIV and has recorded 300,000 deaths due to\nAIDS, the disease HIV causes.\n\n\"We have to stand up to the pressure from the pharmaceutical companies\nand the US,\" said Jiraporn Limpananont, associate professor in the\npharmaceutical science faculty at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.\n\"If more countries issue compulsory licenses, it will get the point\nacross that this is the right tool for developing countries.\"\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
