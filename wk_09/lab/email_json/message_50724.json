I carried out your steps and it works.  I \nstill don't think that software speech under Linux is all that impressive. \nAccording to my experiences, it is somewhat slow and often dies completely \nif a lot of text is sent to it too quickly.  Could be just my hardware but \nothers have had similar experiences.\n\nIn the espeak-generic.conf file, should I have left it creating wav files in \nthe command line parameter?  I took that out so that text was sent to the \nespeak application directly; seems to me that making wav files would just \nslow the process down even more.\n\nThanks,\nRobby\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Gregory Nowak\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Monday, June 18, 2007 3:28 PM\nSubject: Re: Problems with Software Speech\n\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> It seems you may be running into a similar problem which I reported\n> happens when switching synths with the doubletalk pc driver built into\n> the kernel, and set as the default.
