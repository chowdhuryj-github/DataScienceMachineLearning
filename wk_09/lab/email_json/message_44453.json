My next objective is to install R in the Linux environment, unfortunately Mandriva is not one of the Linux distributions available for download...

Compiling R was my first shot at compiling programs when I was \nnew to Linux, and it was not very difficult. It is described nicely in \nthe R Installation Administration Manual.\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html\n\nBasically, you only need to take care of the following steps to get you \nstarted:\n- did you download and unpack the source distribution (see section 1.1 \nof the manual)?\n- do you have the required tools installed (see section A.1 of the \nmanual)? (C compiler, Fortran compiler, libreadline, libjpeg, libpng, \ntex/latex, Perl5, xorg-x11-dev)\n- compilation (see section 2.1 in the manual)\n\nI hope this helps?\n\nBest,\nRoland\n\n\n\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
