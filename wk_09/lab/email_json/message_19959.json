According to a four-year clinical\ntrial, there's [0]a direct link between cancer and Vitamin D deficiency.\n\"[The] trial involving 1,200 women, and found those taking the vitamin\nhad about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with\nthose who didn't take it, a drop so large \\u2014 twice the impact on cancer\nattributed to smoking \\u2014 it almost looks like a typographical error. And\nin an era of pricey medical advances, the reduction seems even more\nremarkable because it was achieved with an over-the-counter supplement\ncosting pennies a day. One of the researchers who made the discovery,\nprofessor of medicine Robert Heaney of Creighton University in Nebraska,\nsays vitamin D deficiency is showing up in so many illnesses besides\ncancer that nearly all disease figures in Canada and the U.S. will need\nto be re-evaluated.
