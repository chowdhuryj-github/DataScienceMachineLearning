The description for\nthe error code  is rather vague on the msdn website. Any ideas why this\ncould be happening?\n\nThx,\nMurali\n\n-- \nRgds,\nMurali Bashyam\n(c) (510)6736915\n\n----------------------------- CONFIDENTIAL  --------------------\n*****************************************************\nThis telecommunication and any data attached to, or included in it\nis considered confidential, and is intended only for use by the named\nrecipient.
