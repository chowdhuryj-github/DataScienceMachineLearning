I don't have a synth and will be needing\none for my networking course I'll be taking next year. For this purpose,\nI'll need an external synth and don't really know anything about each\ndectalk or double talk. I can easily borrow one, but first I'd like to\nknow which one would be more recommended. First I'll be doing installs\nof Suse 9.x or maybe 10.x not sure yet, and netware. I am not sure if I\nneed special screen reading software that is always built into a kernel\nsuch as speakup for double talk or dectalk to always work. I was just\nchecking mail and saw someone received their double talk in the mail and\nsaid they'd try an install of slackware. I have no idea how slackware is\nwith accessibility, but I really need help on a decision before\nseptember and what I should look into borrowing.\n\n  Does this mean that either one of these will work in reading text\nallowed even if no special software is installed? I couldn't imagine\nthis one but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWhich port is more commonly used, serial or USB? I can't use an internal\ndouble talk pc since I'll be moving from station to station most likely\nand will want something portable. I have widdled it down to these two,\nbut please let me know if there are any better alternatives. Basically I\nwant to be able to take it out of the box, plug it in, and be able to\nboot my pc, and have speech be spoke with as little issues as possible\nand from what I hear, double talk is probably the way to go on this one.\n\nThanx,\nCody\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
