Using gitI have been having difficulty installing git on windows.\u00a0 Does anyone have any instructions I can use to download and set it up?\u00a0 Alternatively is there anyway to use git on the olpc itself, does anyone have those instructions?\u00a0 Alternatively is there any other way to to retreive activities that other people have created from the olpc code repository?\u00a0 At this time I am most interested in testing out the chat activity because I want to reuse some of the code for an activity I have been working on\n2.\u00a0 Memory problemsWe have been seeing a significant number of bugs and poor performance in the activity we are working on due to memory problems.\u00a0 For example, we are preloading an array of 26 images ~32K each and this crashes on the olpc.\u00a0 We are experimenting with using smaller file sizes and other methods but I was wondering if anyone has ideas for dealing with memory allocation in python or other possible workarounds.\u00a0 \nThanks~ Aneto-- Aneto OkonkwoBS Management Science & EngineeringMA Education: Learning, Design & TechnologyStanford University\noaneto@stanford.edu650.906.3961 (M)\n"}
