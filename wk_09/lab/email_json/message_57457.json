Options are passed as anonymous\nhashes.  Basically, we want to be able to do something like:\n\nperl t/codingstd/perlcritic.t --list\n--policy=CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs=>{'allow_leading_tabs'=>0}\n\nand it to give the output:\n\nCodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs => \\{\n   'allow_leading_tabs' => 0\n }\n\nSuch that the option of *not* allowing leading tabs is passed on to perlcritic.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul\n\n"}
