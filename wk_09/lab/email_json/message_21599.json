The fact that it impacted Digg's policies and \nhas generated so much publicity demonstrates how important this issue is \nto people.  This is a key that can be used to unlock the harmful \nanti-interoperability used by some copyright holders to impose \nhardware/software choices on their audiences.  Opposing this imposition \nseems to resonate with many people.\n\n   As interesting as the media attention is, I don't know if any long-term \npositive impact can come out of it if it doesn't translate into political \naction.  We have a petition that deals specifically with this issue that \nhas thus far only a little over 200 signatures to it.  If a fraction of \nthe Canadians who were likely involved in that Digg storm were signing and \ngetting all their friends to sign our petition, we could have a major \nimpact.\n\n   So far we haven't had the impact we could if we could leverage the \nnumber of people who seem concerned.\n\n\n   Politicians are only hearing one side of the story.  They hear from \nincumbent content industry associations who see all new media (the \ntechnology, as well as the new incentive models such as peer production or \nuser generated content) as a threat.  They hear from the US government \nagencies (USTR, USPTO, US embassy) acting as if they were part of the \ncontent industry lobby.  The bogus Special 301 report seems to be \nreceiving traction, and Canada seems to be wanting to appease these folks.\n\n   Our politicians barely hear from us, and thus are unaware of the massive \nharm to Canadian creativity and innovation that results from the types of \npolicies these incumbents are pushing.\n\n   They need to hear from us.  Petitions are one way, as is escalating \nthrough meeting with MPs.  Send them a letter, and ask to meet with them. \nIf you don't have time to meet with them, then ask your MP if they would \nbe willing to meet with me.\n\n\n\n   Any other thoughts on how to move things forward?  Things seem quiet at \nthe moment, but we are likely to see a new Copyright bill very soon which \nis rumoured to make C-60 look great in comparison.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n-- \n  Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n  Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n  rights as owners of Information Technology.
