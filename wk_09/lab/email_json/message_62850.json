If you want to\nuse string eval, first look for any possible way to avoid it.  If you\ncan't find a solution that doesn't use string eval, then ask the list.\n There are very few legitimate cases where string eval can be used,\nand even those are dangerous and full of traps for the unwary.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
