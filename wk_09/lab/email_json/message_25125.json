(x1-x2)^2 is non-negative for\nall x1, x2.  All points of the form (x, 1-x) where x is between 0 and 1\nsatisfy the constraints and achieve a function value of 0.  Hence, all\nsuch points are solutions.\n\nThere is no problem.  Except if there are further constraints that\nreduce the set of possible solutions which you have not told us about.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tBerwin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
