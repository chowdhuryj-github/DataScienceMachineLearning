Add \"customer_name is not null\" to the\nwhere clause.  Fetching data you are not going to use is unkind to the\ndatabase, the network, and your program.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
