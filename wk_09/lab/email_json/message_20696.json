Thailand is a county with under $3,000 GDP per capita\n(compared to over $40,000 in the U.S>), and an AIDS rate over twice as\nhigh as the U.S. (1.5% vs. 0.6% in the U.S.).\n\n\n\nOne measure of comparative affordability that includes universal\ntreatment goals looks to prices adjusted for BOTH GDP/capita and the\nprevalence of the disease in the target country.  This measure\njustifiably assumes that the goal of universal access will require lower\nprices in countries that are particularly hard hit by a given health\ncondition.\n\n\n\nThailand is a pretty clear example of how low prices need to be to\naccomplish universal access in hard hit countries.\n\n\n\nEven using the price for Thailand most recently offered by Abbott,\nalbeit not yet accepted by the Thais ($1,000 per patient per year), the\nprice is about 10 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE U.S. price adjusted for GDP per\nperson with AIDS.\n\n\n\nIf the price of Kaletra in the US was the same percentage of GDP per\ncapita with AIDS as it is offered by Abbott in Thailand, the U.S. price\nwould be $41,924, not including the 2-3 other medicines needed to create\na fully effective AIDS treatment cocktail.  Conversely, if Thailand paid\nthe same amount of its GDP per capita with AIDS as the U.S. does, the\nprice in Thailand would be $93 /year.\n\n\n\nTo get to $93 a year, past experience with first-line AIDS drugs\nsuggests that robust competition among generic suppliers (which have\nreduced the cost of a first-line complete cocktail from over $10,000 to\nunder $200 a year in 7 years), not unilateral price cuts by a\nmonopolist, will be the only effective driver towards affordability.  If\nThailand acts in a way that protects its future interests as well as its\npresent, it will reject Abbott's offer and help create a competitive\nglobal market for second-line AIDS drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per Capita\n\nUS          $41,948\n\nThailand    $2,751\n\n\n\nGDP per Person with AIDS\n\n      $13,070,005\n\n      $309,884\n\nPrice per person with AIDS\n\n      $4,586\n\n      $1,000\n\nPrice as % of GDP per capita\n\n      10.9%\n\n      36.4%\n\nPrice as % of GDP per PWA\n\n      0.03%\n\n      0.32%\n\n\n\nThe Population and GDP data are from the World Bank and the\n\nnumber of people with HIV/AIDS is from the CIA World Factbook.  The US\n\nprice is the 2006 Average Wholesale Price as published in the Red Book.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
