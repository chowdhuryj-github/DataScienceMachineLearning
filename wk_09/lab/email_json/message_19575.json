Copyright law is\nnot distributed by Debian, and needs no exception.\n\nSecond, what will happen in practice is that there will be text that is so\nshort and functional that it can't be copyrighted.  Example: package is under\nthe GPL.  The FSF then says \"you can reuse the text of the GPL as long as\nyou change the name\".\n\nThere's no infinite regress, because \"you can reuse the text of the GPL as\nlong as you change the name\" isn't copyrightable.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
