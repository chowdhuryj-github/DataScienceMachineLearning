(It will take me a full week to burn the \n307 copies needed) My editor (wife) is still working her way through the \nweb pages fixing my mistakes.\n\nThis DVD will include dozens of complete examples of art and free \nexpression which have been suppressed due to copyright laws. Many of \nthem are Canadian. The intent is to illustrate to ours Parliamentarians \nsome of the real social costs of overly strong and broad copyright laws; \nand warn them away from making them even stronger and broader.\n\nAt present I do not plan on making the media content publicly available. \nI want to limit my liability some what. I will mail a physical DVD to \nanyone who wants one, and I have the text of my own commentaries \navailable online at http://dvd.moores.ca\n\nIf you or anyone you know would like a physical copy, complete with \ncopyright violating derived works, please email me your postal address. \nI will mail out copies to anyone you supply me an address for.\n_______________________________________________\nDiscuss mailing list\nDiscuss@list.digital-copyright.ca\nhttp://list.digital-copyright.ca/mailman/listinfo/discuss\n\n"}
