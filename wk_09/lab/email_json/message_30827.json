Is there any \nreason, why we can't get rid of the const_too flag and just use the read \nonly machinery?\n\n2:  Is there a use case where a pmc would use just one, but not both of \nthe flags noinit and abstract?\nI'm trying to simplify where possible.  These two flags seem synonymous \nto me.\n\n\nThanks,\nKevin\n\n"}
