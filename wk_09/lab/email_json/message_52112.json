Of course it is \nbetter to keep the amount of different licences low (to \nease \"share-alike\" handling) - but maybe you have an idea for an \nattractive \"lable\" to tag educational stuff with:\n\nSuggestions:\nEducative Commons / Teaching Commons / Free Knowledge / Public Heritage\n...\n\nRegards\nRalf\n\nP.S.: Thinking about it, an extension of the BY-tag could make sense, \nclaiming the naming of the parent version and of its first anchestor \nlike this: Derived from , based on the work .\nThis makes it easier to keep track of great amounts of variations of a \nwork sheet (which might make sense in Math exams for instance).\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
