I knew it must be\nsimple!!!  What does the 0 column represent?\n\nAlso, does this tell me the same thing, filtered by Japan?\n> table(table(d$filename, d$email_addr, d$country_residence)[d$country_residence==\"Japan\"])\n\n  0   1   2   3\n958   5   2   1\n\nHow does that differ logically from this?\n\n> table(table(d$filename, d$email_addr)[d$country_residence==\"Japan\"])\n\n 0  1  2  3\n51  4  2  1\n\nI don't understand why that produces different results.  The first one\nadds a third dimension to the table, but limits that third dimension\nto a single element, Japan.  Shouldn't it be the same?  And again,\nwhat's that zero column?\n\nThank you,\nMatt\n\n\nOn 6/18/07, jim holtman  wrote:\n> If you are running on windows, make sure you have 'recording' checked in the\n> history window of the graphics.
