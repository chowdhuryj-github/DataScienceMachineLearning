New steps should continue to  \ndefine\nthis method.\n\n=item L\n\nThis method is called to actually execute the step.  The global\nL is passed is as the first parameter.  The return  \nvalue is\nundefined.\n\nI In the near future the return value of this method will be  \nsignifigant\nand there will be a means of passing additional parameters.\n\n\nThese remarks suggest that some additions to the functionality of the  \nargs and runstep method (@args is really an exported variable) would  \nbe forthcoming.\n\nDoes anyone know if we have plans to develop that functionality?  If  \nnot, then docs/configuration.pod should be revised appropriately?\n\nkid51\n\n\nBelow:  the svn log listing from the point where these paragraphs  \nwere added:\n\nr10960 | jhoblitt | 2006-01-07 10:41:22 -0500 (Sat, 07 Jan 2006) | 6  \nlines\n\nupdated to reflect:\n     - steps being split into their own namespaces\n     - a Parrot::Configure object being passed to each step\n     - CLI and configuration data each have their own  \nParrot::Configure::Data obj\nect\n     - minor formatting, style, and spelling corrections\n\n"}
