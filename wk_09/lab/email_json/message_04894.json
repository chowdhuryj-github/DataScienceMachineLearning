That is my XSf data frame. Unfortunately\nwhether I include that option(XSf) as in p or not as in q I get the same\nresult from predict in this case. I have confirmed that \"predict\" works\nproperly for the output of \"lm\" \n\np<-predict.systemfit(fitsur,XSf)\nq<-predict.systemfit(fitsur)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
