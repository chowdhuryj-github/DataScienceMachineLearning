Boca \nRaton: Chapman & Hall/CRC. (see also )\n\nSee also my reply to Lucia Costanzo and my suggestion to use the  \nMiMa-package  \n. \n\nHTH,\n\nBernd\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
