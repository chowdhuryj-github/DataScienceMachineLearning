Peter Pace.\n\nPrevious plans to close Guantanamo ran into resistance from Cheney, Gonzales and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. But officials said the new suggestion is gaining momentum with at least tacit support from the State and Homeland Security departments, the Pentagon and the Intelligence directorate.\n\nCheney's office and the Justice Department have been against the step, arguing that moving \"unlawful\" enemy combatant suspects to the U.S. would give them undeserved legal rights.\n\nThey could block the proposal, but pressure to close Guantanamo has been building since a Supreme Court decision last year that found illegal a previous system for prosecuting enemy combatants. Recent rulings by military judges threw out charges against two terrorism suspects under a new tribunal scheme.\n\nThose decisions have dealt a blow to the administration's efforts to begin prosecuting dozens of Guantanamo detainees regarded as the nation's most dangerous terror suspects.\n\n--!>           \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
