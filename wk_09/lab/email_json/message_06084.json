(apt-cache show cdrecord\nis your friend)\n\nalso, i think there are some issues that are found to be important:\n - gdm overlaps xorg.conf\n - hwclock issue.\n\nbest regards\n\nLuis Matos\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
