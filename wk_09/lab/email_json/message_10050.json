ASSEMBLY COMPETITIONS NOW OPEN: $36,000 in prizes\n\nClaim your piece of the $36,000 prize purse up for grabs in the Apollo Reporting System and Credit Analysis Tool assembly contests! With a two week submission period, recommended team sizes of between 2 and 4 members, these two applications are an excellent opportunity to get involved in producing top-quality software. \n\nAbout Credit Analysis Tool:\nThe application is a web-based .NET application and is critical to improving controls and efficiency within a leading energy services company. The Credit Analysis Tool will provide an easy-to-use application that provides a simple workflow component to the credit request and approval process. \n\nAbout Apollo Reporting System:\nThe Reporting System replaces a manual process whereby customers place an order for 1 or more reports, which are then written and reviewed by several internal departments before being published and/or delivered to the customer. TopCoder is helping automate this entire process with the Reporting System, which is both a web-based management interface for report order tracking and for the back-end processor.\n\n\n=================================================================\n4. TESTING COMPETITIONS NOW OPEN: $9,000 IN PRIZES\n\nTopCoder is excited to announce 6 new testing competitions with $1,500 each testing competition in prize money.
