I would too and I like linux.\n\nOther people have suggested building a dual boot system and that's probably \nfine. But I think you should get your own computer. If you're running \nspeakup, you can get by with a 1 Ghz machine or even less if you have a \nhardware synth.  Join a linux users group in your  area. Those nerds will be \nable to help you assemble a system for practically nothing. If you get 4 or \n5 linux nerds together in one place, they can assemble a machine out of \nspare parts in nothing flat.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Keith Hinton\" \nTo: \nSent: Friday, June 22, 2007 3:03 AM\nSubject: A computer issue, how should I deal with this?
