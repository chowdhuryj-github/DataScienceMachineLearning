The various options \"open\", \"print\", \"printto\" would \nnormally be stored there, for example with\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AcroExch.Document\\shell\\open\\command\n\nset to\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat 5.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe\" \"%1\"\n\n(on my system).  The trouble with this kind of editing is that programs \ncould instead install CLSID values, and then you won't see the \"open\", \n\"print\", \"printto\" choices.\n\nBefore you make changes to these things with regedit, I'd recommend \nexporting the branch so you can restore it if things go badly.\n\nDuncan\n> \n> \n> I am guessing that Adobe Reader 8 (a read-only program) saw that\n> Adobe Acrobat 6 (a read/write program) was installed.
