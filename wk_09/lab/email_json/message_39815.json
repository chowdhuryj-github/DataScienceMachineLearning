If I want to restore the \npre-function call .Random.seed, I can do:\n\nsave.seed<-.Random.seed\nresult<-myfunction()\n.Random.seed<-save.seed\n\nIs there a way to do the restoration inside the function?  I tried putting \nthe \"save.seed<-.Random.seed\" and \".Random.seed<-save.seed\" statements \ninside the function, but that didn't work.  Perhaps there's some clever way \nto use environment() functions?  (I confess I still haven't grasped those \nvery well.)  Also, the help section on .Random.seed mentions that some of \nthe random number generators save their state differently.  Does each random \ngeneration method have a way to restore its state?\n\nThanks!\n\n--  TMK  --\n212-460-5430\thome\n917-656-5351\tcell\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
