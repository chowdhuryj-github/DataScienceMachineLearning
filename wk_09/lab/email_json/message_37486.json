A gunshot is the perfect way.\nWe do not look in our great cities for our best morality.\nThe only legitimate artists in England are the architects.\nA book worth reading is worth buying.\nAction is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.\nNever find fault with the absent.\nWe all know that sponges grow in the ocean but I wander how much deeper the ocean would be if that wasn't the case.\nThe old believe everything the middle aged suspect everything, and the young know everything.\nA lot of what acting is paying attention.\nDanger past, God forgotten.\nDiaper backward spells repaid. Think about it.\nYouth is a blunder, manhood is a struggle and old age a regret.\nEvery man is a volume if you know how to read him.\nEvery man is a volume if you know how to read him.\nPeople want riches they need fulfillment.\nThe physician can bury his mistakes, but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines.\n\u00a0"}
