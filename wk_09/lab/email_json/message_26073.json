Existence is elsewhere.\nThe advice of the elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books.\nWhat is a city, but the people true the people are the city.\nTo me -- old age is always ten years older than I am.\nI want to put a ding in the universe.\nThe owl of ignorance lays the egg of pride.\nWith the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding. [Job 12:12]\nNothing is interesting if you are not interested.\nNothing is so good as it seems beforehand.\nDon't just read the easy stuff. You may be entertained by it, but you will never grow from it.\nYou know that the Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, are now extinct.\nThe Buddhas do but tell the way it is for you to swelter at the task.\nThe aeroplane has unveiled for us the true face of the earth.\nHe conquers twice who conquers himself in victory.\nOne of the most striking signs of the decay of art is when we see its separate forms jumbled together.\nIf we cannot end our differences at least we can make the world safe for diversity.\nEvery uneducated person is a caricature of himself.\n\u00a0"}
