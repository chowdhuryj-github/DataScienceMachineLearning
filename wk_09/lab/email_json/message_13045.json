It sounds\nlike you're trying to install Parrot using apt. If that is the case,\nyou may want to try building from a release tarball or checking out a\ncopy using subversion (instructions available here:\nhttp://www.parrotcode.org/source.html ).\n\nAlternatively, it'd be great if you wanted to try to figure out the\ncause of the issue (using gdb). There is usually someone around on\nirc.perl.org#parrot who could help you debug if you need it.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n-- \nMatt Diephouse\nhttp://matt.diephouse.com\n\n"}
