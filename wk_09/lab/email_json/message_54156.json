The reason I suggested FAT32 was\nbecause I thought NTFS was still read only on linux but\nGreg pointed out it's now possible\n\nhttp://www.ntfs-3g.org/\n\nI have had many a FAT32 file corruption over the years\nbut so far not one NTFS. OMG maybe microsoft did\nsomething fairly decent. hehe\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
