I don't _think_ I'm opposed, but maybe I am.\n The main case that I can see this limiting me is where I like to put\nmy error conditions at the end of my code, out of the way, like so:\n\n    unless $.something {\n        $.something = UsefulData.new;\n    }\n    else {\n        die \"Something exists!\";\n    }\n\nI don't want to switch the order of those blocks, and switching the\ncondition to \"if !$.something\" defeats the whole purpose of unless.\n\nLuke\n\n"}
