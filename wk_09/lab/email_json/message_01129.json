Somehow, I don't see it in the documentation. Would you please provide some examples? (3) If I would like to diagnostic of model selection, says use AIC criteria, it is a bit unclear for me how I can apply this on structural equation model as it is composed of multiple equations rather than one. And is there any functionality in sem that does this? Any help would be really appreciated.
