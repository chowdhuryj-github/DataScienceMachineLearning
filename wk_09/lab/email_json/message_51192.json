As it is, if a user \nwants to run speakup and BrlTTY, there could be a problem with both \nprograms wanting to share the same devices.\n\nTHere has in fact been discussion on the BrlTTY mailing list about \nextending BrlTTY to have speech/screen reader via keyboard \nfunctionality. Patches would be accepted for BrlTTY to do this.\n- -- \nLuke Yelavich\nGPG key: 0xD06320CE \n\t (http://www.themuso.com/themuso-gpg-key.txt)\nEmail & MSN: themuso@themuso.com\nJabber: themuso@jabber.org.au\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGePnGjVefwtBjIM4RAnMNAJ43ASbKihiYyojkrDJLvfC4WdMCWgCgjCXf\nslLR/lzF7/uHbYGy9Cpgl5E=\n=xftW\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
