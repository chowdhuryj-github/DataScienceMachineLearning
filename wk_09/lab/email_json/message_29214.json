The creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything.\n\nYou can't create experience. You must undergo it.\n\nThe empire of custom is most mighty.\n\nI think, therefore I am is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches.\n\nAction itself, so long as I am convinced that it is right action, gives me satisfaction.\n\nPromise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement.\n\nThe old know what they want the young are sad and bewildered.\n\nThe moment of enlightenment is when a person's dreams of possibilities become images of probabilities.\n\nThe wrath of brothers is fierce and devilish.\n\nProper names are poetry in the raw. Like all poetry they are untranslatable.\n\nBeware of silent dogs and still waters.\n\nThe Goddamn human race deserves itself, and as far as I'm concerned it can have it.\n\n\n"}
