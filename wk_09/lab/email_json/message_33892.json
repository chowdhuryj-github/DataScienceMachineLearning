I put the source tree in the\nright place, made a symbolic to it from /usr/src/linux, ran my old\ncheckout script, and got this:\n\nPatching version v26\nCVSROOT not set.  Enter it below.  Hit enter for anonymous.\nCVSROOT>\nLogging in to :pserver:anonymous@fl.linux-speakup.org:2401/usr/src/CVS\nCVS password:\n/usr/src/CVS: no such repository\n\n\nAnybody see the problem here? Not sure what to try next.\n\nThanks,\nChuck\n\n-- \nThe Moon is Waxing Crescent (30% of Full)\n You can get downloads from http://www.mhcable.com/~chuckh/software.html\n The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.467 / Virus Database: 269.7.6/814 - Release Date: 5/21/2007\n2:01 PM\n \n\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.467 / Virus Database: 269.7.6/814 - Release Date: 5/21/2007\n2:01 PM\n \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
