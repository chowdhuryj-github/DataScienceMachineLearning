I found the configuration file for speechd-up in Gentoo:\n/etc/conf.d/speechd-up\nNow: Here is what the file looks like:\n# /etc/conf.d/speechd-up: config file for /etc/init.d/speechd-up\n\n# Niceness level at which to run speechd-up\n\nNICELEVEL=-5\n\nDONTINITTABLES=1\n\nI do not know if that will actually work. Could someone please look at my syntax and instruct me to weather I did that wrong?\n\nThe point is for the dontinittables 1 option to be activated on all system boot-ups.\n\nRegards,\n\n--Keith\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
