An example would be checking for a\nusername in /etc/passwd or /var/log/maillog. The string is in another file,\nsometimes a single field on a line by itself, sometimes in a line with\nother strings. Based on what I have seen online and what I have done in\nother scripts I can :\n\n\n1. slurp the file into a single string and then check for a match.\n\n2. read the relevent field from the file into hash keys and check for a\nmatch. \n\n3. Loop through the file line by line and look for a match. \n\n\nGenerally there are 1 - 2,000 strings, and 2,000 to 1,500,000 lines per file.\n\nI am wondering how these different methods may impact performance.  \n\nI hope I have been clear. \n\nTIA.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nKaryn Williams\nNetwork Services Manager\nCalifornia Institute of the Arts\nkaryn@calarts.edu\nhttp://www.calarts.edu/network\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
