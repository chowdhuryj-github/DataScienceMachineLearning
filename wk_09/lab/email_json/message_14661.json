It was designed for  \nhandling concurrent client connections to R, and minimizes the per- \nconnection startup time by pre-starting R and forking of processes as  \nrequests come in.  Each client can maintain a stateful connection, if  \ndesired.\n\n-G\n\n\n\nOn Apr 24, 2007, at 2:15PM , Markus Loecher wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> I am trying to avid the somewhat costly startup overhead of launching\n> a separate R executable for each \"client\" request on Linux.\n> My current architecture is such that My Java client explicitly calls\n> R in batch mode and passes it certain parameters.
