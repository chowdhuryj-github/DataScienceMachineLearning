All threads\nshare the same pid.  Threads let you share information between\nthem, which is it's selling point.\n\nThis is not true in parallel independent processes, BUT in that case\nyou cannot use shared variables to communicate, you need more\ncomplicated forms of IPC. (Inter-process-communication)\n\nUsually fork and exec is more efficient, so it should be the first\nchoice.\n\nzentara\n\n\n-- \nI'm not really a human, but I play one on earth.\nhttp://zentara.net/japh.html\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
