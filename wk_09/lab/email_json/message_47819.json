So $hash{undef} is equivalent to $hash{'undef'}.\n\nYou might also do something like this:\n\n  my $NULL;\n  print $hash{$NULL};\n\nHTH, Jenda\n===== Jenda@Krynicky.cz === http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz =====\nWhen it comes to wine, women and song, wizards are allowed \nto get drunk and croon as much as they like.\n\t-- Terry Pratchett in Sourcery\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
