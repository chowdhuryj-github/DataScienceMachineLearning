This may change in the future.\"\n\nSo as I understand it, missing() cannot refer to the arguments of\nfunction1 if it is used in an argument of subset()?  It seems to remain\na promising function for this situation regardless, but I'm not sure how\nI could implement it into the subset() arguments offhand.\n\n--\n\njared tobin, student research assistant\ndept. of fisheries and oceans\ntobinjr@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Duncan Murdoch [mailto:murdoch@stats.uwo.ca] \nSent: Thursday, June 14, 2007 11:28 AM\nTo: Tobin, Jared\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Using subset() in a user-defined function\n\nOn 6/14/2007 9:38 AM, Tobin, Jared wrote:\n> Hello,\n> \n> I'm having a problem with using subset() inside a function I'm\nwriting.\n> Ignoring everything else in the function, the problem can be \n> illustrated by (where master.frame is the data frame I'm using):\n> \n> \n> function1 <- function(arg1=\"\", arg2=\"\", arg3=\"\"){\n> \n> \ttemp.frame <- subset(master.frame, a == arg1 & b == arg2 & c ==\n> arg3)\n> \n> }\n> \n> \n> This works fine if the user specifies all arguments, but if any one or\n\n> more of the arguments isn't specified, say arg1 for example, the \n> subset is empty because subset() goes looking for values of a == \"\" in\n\n> master.frame, and there are none.

It does depend on\ndefaults for the args existing and not causing errors in the equality\ntests (it's not using shortcut evaluation).\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
