This is a plain English meaning of \"accompany\".\n\nYes, sorry, I was looking at distribution from the Bacula standpoint rather \nthan from a Debian distribution until I though this through last night. \n\nHowever, the \"strict\" interpretation would imply that the GPL is not fair (in \nthe sense of compaints about the Novell - Microsoft contract), because I can \ndistribute Bacula binaries because no where on any of the project sites do we \ndistribute OpenSSL, but then the strict definition says that you cannot \ndistribute Bacula because you have OpenSSL someplace on the distribution \ndisks, or on your servers.\n\n> \n> I have seen various FSF FAQs over the years that have claimed that\n> distributing binaries linked against OpenSSL is ok, but these FAQs have been\n> mute on the matter of distribution as part of an OS.  \n\nI haven't seen them, but that doesn't surprise me as I don't believe that FSF \never really wanted to prohibit linking against OpenSSL, and if they did, they \nhave clearly changed their minds since the GPL v3 permits it.\n\n> In recent times, it \n> appears that some Unix vendors such as Sun and Apple have also begun\n> distributing GNU software as part of systems whose cores are not licensed\n> compatibly with the GPL, with the FSF's tacit consent; that seems\n> ill-advised to me, but in any case the FSF's interpretations of the GPL\n> aren't binding on other copyright holders where those interpretations don't\n> follow logically from the text of the license.\n\nI'm not sure Sun and Apple are so ill-advised. While I admit that the strict \ninterpretion is possible and one never knows what a judge would decide, it is \nsort of like the possibility of a magic asteroid striking earth.  It is \npossible that an asteroid could strike earth, but it is so remote that it \ndoesn't make sense to work in caves rather than skyscrapers to try to avoid \nbeing killed.  In the case of the strict interpretation, IMO it is equally \nunlikely to create a court case, and in any case, the consequences would be \nrather minor -- simply remove OpenSSL.\n\n> \n> > By the way, just to be clear, I consider all this (not you guys but these \n> > license difficulties) to be a real pain.

Here is what I have just added to the \nLICENSE file -- hopefully it should be clear.  Here is a snippet from the \nLICENSE file ...\n\n...\nLicense:\nFor the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2\nthis code is listed under Copyright Free Software Foundation\nEurope e.V. A small part of the code (less than 20 files) is\ncopyrighted under the GPL by other people (FSF, Sun, ...).\n\nWhat follows is information from the authors of the code:\n\nLinking:\nBacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under the GPL.\nHowever, if configured with encryption Bacula does use the\nOpenSSL libraries which are, unfortunately, not compatible with\nGPL v2.  To the best of our knowledge these libaries are not\ndistributed with Bacula code because they are shared objects, and\nas such there is no conflict with the GPL according what I (Kern)\nunderstand in talking to FSFE, and in any case, for the code that\nI have written, I have no problems linking in OpenSSL (of course\nthis does not speak for the few files in Bacula that are\ncopyrighted by others).  If you take a more severe stance on this\nissue, and you are going to distribute Bacula, then simply do not\nuse the --with-openssl when building your package, and no use of\nOpenSSL even through dynamic linking will be included.\n...\n\n\n> \n> \n> > > So the question really is: how can we have Bacula in Debian, with SSL\n> > > support, but without that clause?  \n> \n> > This is apparently possible because GNUTLS seems to have an OpenSSL \n> > compatiblity layer.\n> \n> Not much of one, I fear...\n\nYes, and they don't have an official certification of their code as OpenSSL \ndoes, so I for one (and I suspect it applies even more to corporate users) \nwould much prefer to use OpenSSL -- at least at the current time.\n\n> \n> > The problem is that those third-party sources are linked into the Bacula \n> > binaries, and since they are licensed as GPL with no modifications, I \ncannot \n> > include them in a binary that has code that is licensed in a way that is \n> > incompatible with the GPL.

Since that is serious to me, \nand I am not a lawyer, and I have first hand experience in how \"illogical\" \n(IMO) judges can be, I prefer to avoid the problem and not modify the GPL.  \nSo now Bacula is all \"pure\" GPL with no modifications with my explanations in \nnotes rather than as modifications of the license.\n\n> \n> Cheers,\n> -- \n> Steve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\n> Debian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\n> vorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n> \n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
