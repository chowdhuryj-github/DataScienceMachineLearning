Insightful is supposedly spending a ton of time making\nS+ able to use all R code without modification.  It must be taking them\nlonger than expected because I though it was supposed to be released by\nthe second quarter.  I have a S+ license and I haven't heard any\nannouncement from Insightful.  Anyone have more of an update?\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Tom.O\nSent: Thursday, May 17, 2007 7:46 AM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] Is it possible to control R with S+?\n\n\nI am currently using S+, which is my company standard econometric\npackage, but unfortunately in some areas R has a lot more to offer in\nnice functions/libraries. Libraries I would like to use in S+. So I\nwould like to use the R functions by calling on R from S+. For example\nexport the data to be used in the R calculation in a temporary txt-file,\nand then S+ calls on R to start and read the txt file. R then executes\nthe function specified and then exports the results in another txt file\nwhich then S+ uploads. Is this possible? Or does anyone have another\nsolution?\n\nThanks Tom\n\n--\nView this message in context:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Is-it-possible-to-control-R-with-S%2B--tf3771485.h\ntml#a10662666\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n********************************************************************** * \nThis message is for the named person's use only.
