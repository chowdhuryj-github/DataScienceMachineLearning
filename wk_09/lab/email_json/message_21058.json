I installed the rt2500 module and when i restart my laptop, the laptop work very slowly.  So i type ifconfig ra0 down and my pc back to work well. I installed this driver with my old debian (sarge kernel 2.4) and all very good but in my new linux etch i have this problem.\n\ncheck with dmesg(1) and top(1) what's going on - likely top will show some \nprocess / kernel thread stealing ~99% CPU. If so, file a bugrep against the\nrt2500.\n\n--\npaolo\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
