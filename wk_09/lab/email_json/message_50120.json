If I understand it right,\nwe can ignore x2 (since it is a fixed value) and simply consider\nminimising x1 (instead of x1-x2).\n\nThen, denoting by P(u) the cumulative normal distribution function\nfor mean=0 and variance=1 (i.e. in R: pnorm(u,0,1)), and by Q(p)\nits inverse, corresponding to qnorm(p,0,1), we have (again if I\nhave understood right):\n\n  P((x1 - 0.0032)/x) = 0.7\n\nso\n\n  x1 = 0.0032 + x*Q(0.7)\n\nand therefore, since Q(0.7) > 0 and x must be positive, the value\nof x1 can be made as close to 0.032 as you please (but greater\nthan 0.032) by taking x small enough.\n\nHence there is no strictly minimising value of x, but the greatest\nlower bound of all possible values of x1 is 0.032.\n\nThen you can subtract x2.\n\nThe fact that there is no positive value of x which gives this\nbound as the value probably explains the failure of your optim()\nattempt.\n\nBest wishes,\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 18-Jun-07                                       Time: 17:46:01\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
