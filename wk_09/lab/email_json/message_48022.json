He plans to push the 4-inch by 6-inch blanket corner down and then use a surgical stapler to secure it to adjacent blankets. Both spacewalkers have time built into their schedule for additional solar array retraction work if necessary. A fourth spacewalk by Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson is scheduled for Sunday.\n\nThe P6 solar array was installed on the station in December 2000 to provide electrical power to U.S. systems during the early stages of assembly. Now that NASA is activating the station's permanent power system, P6 must be moved to the left end of the lab's solar truss.\n\nThat move is planned for later this year but first, the two 115-foot dual-blanket solar wings making up the P6 array must be retracted. One wing was stowed during a shuttle flight last December, but the astronauts ran into major problems and had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to coax the blankets back into their storage boxes.\n\nBuilding on lessons learned, the Atlantis astronauts began the retraction of the other side of the P6 array Wednesday using a slow, step-by-step approach to prevent the blind-like blankets from folding the wrong way or otherwise hanging up as their framework mast is pulled in.\n\nBefore Wednesday's spacewalk, the astronauts were able to retract the central mast some 28 feet before standing down for the EVA. Then, Forrester and Swanson, using custom insulated tools, freed blanket grommets from guidewires and helped ensure smooth folding, allowing the mast to be retracted another five bays or so for a total of about 45 feet.\n\nWorking inside the space station, the astronauts plan to carry out more bay-by-bay retraction attempts today. If any blankets hang up, the crew can re-extend the mast or jog it from side to side using motors that normally help the panels track the sun. Several so-called \"wiggle\" tests Wednesday set up enough rippling motion in the flexible blankets to free slats that had hung up on guide wires. The astronauts are hoping for more of the same today.\n\nHere is a timeline of today's activity (in EDT and mission elapsed time; includes rev. H of the NASA TV schedule):\n\nEDT........DD...HH...MM...EVENT\n\n06/14/07\n\n08:38 AM...05...13...00...STS/ISS crew wakeup\n11:38 AM...05...16...00...Station robot arm maneuvers to P6-2B retraction viewing\n11:38 AM...05...16...00...EVA-3: Procedures review\n11:38 AM...05...16...00...P6-2B retraction window opens\n12:28 PM...05...16...50...EVA-3: Tagup with mission control\n01:03 PM...05...17...25...EVA-3: Tools preparation\n02:18 PM...05...18...40...EVA-3: Repair practice\n03:03 PM...05...19...25...P6-2B retraction window closes\n03:03 PM...05...19...25...Post-EVA tool reconfig\n03:03 PM...05...19...25...Nitrogen transfer terminated\n03:18 PM...05...19...40...Post EVA-2 tools config\n03:33 PM...05...19...55...Crew meals begin\n04:18 PM...05...20...40...Spacesuit swap\n05:08 PM...05...21...30...Equipment lock preps\n05:58 PM...05...22...20...EVA-3: Tools configured\n06:00 PM...05...22...22...Mission status briefing on NTV\n07:13 PM...05...23...35...EVA-3: Tagup with mission control\n08:23 PM...06...00...45...EVA-3: Procedures review\n09:58 PM...06...02...20...Fox Radio, KMGH-TV, KUSA-TV crew interviews on NTV\n10:53 PM...06...03...15...EVA-3: Mack prebreathe and tool config\n11:48 PM...06...04...10...EVA-3: 10.2 depress\n\n06/15/07\n\n12:08 AM...06...04...30...ISS crew sleep begins\n12:38 AM...06...05...00...STS crew sleep begins\n01:00 AM...06...05...22...Daily video highlights reel\n\nDepending on how far the crew gets today, the flight plan includes time for additional retraction work Friday, when Olivas and Reilly stage the crew's third spacewalk.\n\nAtlantis is scheduled to undock from the space station next Tuesday around 10:40 a.m. But the Russian computer system must be operational before the shuttle departs. Protecting their options, NASA managers today asked the astronauts to implement power conservation measures to permit a possible additional docked day if necessary.\n\nAs of 10:25 a.m., the station's power system had been successfully reconfigured after Russian engineers re-established communications and the ability to command one computer in the guidance system and one in the command-and-control system. Engineers were hopeful about restoring two other systems to operation. But it's not yet clear what triggered the original problem and troubleshooting continues.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
