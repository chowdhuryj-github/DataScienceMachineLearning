Now comes redemption for the accused former college\n  students, Reade Seligmann, David Evans and Collin Finnerty. Prosecutors have\n  decided to drop all criminal charges against the young men, saying the\n  athletes were victims of a \u201ctragic rush to accuse\u201d by District\n  Attorney Mike Nifong \u2013 who himself is now under scrutiny. I\u2019ll\n  have that story and my colleagues will be with me in North Carolina covering all the angles.\n\u00a0\nThe rape accusation last spring has had widespread\n  ramifications \u2013 it has stoked racial tensions in the Raleigh-Durham\n  community, scarred three families and tarnished the reputation of one of the\n  country\u2019s top universities \u2013 but, as Bob Orr will report, the\n  legal case really was no case at all. \n\u00a0\nDespite that, the parents of the three accused men,\n  who are now 20, 21 and 24 years old, spent an estimated $3.5 million on\n  lawyers. All three are now vindicated, but are still victims. Byron Pitts\n  will take a look at how the accusation has changed the lives of the accused\n  young men and will tell us where they are now.\n\u00a0\nAnother reputation tarnished by the accusations was\n  that of one of the country\u2019s top higher education institutions: Duke University.\n  Kelly Wallace will take a look at the media glare that focused on Duke and\n  its lacrosse team for the past year and assess the impact of the accusation\n  on the campus and community.\n\u00a0\nAnd then we\u2019ll turn to the controversy over\n  on-air comments made by Don Imus about the Rutgers\n  women\u2019s basketball team. The radio host was suspended for two weeks\n  after making the remarks, but it is yet to be seen whether he will stay in\n  his position. But how much is he worth to his broadcasters and advertisers?\n  Anthony Mason will have the story.\n\u00a0\nFinally, I sat down with the family of Reid\n  Seligmann, one of the accused Duke lacrosse players. I\u2019ll share our\n  conversation with you tonight.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
