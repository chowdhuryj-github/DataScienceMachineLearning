Aubin\n[0]explains some of the process behind capturing satellite imagery for\nuse with the product. 'Most people are surprised to learn that we have\nmore than one source for our imagery. We collect it via airplane and\nsatellite, but also just about any way you can imagine getting a camera\nabove the Earth's surface: hot air balloons, model airplanes - even\nkites. The traditional aerial survey involves mounting a special\ngyroscopic, stabilized camera in the belly of an airplane and flying it\nat an elevation of between 15,000 feet and 30,000 feet, depending on the\nresolution of imagery you're interested in. As the plane takes a\npredefined route over the desired area, it forms a series of parallel\nlines with about 40 percent overlap between lines and 60 percent overlap\nin the direction of flight. This overlap of images is what provides us\nwith enough detail to remove distortions caused by the varying shape of\nthe Earth's surface.'\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/30/0237218\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.google.com/librariancenter/articles/0604_01.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| New Submarine Cable Planned Between SE Asia and US                 |\n|   from the keeping-us-in-the-loop dept.                            |\n|   posted by Zonk on Monday April 30, @00:07 (Communications)       |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/30/0330242              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nel_flynn writes \"BusinessWeek is reporting on [0]a new submarine cable\nsystem that will link South East Asia directly with the USA.
