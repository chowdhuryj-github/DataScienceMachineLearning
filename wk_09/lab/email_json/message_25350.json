It can fit the 1PL, 2PL, and 3PL models \nthrough a simple and unified syntax, using either the R package ltm, \nBrad Hanson's ICL program, or the commercially available BILOG-MG. The \npurpose is basically to facilitate teaching, and especially comparisons \nacross models and/or programs. Various graphs, item fit statistics, \nscaling methods, ability estimation, simulation facilities etc. are also \nincluded. Please notice that most options in estimating an IRT model are \nkept to the typical default values, and only a small, common subset of \nthe ltm, ICL, and BILOG syntax is supported. Comments are very welcome.\n\nIvailo Partchev\nInstitute of Psychology\nUniversity of Jena\nGermany\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
