For example, I want a function\ntemp.func() such that:\n\n>name = c( \"mike\", \"john\", \"steve\")\n>result = temp.func(name)\n> result\n        name\n1       mike\n2       john\n3      steve\n\nRight now I have the following code:\n\ntemp.func = function (x) {\n    x = as.data.frame(x)\n    return(x)\n}\n\nThe problem is, the above function returns the colname, \"factor(x),\" which\nis not \"name.\" Anyone has Any idea? \n\nLastly, I would like to thank everyone in this forum who helped me on\nanything I asked abour R. I really appreciate your help. Thank you. \n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/creating-a-function-tf3588133.html#a10027287\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
