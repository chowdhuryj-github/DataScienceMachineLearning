I've thought of a few changes\n> we can make; let me know if you see any problems with these:\n>\n> 1.  I will simplify the Rtools site.

You also suggested adding more tools to Rtools.exe.  I think the key\n> tool to add would be Perl; it's the only essential tool that's currently\n> missing.  Unfortunately, there are licensing issues with that for\n> ActiveState Perl, the version we currently recommend.

We could include the tools in the base installation of R; that's\n> what the MacOSX release has done.  However, that would at least double\n> the size of the download, even with just the minimal additions, and\n> under the GPL would require CRAN and its mirrors to host source for most\n> of the tools.  What I plan to do instead is to put a link to the Rtools\n> page on the CRAN page for the Windows R binary.\n\nSome other possiblities are:\n- use a different toolset.  I seem to remember that there were a few very\ncompact toolsets for use with minimal systems.  One basically put all\nthe UNIX tools in one executable and you could just rename it successively\nto each tool you wanted.  Another one used lua for implementation which\nis embeddable and very small.\n- rewrite as many tools as possible in R.  The full power of the tool might\nnot be needed making it easier.  If 80% of the tools could be easily eliminated\nit might not be a problem to include the remaining 20%.  Or if 20% of the\ntools take up 80% of the space this might be sufficient.  Of course getting\nthem all in R would be nice.\n\n>\n> 5.  We could modify the MkRules file that we distribute with R to assume\n> the minimal toolset, i.e. no LaTeX or CHM help.  This would mean you'd\n> get fewer \"not found\" messages from a basic install, but might be a\n> little inconvenient for people who have the tools.  Perhaps we can\n> detect whether those tools have been installed and act accordingly.\n>\n\nNot sure I understand this but could this be decided upon automatically\nby checking the user's registry for the existence of the tools?\n\n> 6.  You suggested avoiding changes to the toolset.  This is hard,\n> because the updates often fix bugs in older versions.  Bugs in the tools\n> lead to bugs in R.  So I think we don't have much choice but to continue\n> to make necessary updates.\n>\n> Duncan Murdoch\n>\n>\n> >\n> > Harold\n> >\n> >> -----Original Message-----\n> >> From: Duncan Murdoch [mailto:murdoch@stats.uwo.ca]\n> >> Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2007 3:51 PM\n> >> To: Doran, Harold\n> >> Cc: Gabor Grothendieck; r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> >> Subject: [SPAM] - Re: [SPAM] - Re: [R] R package development\n> >> in windows - Bayesian Filter detected spam - Bayesian Filter\n> >> detected spam\n> >>\n> >> On 5/3/2007 3:33 PM, Doran, Harold wrote:\n> >> > Thanks, Duncan.
