In other words, in the examples I \ncould only see applications of Moran's I related to a \"time-independent\" \ndistribution of data from any sample of stations.\n\nAnother question's coming up right now: if I change the sample of stations \nfor a future development, is there the chance to get an estimation of the \ndegree of spatial autocorrelation, given only the geographical location of \nthe sampling points ?\n\nThanks a lot for the attention !!!\n\nStef\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStefano Marchesi\nEnvironmental Epidemiologic Unit\nEnvironmental Protection Agency - ARPA Emilia Romagna\nVia Fontanelli 23 - 41100 Modena (Italy)\ntel: +39 059 433635 (int. 5035)\nfax: +39 059 241312\nsito web: www.arpa.emr.it/epam\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
