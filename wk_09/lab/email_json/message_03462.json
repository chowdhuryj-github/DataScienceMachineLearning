I figure out what I\nwant interactively and then separate the data management and analysis in\n.do-files, then run them in batch mode.\n\nHowever, when I first read of the approach of using Perl, sed or awk\nto manage data and then only doing the analysis in R, I immediately\nthought \"Wow, that is a really great idea, I never thought of it like\nthat before.\"  It would really get me to think about the modelling and\nthe data management clearly.  A little voice said \"Dude, you're not\nusing a PDP-11...(oh wait, that might be kinda cool)\" but the logic of\nit immediately made sense.  I consider it a big part of my\nre-Unix-ization.\n\nJoel\n\n-- \nJoel J.
