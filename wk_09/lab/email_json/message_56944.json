Write a function 'dropterm.mlm', copying 'dropterm.lm' and \nmodifying it as you think appropriate.  The function 'dropterm.lm' is \nhidden in a namespace, which you can see from 'methods(dropterm)'.  To \nget it, either use getAnywhere(\"dropterm.lm\") or \"MASS:::dropterm.lm\".\n\n      2.  Use 'stepAIC' in the univariate mode.  If they both select the \nsame model, it would strongly suggest that you would get the same answer \nfrom a multivariate version.  Fit that multivariate version and be happy. \n\n      3.  If univariate analyses produce different models and you want a \ncommon one, take the models you get, and interpolate manually a list of \nalternative plausible models between the two best univariate models.  \nThen fit those manually and select the one with the smallest AIC. \n\n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n\nvinod gullu wrote:\n> dear R users,\n>\n> I have fit the lm() on a mtrix of responses. \n> i.e M1 = lm(cbind(R1,R2)~ X+Y+0).
