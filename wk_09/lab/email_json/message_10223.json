An individual desktop (KDE theme) with stylish widgets and icons that \nmatch the taste of teenagers.\nSo far we use the default KDE desktop theme plus some 'cool' wallpaper.\n2. The web presentation has moved from a plone CMS to the debian wiki \n(http://www.skolelinux.org points to http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu). \nThe result is rather pale - decision makers need a mocked up show case \nto get convinced. \n\nDebian-Edu/Skolelinux 3.0 \"Terra\" (based on Debian Etch) is to be \nreleased this year. So there is your chance to  become famous in no \ntime ;)\n\nI will send a copy (XPost) to debian-edu mailing list - please proceed \nthere: debian-edu at lists.debian.org\n\nWith kind regards\nRalf\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
