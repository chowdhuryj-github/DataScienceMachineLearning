Please install cairo \n(http://www.cairographics.org/) and/or set CAIRO_CFLAGS/LIBS \ncorrespondingly.\n\nwhich has it's own library dependencies as well. Most all Linux \ndistributions (I'm presuming you're running Linux) have ways to install \nthese dependencies easily: apt-get, rpm, etc.\n\nOtherwise, if you had other problems installing Cairo, please let me \nknow and I can fix them.\n\nJeff\n\n> \n>> Thanks for the help\n>> Ulrik\n>>\n>> On 18/04/07, Henrik Bengtsson  wrote:\n>>> Or see png2() in R.utils, which imitates png() but uses bitmap(),\n>>> which in turn uses postscript-to-png via ghostscript.
