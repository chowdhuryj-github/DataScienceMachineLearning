and pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools.\u00a0  SCP Pool\u2019s customers include swimming pool remodelers and builders; retail swimming pool stores; and swimming pool repair and service companies.\nCurrent Outlook: Now let me tell you this stock concerned a lot of people when it dipped considerably earlier this month.\u00a0  But you know what I said in response?\u00a0  Buy more now!\u00a0  Considering this week it went up nearly 10% AND it\u2019s breaking the downtrend line on the weekly.\u00a0  Not to mention the monthly, where it\u2019s up almost 15%!\u00a0  So for goodness sakes, dip into this POOL, on the pullbacks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Attention Required!\nA few weeks ago, I wrote about a stealth bull market \u2014 a very powerful uptrend \u2014 that most investors know nothing about.\nAt the time I told you about one specific trade that had a great chance at doubling your money over the next 4\u20135 months.\nSince that time, this stock has already started its move \u2014 up 10% so far in April already!\nYou still have the opportunity to capture the lion\u2019s share of the profits\u2014but you MUST take action now.\u00a0  Click here to watch an important video message about this trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPPO: It\u2019s not just a medical plan\nWe\u2019ve gone over the first two indicators we use to identify trend reversals at Trending123\u2014the Aroon indicator and the Williams Percent Range (Williams %R).\u00a0  So what\u2019s the third?\u00a0  As it turns out, it\u2019s a three-letter abbreviation: PPO.\nPPO stands for percentage price oscillator.\u00a0  It\u2019s a lot like the MACD, but with one critical difference.\u00a0  Both indicators calculate the difference between a shorter-term moving average and a longer-term moving average, but where the MACD expresses it as an absolute value (dollars), the PPO expresses it as a percentage.\u00a0  For instance, a PPO of +5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% higher than the longer-term moving average.\u00a0  A PPO of -5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% lower than the longer-term moving average.\nBecause it\u2019s expressed as a percentage instead of as an absolute value, the PPO is much more reliable than the MACD, especially for long-term trends.\u00a0  And that\u2019s why we can use it to help identify trend reversals: When the PPO rises above zero, it\u2019s bullish, and when it falls below zero, it\u2019s bearish.\u00a0  Now isn\u2019t that as easy as 1, 2, 3?\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\nP.S.
