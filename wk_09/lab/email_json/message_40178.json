If you use extractAIC() on both systems,\ndo you get the same ordering of models?\n\nAIC() is also available on both systems, in the stats package again in\nR, and in the nlme3 library in S-PLUS.  On R there are not too many\nclasses where methods are available for both, but on S-PLUS there are a\nfew.\n\nSo what are you comparing with what?  You need to say what classes of\nobjects you are dealing with, that is very important, and what generic\nfunctions you are using for the comparison on each system.  The capacity\nfor confusion in this area is immense.\n\nBill Venables\nCSIRO Laboratories\nPO Box 120, Cleveland, 4163\nAUSTRALIA\nOffice Phone (email preferred): +61 7 3826 7251\nFax (if absolutely necessary):  +61 7 3826 7304\nMobile:                (I don't have one!)\nHome Phone:                     +61 7 3286 7700\nmailto:Bill.Venables@csiro.au\nhttp://www.cmis.csiro.au/bill.venables/\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Alice Shelly\nSent: Friday, 1 June 2007 10:07 AM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] AIC consistency with S-PLUS\n\nHello-\nI understand that log-likelihoods are bound to differ by constants, but\nif i estimate AIC for a set of simple nested linear models using the\nfollowing 4 methods, shouldn't at least two of them produce the same\nordering of models?\n\nin R:\nextractAIC\nAIC\n\nin S-PLUS:\nAIC\nn*log(deviance(mymodel)/n) + 2*p\n\nI find it troubling that these methods all give me different answers as\nto the best model or even short set of models.\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nAlice Shelly\n\n[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
