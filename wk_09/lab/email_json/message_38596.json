Note that\n\"any\" is considered a singular noun in English, and so used in\njunctional phrases like \"any of A, B, or C\", where it picks out\none or another of them semantically, which is basically the same\noperation that autothreading a parameter does.  We're using \"any\"\nmore in that \"any of a restricted set\" sense than in the \"any of\nthe universal set\" sense.\n\nSo I'm not too worried about the counterintuitiveness of it, by and\nlarge.  It's much like that little embarrassing problem in physics\nthat a GUT is neither as grand nor as unified as a TOE. :)\n\nIn any case, the Huffman coding is probably right because you want\nto declare Any parameters more often than you want to talk about any\npossible kind of Object, I suspect.\n\nHmm, maybe we should just rename Object to something more generic.\nThere are plenty of candidates:\n\n    Top\n    Idea\n    Noun\n    Item\n    Proto\n    Thing\n    Notion\n    Concept\n    Subject\n    Reality\n    Invocant\n    Universal\n    EveryThing\n    Abstraction\n    TheCosmicAll\n    Life::Universe::Everything\n\nLarry\n\n"}
