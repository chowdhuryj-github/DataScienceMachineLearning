Thus, the switch was an  \nattempt to remain  competative in the general market.\nWith the added bonus that you can now run windows on your mac (if you  \nso choose to ruin such a good machine)\nThat's the draw for most, a stable os that still allows execution of  \nall your legacy software just in case you absolutely can't do without  \nit.\nPersonally, I have booted into xp roughly 3 times in the last year,  \nso for me, the xp thing was only a nice to have, but definitely not a  \nnecessity.\n\nHowever, the conversion from ppc to intel went rather smoothly  \nconsidering it was an entire os that got ported over (I know, linux  \nis on several platforms and it works just fine) Well, now apple has  \nproved it can be done with a commercial os as well.\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 5, 2007, at 6:49 PM, Alex Snow wrote:\n\n> Kind of lost interest when they went intel\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
