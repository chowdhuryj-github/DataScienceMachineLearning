Mika does not support this; as the kernel lock\nbeing preempted should be something left alone, because this is eusually\nenabled across all normal current distrobutions of Linux. You should not\nhave any reason to use nice-levels, because once you make the following\nchange (I recommend installing on your hard-drive and booting back into\nthe installation of GRML first though) then make sure that you do this.\nIn make menuconfig (I will not explain how to do a compilation of the\nkernel) you should be able to find documentation on this, go to Processor\ntype and features, and then select either Preempt the big kernel lock (and\ndisable this completly) or totally deactivate  the preemption if you\nchoose.\nThen perform a make && make modules_install, and reboot the hard-drive\ninstallation, and you should be fine.\nBTW does anyone know if debian's ESpeak package uses \"speak?\" or the\nEspeak executable library?\nRegards, --Keith.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
