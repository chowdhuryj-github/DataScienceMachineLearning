I had been able to derive the\nclock times of each prediction.   I would now like to graph this data\nwith points showing heights as \"r\" and times as \"theta\", from 0000 to\n2355.  There is a seasonal component: I am interested in displaying\ntimes of lowest tides in particular.\n\nI am sure this is so simple as to burden those on the list; I however\nhave spent two evenings trying to figure out how to use polar.plot,\nand I'm not sure that's the best way to do this.  May I request some\nadvice?  The docs with polar.plot are not complete, I fear.\n\nThank you, begging for your indulgence,\n\nAlan\n\n-- \nAlan Davis, Kagman High School, Saipan  lngndvs@gmail.com\n\n\nEvery great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute\nrejection of authority.  ----- Thomas H.
