If you pass \n--jitcapable to Configure.pl it will override that hash so that the jit \nwill be included.  To \"untodo\" it at the moment, aside from fixing \nthem(which would require someone with that arch to update it), would be \nto delete the directory entirely, which is probably not the best \noption.\n\nTo me, the more annoying issue is the error message you get if you pass \n-j to parrot without jit, \"Error: PARROT_JIT_FLAG is set, but \ninterpreter is not JIT_CAPABLE!\"\n\n"}
