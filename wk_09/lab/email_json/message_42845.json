They claim that from May 1 until June 3,\nthey could not have access to the WSEAS Web Pages.  After this\nfeedback, we return to our former provider and we give prolongation\nfor the conferences AIC, ISCGAV and ISTASC until\nJune 30, 2007\n\nSee these emails at:\nhttp://www.wseas.org/connection-problems-in-china.htm\n\n\nWSEAS Post-Conference Report and Photos from Istanbul, Turkey:\nhttp://www.wseas.us/reports/2007/istanbul/index.html\n      \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES FOR THE WSEAS CONFERENCES OF AUGUST 2007\nwww.wseas.org\n\n\n1) Publication of the Proceedings in 3 media: hard-copy, CD, E-Library\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(A) Hard-Copy Proceedings (Book) with ISBN and ISSN indexed by the\nmajor Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes\n\n(B) CD-ROM Proceedings with pages' numbers with ISBN and ISSN \n    indexed  by the major Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes\n\n(C) E-Library:  http://www.wseas.org/online\n\nand possible:\n\n  (D) JOURNAL PUBLICATION: Authors of high - quality papers of\narchival value are invited to send extended versions of their papers\nto the international WSEAS Journals after the conference.
