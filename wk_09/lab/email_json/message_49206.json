If there is no CD \nthe hopefully there is floppy drive. Prepare or find a generic \nkernel for the floppy disk, and when booting, from the boot \nprompt, you'll need to do something like:\n\ngeneric-kernel-name root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd\n\nWhere generic-kernel-name is the name of the kernel on boot\ndisk and root points to the root filesystem partition on the \ntarget machine. Basically you want to boot the kernel on the\nfloppy but boot it using the root filesystem on the target hard\ndrive. Once the system is booted, compile a new kernel on \nthe p3 and update the bootloader accordingly to refer to the\nnew kernel.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
