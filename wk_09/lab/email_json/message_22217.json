A year ago, it gave judges\nmuch-needed flexibility in granting or denying permanent injunctions in\neBay. And this week it took another positive step in KSR v. Teleflex,\nwhich dealt with the design of the humble gas pedal but has far larger\nconsequences.\n\nIn striking down a Teleflex patent on a gas pedal, the High Court\nshowed how easily patent law can \"stifle, rather than promote\"\nprogress, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy's unanimous opinion.\nThe question was whether a pedal design patented in 2001 was nothing\nmore than an \"obvious\" combination of previously existing designs. The\ntrial court ruled it was obvious, and invalidated the patent. An\nappeals court overruled, but the Supremes sided with the trial court.\nIn doing so, the Justices rebuked the appellate patent court for having\nraised the bar too high in assessing \"obviousness.\"\n\nThis is important because it will help rein in what has become a\nproliferation of patents for increasingly small or dubious technology\nadaptations. This in turn is damaging innovation by throwing more and\nmore business decisions into patent court.\n\nFederal law requires that patents only be granted for non-obvious\ninnovations. This is because patents ought to protect inventions that\nrequire a discovery, a leap of logic or imagination. An example that\nJustice Kennedy cites in Teleflex is that of a battery that used an\nelectrode previously thought unsuitable for that purpose. An inventor\ndiscovered that the conventional wisdom was wrong, and a new type of\nbattery came into being.\n\nThe Teleflex gas pedal, by contrast, combined elements of existing\npedals in a way that neither defied the conventional wisdom nor\nresulted in novel, unexpected benefits. The fact that no one had\ncombined those elements in that particular way was not, the Court\nruled, sufficient to conclude that the combination merited a patent.\n\nMore broadly, Justice Kennedy wrote that the federal courts had adopted\ntoo strict a standard for invalidating patents. This could have broad\nramifications. Our patent system is only as good as the bureaucrats who\ngrant the patents and the courts that enforce them. So if a legal\nstandard allows dubious patents to be enforced, then innovation and the\neconomy may suffer.\n\nThis is the point overlooked by some of our libertarian friends, who\nargue that because property rights are good, and a patent is a kind of\nproperty right, then all patents must be good. But only a good patent\nis good -- that much should be obvious. A bad legal standard allows bad\npatents to be enforced against legitimate competitors, and it tells the\nfolks at the Patent Office to be less careful in issuing patents than\nthey should be.\n\nTeleflex is the latest in a series of cases that have tried to better\ndefine the proper limits and roles of patents. This is not partisan or\nideological work, and it won't get much attention in the next Supreme\nCourt confirmation fight. But it is vital to promoting innovation in a\ncompetitive economy, and is worth applauding.\n\n   \tURL for this article:\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB117815853947390467.html\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
