What were the failings of intelligence and did MI5 mislead MPs? \n\n\nHome Secretary, John Reid, speaking in the Commons has rejected calls for an inquiry into the 7/7 bombings. He's said MI5 are putting information on their website, and a parliamentary committee will look at the case again.\n\nRichard Watson reveals in astonishing detail how the 7/7 ringleader was being watched by MI5 and knew the bomb plotters. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis reminded the Commons today that the government said the bombings had come out of the blue. We hope to be getting answers tonight to the key questions following this trial. \n\n\nWe're hoping to speak to the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee that took evidence from MI5. We should also be joined by opposition politicians, an intelligence chief, a 7/7 victim and a Muslim community leader. And in the second part of his investigation for the programme tonight Richard Watson goes on the trail of the terror network in the UK and Pakistan, confronting the men suspected of organising it.  \n\n\nSee you at 10.30pm on BBC2. \n\n\nRobert\n\n\nMissed Newsnight Review?\n\nClick here to watch online\n\n\nMissed Newsnight?\n\nClick here to watch the latest programme online \n\n\nNewsnight Blog\n\nAdd your comments to our correspondents' blogs:\n\nCLICK HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
