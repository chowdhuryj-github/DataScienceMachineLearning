This will be driven by (at least) two issues.\nFirst, how much memory you have on your own computer and second what\ndata you have in each cell. For instance, an integer takes less memory\nthan a floating point.\n\nOther spreadsheet programs like excel limit the number of rows to 16^2\nirrespective of memory, but that is not true here.\n\nHarold\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Guanrao Chen\n> Sent: Friday, June 01, 2007 5:06 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] What is the maximum size of a matrix?\n> \n> hi, Rers\n> \n> I tried to find out the max size (# of rows, # of\n> columns) of a matrix that is allowed by R but failed.\n> \n> Can anybody let me know?\n> \n> Thanks!\n> Guanrao\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
