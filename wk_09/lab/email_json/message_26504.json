We are \n      finally experiencing the warm weather\u00a0we've all been \n      waiting\u00a0for.\u00a0And, while we had a great time today, we are\u00a0counting our blessings for \n      the folks in other parts of the country\u00a0who have been experiencing \n      severe weather conditions like the wildfires in Southern \n      California\u00a0and the floods in \n      Missouri. \n      \n\u00a0\nA \n      couple of days ago, I interviewed a \n      man and his daughter who had hidden in their basement during a tornado in \n      Kansas and the man told me how proud he was of his daughter \n      because\u00a0she was not worried about \u00a0her own well-being but for that of a neighbor and her \n      young baby.\u00a0After the storm destroyed their town, they managed to get \n      to their neighbor's house and \n      dig\u00a0the woman and her little baby out of the rubble.\u00a0And today, \n      the woman who was rescued was on our show\u00a0and the\u00a0thing that we \n      were all laughing at was\u00a0that the baby was so cute and he kept on \n      grabbing the microphone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlso \n      today, you'll definitely want to check \n      out\u00a0Sharyl Attkisson's exclusive \n      interview with\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham. Sen. Graham journeyed with \n      Sen. John McCain to Baghdad a couple of weeks ago and what\u00a0he kept \n      out of the public eye was that after Sen. McCain left, \u00a0he \n      stayed\u00a0on and served in uniform \n      as Colonel Graham for eight days. Prior to his political career, Sen. \n      Graham served in the Air Force, and in the \n      Guard and Reserves for 25 years. Aside from lending a helping hand to our \n      troops, Sen. Graham learned a much more personal lesson. After spending \n      the day with Navy Commander Philip Murphy-Sweet, who helped build the \n      brand new Green Zone courthouse, Murphy-Sweet was killed the following day by an \n      IED. Murphy-Sweet leaves behind a wife and three young children. Sen. \n      Graham said \u201c (this was) just a random chance in life that I spent the \n      last day with him. He was killed within 24 hours of when I met him. And I \n      guess the story goes for me that nothing good in Iraq happens without a \n      sacrifice.\u201d \u00a0This is an interview that you\u2019ll definitely want to see. \n      \n\u00a0\nOn a much lighter note, our \n      man about the house\u00a0Danny Lipford was in\u00a0Las Vegas checking \n      out some \n      really cool new products for your home and bath. The one I really \n      liked was the\u00a0Sweep-Away Cabinet Vacuum. \n      \u00a0You can store it under your sink and it acts as a central \n      vacuum. We would certainly get a lot of use out of it in my \n      house!\n\u00a0\nFinally, I hope you guys are \n      enjoying\u00a0\"CSI\" week on The Early \n      Show. \u00a0We\u2019ve been having a great time hanging with the \n      stars of the shows and their guest \n      stars like former tennis great John McEnroe, who plays himself on tonight's \"CSI: NY.\" And Joey \n      Lawrence, whom most remember from his days on \u201cBlossom\u201d \n      and \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d takes \n      on a different role as a serial killer and nemesis of Gary Sinise\u2019s character. Lawrence is also starring on Broadway as Billy Flynn \n      in Chicago. Joey told me today that he had \n      to learn\u00a0all his dialogue in \n      just 10 days! We\u2019ll have more behind the scenes of\u00a0\"CSI\" tomorrow on the show. \n      \n\u00a0\nAlso \n      tomorrow, Tori Ritchie\u00a0and I are back in the \n      kitchen at Williams-Sonoma where we\u2019ll show you how to make a \n      Mother's Day brunch; financial guru Ray Martin\u00a0tells us about how the \"working tax\"\u00a0affects dual-income families and writer \n      Mitch Albom will reveal the person whose memories of mom will win them a \n      Royal Caribbean cruise.\n\u00a0\nTake \n      Care,\n\u00a0\n      \nHannah\u00a0StormEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
