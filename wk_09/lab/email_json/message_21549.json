Would someone kindly point out where I\nam going wrong?\n\nThanks\n\nSimple Example:\n\n aa <- LETTERS[1:5]\n bb <- letters[1:5]\n  cat(aa[1], bb[1])    # works for individuals \n cat(aa,bb)            #(concatinates entire vectors)\n \n \n# Using sink I might get it to work if I could figure\nout how to escape a\n# new line command. encodeString does not seem\nappropriate here.\n harry <- c(rep(NA,5))\n for (i in 1:5 ) {\n cat (aa[i],bb[i])\n }\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
