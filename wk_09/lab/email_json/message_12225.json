Sugar: This week saw numerous small fixes in the UI to improve the\nzoom experience. Marco Gritti, Tomeu Vizoso, and Eben Eliason have\nreached a consensus about how to handle controls in the UI, which is an\nimportant part of our developer story. Some of the compromises we have\nmade won't give us the exact experience we are looking for, but they\nminimize risk to the project.There are more information? Thanks!!!!Gonzalo Odiard\n"}
