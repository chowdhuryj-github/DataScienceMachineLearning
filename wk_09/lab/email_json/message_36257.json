Is it my Cygwin home directory, where \"cd ~\" would take me \nwhile in Cygwin?  Is it my Windows CSIDL_PERSONAL folder, usually \n%HOMEDRIVE%/%HOMEPATH%/My Documents?  Is it the parent of that folder, \n%HOMEDRIVE%/%HOMEPATH%?\n\n\"~\" is a shell concept that makes sense in Unix-like shells, but not in \nWindows.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
