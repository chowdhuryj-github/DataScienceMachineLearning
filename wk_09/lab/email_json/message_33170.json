From earlier posts, I see that fptex was the\npreferred version, but it is no longer available. Now miktex is preferred.\nHowever, there are known issues with finding the style files in version 2.4.\nFortunately, www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/mikitex.html provides a\nseries of workarounds. My preference is #4, which appears to be the most\nstraightforward. However, version 2.4 is no longer available from\nwww.miktex.org. Moreover, the file structure changed significantly in\nversion 2.5. For instance, the /localtexmf directory does not exist after\ninstallation of miktex 2.6. I tried adding \"c:/Program\nFiles/R/R-2.5.0/share/texmf to miktex 2.6's root path, but it returns an\nerror that the path is \"not a TDS-compliant root directory\". I am not sure\nhow to fix this problem. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
