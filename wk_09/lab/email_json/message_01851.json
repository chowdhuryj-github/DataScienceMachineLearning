Both chambers are considering\nlegislation that would allow for the manufacture of lower-cost \"generic\"\ncopies of biopharmaceuticals. Proponents of the plan speak a language of\neasy certainties, but the issues -- and potential consequences -- are\nvastly more complex.\n\nBiopharmaceuticals, or biologics, are proteins made by splicing genetic\nmaterial into living cell cultures. Many biologics are breakthrough\ntherapies, from Avastin, which chokes off the blood supply to cancerous\ntumors, to Cerezyme, which treats the rare genetic disorder Gaucher's\ndisease. These drugs are expensive: Some can run to thousands of dollars\na year. According to IMS Health, the total cost reached $52.7 billion in\n2005, some 13% of U.S. drug spending. That figure is expected to rise to\n$90 billion by 2009.\n\nCalifornia Representative Henry Waxman has introduced the Access to\nLife-Saving Medicine Act because, he claims, all this is \"too\nexpensive.\" The reference point is the law Mr. Waxman co-authored in\n1984 allowing the Food and Drug Administration to approve cheaper,\ngeneric versions of conventional drugs once the patents on the originals\nexpire. When the Hatch-Waxman act went into effect, however, biologics\nwere barely on the medical horizon. The new bill -- also sponsored by\nSenators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer -- would establish a similar\nregulatory chute for approving \"biogenerics.\"\n\nBut this is an attempt to fit a new problem into a framework for which\nit wasn't designed. The pharmaceuticals currently covered under\nHatch-Waxman are \"small-molecule\" drugs made through distinct and\nreplicable chemical syntheses. Simple tests can show that a generic is\nchemically identical to the original. The same can't be said for\nbiologics: Because they are made from living cells, a generic will not\nbe biochemically identical to the original. For this reason,\n\"biogenerics\" are called \"follow-on biologics\" by the FDA. The FDA's\nEuropean counterpart calls them \"biosimilars.\"\n\nThe long protein chains in biologics are less well understood than\ntraditional drug molecules. Protein folding, glycosation or impurities\nintroduce variation, sometimes with adverse side-effects. In the late\n1990s, Johnson & Johnson sold a licensed version of Amgen's dialysis\ndrug Epogen, called Eprex in Europe. Several hundred patients developed\na serious immune reaction called pure red call aplasia due to a minor\nchange in the manufacturing process.\n\nFollow-on versions of some of the most basic biologics, like human\ninsulin and human growth hormone, are either on market or undergoing FDA\nreview. As the science becomes more sophisticated, the same will be\npossible for more complex biologics. Right now, it isn't.\n\nNevertheless, the Waxman legislation would establish\n\"interchangeability,\" or therapeutic equivalence, as the FDA standard: A\nprescription for expensive Avastin, say, could be filled by a cheaper\ngeneric product, even though the two might function differently in the\nbody. The legislation also enforces an abbreviated FDA review process,\ncircumventing the multiyear clinical trials and postmarket studies\nrequired of the original drugs. It even restricts the FDA's authority to\nrequire postmarket tests, in effect assuming into the process facts not\nin evidence.\n\nWhile some of the concerns about the potential side-effects of\nbiosimilars may be overstated, doctors and patients ought to have access\nto the clinical data that would allow them to evaluate for themselves\nthe risk-reward trade-offs. In that regard, it would be useful to ease\nthe FDA's onerous safety and efficacy regulations. But Mr. Waxman's\nproposal to do so selectively, only in the case of biosimilars, suggests\nother motives.\n\nThe animus at work here seems to be to tilt advantages away from Bio\nPharma toward the generics. Mr. Waxman's bill would weaken intellectual\nproperty protections such as clinical trial data exclusivity, and also\nestablish compulsory licensing. Further, it offers incentives for\ngenerics to work around the many patents that cover complex biologics\nbefore they expire. Even the EU provides more stringent patent\nguarantees for biosimilars.\n\nThe high prices of biologics reflect the difficulty and expertise\nrequired to develop these medicines. It should be possible to preserve\nincentives to innovate while advancing legitimate public health goals\nlike increased access. And generics can play a useful role in spurring\nthe reformulation of existing medicines in more efficacious ways. The\nchallenge is to strike a balance between access and innovation, which\nMr. Waxman and his allies fail to do. The real costs of this agenda\nmight well be fewer new biological therapies.\n\n--\nMike Palmedo\nResearch Coordinator\nProgram on Information Justice and Intellectual Property\nAmerican University, Washington College of Law\n4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016\nT - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659\nmpalmedo@wcl.american.edu\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
