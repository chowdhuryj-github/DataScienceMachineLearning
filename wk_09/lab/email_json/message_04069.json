I would like to intimate you with\ncertain facts that I believed would be of interest to you.I Would\nrespectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail\nconfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come\nby as a result of this mail.\u00a0\nI am contacting you in respect of $10.5 Million USD deposited with\nour private bank whose original depositor died in mid 2002,According to\npractice, The bank will by the end of its financial year broadcast a\nrequest for statements of claims,failing to receive viable claims they\nwill probably revert the deposit back to ADAM & COMPANY.This will\nresult in the money entering the ADAM & COMPANY accounting\nsystem,This will not happen if I have my way, the world of private\nbanking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy\ncertain offices and oversee certain portfolios.As a matter of\nfact,In line with our internal processes for account holders who\nhave passed away,we instituted our own investigations in good fate to\ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation\nhas for the past years been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent\nand used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the\nroot of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my\nbeing furnished with your details as a possible relative of the\ndeceased.\u00a0\nMy present official capacity as the Head of private banking sector\ndictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the\nonly party to receive the results of the investigation,leaves me as the\nonly person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in\nrelation to the deposit and the beneficiary of the deposit. \nMy proposal:I am prepared to place you in a position to initiate\nthe release of the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation,Upon\nsuccessful delivery of the deposit to you,I am prepared to share the\nmoney with you. That is: I will simply norminate you as the next of kin\nand have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50\n%.The alternative would be for us to have The bank ADAM & COMPANY\ndirect the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This\nway there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from\nThe bank. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of\nthe consequences of this proposal.
