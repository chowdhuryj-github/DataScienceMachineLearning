I also found that the speech went character by boring character as it read text that came onto the screen:  I had to use speakup's reading commands to get the reading right.\n\nCan you tell me where the info is on setting up another synth manually?  I'd like to try something other than flite.\n\nThanks!\n\nAl\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Hermann\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Sunday, May 27, 2007 1:04 PM\nSubject: Re: GRML swspeak?\n\n\n> Hi,\n> swspeak does work excellent under grml 1.0.\n> Did you type the word when the CD stops the first time?
