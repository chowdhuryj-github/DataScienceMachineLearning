The GCC maintainers put the manpage in non-free\nalong with the rest of the GCC docs. The manpage says at the bottom\nthat it's covered by the GFDL and mentions invariant sections that\naren't in the manpage. Huh? What does this mean as far as the location\nof the manpage and the GFDL/Debian fiasco?\n\nSlightly annoyed,\n- Jordi G.
