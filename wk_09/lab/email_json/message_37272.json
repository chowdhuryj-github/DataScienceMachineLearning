Are you interested in placing _any_ files on the clustered\nstorage?  And if so, should it be done via symlinks, or should we be\noverriding anything in config files (since at build time we won't know the\ndestination directories for anything on shared storage)?  For the current\nctdb, it seems nothing is stored in config files except a list of nodes, and\na list of public addresses, correct?\n\nI'll put a working samba_3_0_ctdb build setup on bzr tomorrow.\n\n\n-- \n-------------------\nJim McDonough\nSamba Team\njmcd at samba dot org\n\n"}
