You can probably work around it by changing\n'label.style' (see ?panel.contourplot). I can try to fix it if you\ngive me a reproducible example (e.g. save() your matrix and send it to\nme offline).\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
