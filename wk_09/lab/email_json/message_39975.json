Both\ndata frame got written into the database.  But when I tried to embed the\nscript to be called as system(\"R --save < whatever.R\") in my perl script, I\nsaw very strange things.\n\nOne of the data frame got written into the database without any problem.\nBut the other one refused to go to the database with the following error\nmessage:\n\n\"Error in mysqlExecStatement ... RS-DBI driver: (could not run statement:\nTable ... already exists)\n\nI have checked on line and find\nhttp://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/01c/0652.html talks about the same\nproblem I have en counted.  But the problem is that I have two data frame,\none works and the other does not. Also if I don't run under perl and run\ndirectly R under shell, both works.\n\nCan someone help?\n\nI am running R-2.5.0 with RMySQL-0.5-11 and DBI0.2.3.\n\nI am using linux redhat ES4.0 64 bit.\n\n-- \nWaverley @ Palo Alto\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
