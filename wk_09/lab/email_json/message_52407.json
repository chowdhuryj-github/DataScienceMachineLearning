It uses a form of math notation, and is thus not\nlanguage-specific, and resides in less than 32K. I control the\nlicensing on the software, and on a series of math textbooks written\nin the language, from arithmetic to calculus. I would be happy to GPL\nthe language and GDL the textbooks, if I can get some help with\nturning the software into a Sugar activity and a few other things.\n\nI also have a copy of an unpublished textbook for teachers on using\nthe software to teach programming, starting in third grade. I would be\nhappy to talk to the author about a GDL or Creative Commons license.\n\nWhat I would really like is the j engine (http://jsoftware.com/), but\nKen Iverson's son Eric won't so far discuss GPLing it. There are only\ncommercial and freeware versions. J already has the whole math and\ngraphics thing done up with a bow.\n\nOn 6/21/07, Rebecca Gettys  wrote:\n> Hey,\n> Me and Eben have been discussing HTML and CSS as an option for it, with\n> a mathmatics engine of course.
