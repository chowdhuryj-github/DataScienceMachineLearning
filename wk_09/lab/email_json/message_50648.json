The three-day, 400-point Dow sell-off from the week before underscores some serious problems that could easily split Wall Street into two separate halves: those who lose a bundle and those who make out like bandits. \n\n\n\n\nMeet Richard Band \n\n\n\n\n\nAs the newsletter world's #1 authority on investing for low growth, Richard Band is supremely qualified to help you find your way through these turbulent times. Since 1984, his recommendations have not only handed his readers 900% profits but also won him six \"Financial Advisory\" awards from the Newsletter and Electronic Publishers Foundation. As of this writing, his current portfolio includes 38 low-risk high-income stocks \u2013 36   have substantial gains; only two have losses. \nHis average gain per stock is a remarkable 40%. In addition, his Incredible Dividend Machine rising stocks are on track to hand investors 16% annual dividends.  As a result, Richard is a popular speaker at investment conferences. He is also the author of Contrary Investing, which was named \"Best Investment Book\" of 1985 and hailed by Barron's as one of the most moving and readable presentations on the subject.\"\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m Richard Band, and in all my years, I\u2019ve never seen more conflicting signals of both boom and bust.  On one hand earnings reports continue to look strong as U.S. corporations continue to increase sales and grow profits. \nOn the other hand, rising interest rates and gas prices could burst this bubble and send millions of unwitting investors directly to the poorhouse. \nWhat should you do? Buy? Sell? Play it safe on the sidelines? \nLog In to Tomorrow's FREE Online Conference and Avoid the Mistakes Others Will Make. HURRY\u2014Time is Running Out.  \nMake no mistake about it\u2014this market is changing fast.  Unless you have a plan to react to it, you could easily find yourself owning the wrong stocks in the wrong sectors and missing out on this market\u2019s biggest profit opportunities. \nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that you attend my special Online Conference tomorrow, Wednesday, June 20th at 4:00 p.m. ET, and email me your questions.

Of course, you did even better if you bought the specific stocks I recommended in that call. \nToday\u2019s situation is eerily similar to last June\u2019s\u2014the same forces are in play in the market, which means you could see the same profits (or more) in the next eight months if you know where to look. \n Here\u2019s What I\u2019ll Be Covering on Wednesday:\n The driving force behind June\u2019s big three-day sell-off and the surprising odds that you\u2019ll see other 400 point (or higher!) sell-offs later this year. \n How China\u2019s cooling stock market, rising labor rates and increased speculation will affect your portfolio\u2014even if you don\u2019t own one China stock.\n \n What\u2019s really driving the private equity boom.  How it\u2019s making shrewd investors rich.  How you can get into the game and bank big profits without sticking your neck out. \n PLUS...What you\u2019re not being told about the subprime lending crisis...how to play $65 oil...top takeover targets now...and much more. \nI can\u2019t stress this enough:  The biggest mistake you can make now is not understanding the forces at work in the marketplace.\n\nI don\u2019t want to see that happen to you.
