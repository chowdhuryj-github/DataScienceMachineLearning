That's what I would \nrecommend a sole user of R to do (and have long done myself).  However, \nif you are a sysadmin installing for many users of the machine, you will \nwant to install into a system area (or else a standard user is likely to \nbe able to uninstall R, for example).\n\nMy memory is that long ago the default for the R installer was c:\\R, and \nuser pressure made us change it.  BTW, the default is only c:\\Program \nFiles\\R for an administrator account: for unprivileged users it is under \nc:\\Documents and Settings\\ for XP and c:\\Users\\ for Vista.\nWe have some control in the installer script of these things, but have \nchosen to take the defaults which give the most familiar experience to end \nusers.\n\nThe file access reporting issues were occurring in ordinary user space.\n\nBrian\n\n\n> Thank you, by the way, for pursuing these issues.\n>\n> John\n>\n> --------------------------------\n> John Fox\n> Department of Sociology\n> McMaster University\n> Hamilton, Ontario\n> Canada L8S 4M4\n> 905-525-9140x23604\n> http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox\n> --------------------------------\n>\n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Prof\n>> Brian Ripley\n>> Sent: Saturday, April 14, 2007 1:57 AM\n>> To: R-help@R-project.org\n>> Subject: [R] Windows Vista issues\n>>\n>> It seemed FUD [*] has been prevailing here and elsewhere on\n>> Vista security features.\n>>\n>> I asked our sysadmins to set up a Vista box for me on which I\n>> have access to all levels of accounts.
