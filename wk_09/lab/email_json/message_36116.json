Checking the text in braille shows \nno typos. Especially it happens on webpages (read with w3m), but also in \ntext editors, but less often.\nI use Speakup with Espeak 1.25 via Speech-dispatcher and speechd-up.\nIs this known? \nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
