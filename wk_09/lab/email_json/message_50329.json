Here is the pending problem:\n\nI want to be able to insert delimiters, say commas, into a string of\ncharacters at uneven intervals such that:\n\nfoo<-c(\"haveaniceday\")#my string of character\nbar<-c(4,1,4,3) # my vector of uneven intervals\n\nmy.fun(foo,bar) # some function that places delimiters appropriately\n\nhave,a,nice,day # what the function would ideally return\n\nI've tried multiple for-loops using cut and paste but have not had success.\n\nThanks!\nChris Marcum\nUCI Sociology\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
