This\nrequires you have the linux kernel source installed\nfirst, of course. You then use a bash script to enable\nrecogniztion of the /dev/dtpc0 and to load the dectalk\nfirmware into the card.\nThis new kernel 2.6 version of the dectalk module has\nbeen working perfectly for me.\nSo for those of us still using Pentium 3's with ISA\nslots, you can use your dectalk cards if you wish.\nAccording to Maxi-Aids there are 7 of these ISA cards\nstill available for $24.95 each; with shipping it's\n$30.80.\n\nI hope someone finds this information useful.\n\n//Rich//\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
