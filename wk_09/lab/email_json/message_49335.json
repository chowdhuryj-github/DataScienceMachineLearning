If there is more than one drive in the system \nmake sure the one you are moving in is on the first IDE \nport so it's drive A, also make sure there are no conflicts\nif you have two drives in there ie make sure one is set as\nmaster by jumper and the other is set as slave. \n\nI think you can get disk boot error even if there is no disk\nat all, so start by checking the physical connections and \njumpering of drives.\n\nThe other thing that sometimes happens when moving \ndrives around is that what was drive a becomes drive \nc for example, in that case you will get a kernel panic \nwith message stating no root file system found. If this \nhappens, then the other procedure I mentioned will \nwork, booting from cdrom or floppy, loading the \nkernel from removable storage with the boot param\nroot= pointing to the proper location of root file system\n(follow that with noinitrd ro) and then once booted you\ncan rebuild the kernel and update the bootloader.\n\nWhat you are doing is definitely possible, I have done\nit many times, building an entire system on on PC then\nthen moving the drive to a mobile system.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
