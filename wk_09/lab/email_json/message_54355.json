This works well most of the \ntime except that yesterday I heard a message saying the system was trying \nto delete one of those directories and the system had failed since as \nhappens sometimes things that are supposed to store themselves in \ndirectories actually use the names chosen for those directories but end up \nbeing podcasts themselves.  Maybe external bittorrent couldn't figure out \nmy structure and messed up with its deletes.  Interestingly what it tried \nto delete had already been delivered that same day.  I don't know if this \nis normal podracer behavior or something beyond normal.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
