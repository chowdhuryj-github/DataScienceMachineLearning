But make sure you are choosing a\ndissimilarity coefficient that works well for species associations.\nThere is a whole section in Legendre and Legendre 1998 Numerical Ecology\n2nd English Edition Elsevier which may help here.\n\nHTH\n\nG\n\n> \n> Am I completely wrong with my thoughts?\n> \n> Birgit\n> \n> Am 20.06.2007 um 15:52 schrieb Stephen B.
