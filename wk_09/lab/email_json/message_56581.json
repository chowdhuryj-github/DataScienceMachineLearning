To the PoleThey move against, or through, or by, or toward.\nThe pain of being born into matter.Cascading snowflakes settle in the pines,\nRise, to the muffled chime of churchbell choir.Billows the fog, cloaks\nTo listen, by the sputtering, smoking fire,The purest form is always the one\nWind, sleet. The branches sway,Sculpting each tree to fit your ghostly form.\n\n"}
