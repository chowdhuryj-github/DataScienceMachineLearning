Is $parent{$pid} a reference to a hash? If so,\nyou can dereference it as a hash:\n\n    keys( %{ $parent{$pid} } )\n\nNow the argument to keys() is the hash whose reference was in $parent{$pid} .\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
