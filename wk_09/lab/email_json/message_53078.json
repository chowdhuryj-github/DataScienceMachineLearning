For example, if you were\ntrying to find the xy dimensions of an image file, that's easy with\nthe right module, with no need to muck about in the bytes from within\nyour own code.\n\n    http://search.cpan.org\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
