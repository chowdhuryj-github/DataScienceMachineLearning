Just look at how \nit states the model in terms of Prob(Y>=j) so that its coefficients are \nconsistent with the way people state binary models.\n\nI'm not clear on your generation of simulated data.  I specify the \npopulation logit, anti-logit that, and generate binary responses with \nthose probabilities.  I don't use rlogis.\n\nSee if using the PO model with lrm with penalization on the factor does \nwhat you need.\n\nlrm is not set up to omit an intercept with the -1 notation.\n\nMy book goes into details about the continuation ratio model.\n\nFrank Harrell\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
