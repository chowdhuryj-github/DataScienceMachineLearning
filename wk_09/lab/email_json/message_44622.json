I need some advise from those of you who are experts in installing \nany linux distro, especially ubuntu on a machine already having a msWindows \nxp box.  But before i ask the questions, I must clarify that I am intending \nto install Ubuntu via the VmWare Server.  I have already gotten the ubuntu \ndesktop distro, and I have already partially succeeded in accessing it via \nmy VMWare server.  I am now intent on installing it to my hard drive, so \nhere are the questions.\n1. My machine has three sata hard disks installed.  During the fourth step \nof the installation process, I came across the avibriation SDA describing my \nhard drive.  Is SDA a linux term for the Sata Hard disk?\n2.  During the installation process, I was ellocated 12264 mbs for my ubuntu \ninstallation.  Does this correspond with the amount of space that i gave to \nmy virtual disk during the configuration process of my virtual machine?\n3.  How do I allocate disk space for the various installed dirs, like slash \nand home.\n4. Where can i get comprehensive guidance and documentation on using and \nnavigating the gnome desktop.\n5.  How do i install and update software on ubuntu.\nand 6.  Where can I get comprehensive guidance and documentation on using \nubuntu for the various tasks like programming, listening to music, word \nprocessing, sending mail and so forth.\n\nSorry for the many questions, but as an inexperienced new bee in the linux \nworld, I thought it would be more prudent to ask these questions before I \nmake a start, or worse, mess up my pc.  Thanks for any help given.  Cheers! \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
