That is what matters,\nand that is what makes the software free.\n\nEven if my argument would be flawed (which I don't think it is, but just\nin case), that wouldn't even matter. What matters is that DFSG#1 talks\nabout \"a royalty or other fee\"--i.e. money--not \"giving up rights\"; and\nany interpretation of the text that says it does talk about giving up\nrights is incorrect to begin with.\n\n-- \nShaw's Principle:\n\tBuild a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will\n\twant to use it.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
