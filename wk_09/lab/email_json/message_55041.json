Bazaar and Mercurial\nare very different from Git in that they use strings (revision ids / file ids) \nto define the identity of revisions and files (and their history). Git defines \na tree or files' identity by just a hash of their contents (excluding their\nhistory). \n\nThis has the advantage for git that if you import the same tree by\ndifferent means (two people import a tarball independently), the tree\nwill have be considered the same by git and it won't worry about\nhistory. Bazaar or mercurial will consider the history of the trees as\nwell and this has the consequence that tools like bzr-svn have to work\non the full history (for now) and thus are much more complex than\ngit-svn.\n\nHowever, this model also has the disadvantage that git isn't able to store \nrename information. All it has is a best guess as to which file was renamed\nto which based on the contents of those files - and this can have\nconsequences for merges. Other disadvantages are\ndisambiguouty over the history of a tree and slow (and non-ambiguous?) \nperformance of annotation.\n\nI really think Bazaar has the best approach of the various DVCS systems.\nThey are also the (only?) one that focussed on correctness of model\nfirst rather than speed and that's really breaking them up at the\nmoment.\n\nFor the last half year I've used Bazaar for my Samba code, but while \nlocal performance has improved it's really, really slow to push across the\nfull history of Samba over the wire all the time. Until lazy \nrepositories/history horizons (being able to push/pull a tree without its \nhistory) land, I'll go back to Subversion for my Samba code.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n\nP.S. I'm a VCS n00b, please point out errors.\n\n-- \nJelmer Vernooij  - http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/\n\n"}
