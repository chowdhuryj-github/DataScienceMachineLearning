I just installed the proper\nversion of Hmisc, which works perfectly. Hmisc yields Harrell's C\n(rcorr.cens); all one need do is calculate the expected value for the\nrisk for each patient and make that the X variable.  You are a wonderful\ninfluence on all who perform statistics. \n\nWith kindest regards.\n\nMitchell S.

We have had no reports of Hmisc \nnot loading under Windows but Design is not currently available for \nWindows for R 2.5.
