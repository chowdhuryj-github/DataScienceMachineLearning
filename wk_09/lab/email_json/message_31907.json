Key senators from \n      both parties agreed with the White House on an immigration overhaul that \n      claims to fortify the U.S. border and quickly give legal status to the \n      millions of illegal immigrants who already live in the United States. \n      President Bush called the proposal \u201corderly and fair.\u201d Sharyl \n      Attkisson will explain the plan and Sandra Hughes will look at \n      the potential political and economic ramifications. In Iraq, the \n      massive search continues for the missing U.S. soldiers from the 10th \n      Mountain Division. More than 4,000 troops were on the hunt this week, and \n      our Mark Strassmann will have a firsthand report from the area \n      that\u2019s being searched. And to cap off our series Gotta Have It: \n      The Hard Sell to Kids, Nancy Cordes will report that Generation \n      Next is earning a new moniker: Generation Plastic. The average college \n      student graduates with more than $3,000 in credit card debt, and now \n      marketers are trying to hook kids as young as 3-years-old on spending \n      money they don\u2019t have. We\u2019ll wrap up tonight\u2019s broadcast by giving \n      you a peak inside the handwritten diaries Ronald Reagan kept during his \n      eight years in the White House. What was his revelation after being shot? \n      What ailment did he warn you can catch from your kids? Join us for the \n      answers tonight. Thanks!

That unique and \n      iconic voice was, of course, Walter Cronkite's. CBS News will celebrate \n      the legendary newsman's singular life and career in a CBS News primetime \n      special, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS - CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90,\" to be \n      broadcast Friday, May 18th (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television \n      Network. \n\n\n\nSATURDAY ON 48 \n      HOURSHere's a note from Producer Miguel \n      Sancho on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, Beyond the \n      Boardwalk: \"This report is a heartbreaker. It chronicles the \n      tragic descent of four beloved but troubled women onto the harsh streets \n      of Atlantic City, and their ultimate demise at the hands of a suspected \n      serial killer. Like any good 48 Hours Mystery episode, this \n      program provides in-depth coverage of the crime and the investigation: the \n      case is a true whodunit, replete with intriguing clues and some very \n      unusual suspects. But just as importantly, the report explores the \n      dynamics of the criminal underworld where the victims, and many young \n      women like them, found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of \n      drug-abuse, prostitution, and violence. From a producer's \n      perspective, covering this story was an intense and harrowing experience. \n      Atlantic City is an awesome place -- in the very literal sense of \n      inspiring awe. To its great credit, Atlantic City does not pretend to be \n      Disneyland - it is an unabashed adult entertainment environment. And it \n      cannot be denied that the gaming industry has created tens of thousands of \n      jobs, and streamed countless millions of tax revenues into the state. \n      Still, when you first arrive in town, the contrast between the hulking \n      casinos and the squalor that surrounds them is a shock. Frankly the place \n      can look like a collaboration of Bukowski and Bosch. Then, as you start to \n      get a sense of how the streets operate and who the players are - the \n      not-so-hidden economy of sin-seeking tourists, drug dealers, hustlers, and \n      street-walkers - there's the thrill of gaining secret, specialized \n      knowledge. Atlantic City is, truly, one of most fascinating places I have \n      ever been, and for the journalist and the junkie alike, the action of \n      street life is an addiction all its own. But after a while, as you become \n      attached to people whose lives are so sad and hopeless, reporting becomes \n      an emotional ordeal. It is hard to wade through all the human wreckage of \n      the city's dark side without absorbing some of the suffering one \n      witnesses. After three days there, you want desperately to leave. Of \n      course once you've left you can think only about going back. It \n      may be easy for people to dismiss the murders as a story of four women who \n      succumbed to their own bad judgment and worse luck. Others may see the \n      killer as a something of an allegorical figure, a human embodiment of the \n      danger and damage of drug addiction. But if there's one thing I hope the \n      viewers remember, it is that these women, for all their problems, were \n      very real human beings. They all had families and friends who loved them. \n      They all had young children. And whatever bad choices they'd made, none of \n      them deserved this.\" - Miguel Sancho (48 \n      Hours Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT) If you would \n      like more information on any of these stories or the broadcast, please \n      click on the following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n\n\n\u00a0\nSUNDAY \n      ON\u00a060 \n      MINUTES\nDEEPWATER: The country is less secure and the U.S. \n      Coast Guard is in worse shape now than when it began its $24 billion \n      \"Deepwater\" refurbishment plan years ago, says a congressman overseeing \n      the maritime force.
