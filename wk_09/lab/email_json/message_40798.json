I'm trying to install Linux via  a virtual machine.\nAlso, does anyone else know how I'd be able to mount my card reader (wich is \nused by Windows) so that the VMWare box could use it?\nRegards,\n--Keith. \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
