Secondly the in the solution by Horace if corr(x, y) is beta \nthen \nit implies that var(x) = var(y). Is that you want Mark. Well what i did i \nam writing it down hereas under, may be its wrong.Please comment\n\nvar(y_t) = var(beta * x_t) + e_t)\n=> var(y_t) = beta * var(x_t) + var(e_t) + cov(beta * x_t , e_t)\nas cov(beta * x_t , e_t) = 0 hence\nvar(y_t) = beta * var(x_t) + var(e_t)............(i)\n\nthen \n\ncorr(x_t, y_t) = beta = cov(x_t, y_t)/ (sigma_x * sigma_y) \n................ (ii)\n\nfurther E[y_t] = beta * E[x_t] + E[e_t].........as E[e_t] = 0 hence\n\nbeta = E[y_t] / E[x_t]............(iii)\n\nNow what to do ???\n\n\n\n\n\nMark, I suppose you make the usual assumptions, ie. E[x]=0, \nE[x*epsilon]=0, the correlation is just simply,\n\ncorr(x,y) = beta * ( var(x) / var(y) )\n\nAnd you could get var(y) from var(x) and var(epsilon).\n\nHTH.\n\nHorace\n\n\n\n\nThis is not an R question but if anyone can help me, it's much\nappreciated.\n\nSuppose I have a series ( stationary ) y_t and a series x_t ( stationary\n)and x_t has variance sigma^2_x and epsilon is normal \n(0, sigma^2_epsilon )\n\nand the two series have the relation\n\n  y_t = Beta*x_t + epsilon\n\nMy question is if there are particular values that sigma^2_x and\nsigma^2_epsilon have to take in order for corr(x_t,y_t) to equal Beta ?\n\nI attempted to figure this out using two different methods and in one\ncase I end up involving sigma^2_epsilon and in the other I don't\nand I'm not sure if either method is correct. I think I need to use\nresults form the conditional bivariate normal but i'm really not sure.\nAlso, it's not a homework problem because I am too old to have homework.\nThanks for any insights/solutions.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide \nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n\n\n============================================================================================\nDISCLAIMER AND CONFIDENTIALITY CAUTION:\\ \\ This message and ...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
