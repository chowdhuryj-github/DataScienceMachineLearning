Its objective is to drive the cost^ of drugs down to levels\nthat patients can afford.^\n\nThe UK led initiative, called the Medicines Transparency Alliance,^ has\njust had its first stakeholder meeting and will be launched^ in the\ncoming months. It will run pilot projects in up to nine^ countries. Its\naim is to publish information on the amount,^ quality, and price of\ndrugs in poor countries; to allow patients^ to see what they should pay\nand give them confidence in the^ quality and safety of the drugs; and to\ncreate a forum in each^ pilot country that will bring together patients,\ndoctors, non-governmental^ organisations, and those involved in\nsupplying drugs.^\n\nHilary Benn, secretary of state for international development,^ said at\nthe stakeholder meeting: \"One third of the world's population^ has no\naccess to the drugs they need to help them fight disease,^ and up to 30%\nof drugs available in the poorest countries are^ fake or substandard.\nEven when the right medicines are available^ they are unaffordable for\nthe majority of people in developing^ countries, with mark-ups of up to\n500% by some pharmacists.\"^\n\nThe UK Department for International Development is also creating^ an\ninternational advisory body to inform it of new developments^ and to\nidentify ways to obtain and deliver drugs at sensible^ prices to the\ndeveloping world. At an international conference^ on access to drugs,\nhosted jointly by the department and the/^ Lancet/, the department's\nundersecretary of state, Gareth Thomas,^ challenged the drug industry,\nnon-governmental organisations,^ and governments to find new ways to\nensure that drugs reached^ people in developing countries at affordable\nprices. He invited^ participants at the conference to contribute to\nfurther debate^ at the department and to put themselves forward to join\nthe^ advisory body.^\n\n\"Finding new, innovative solutions-through new partnerships^ and\nnetworks, bringing down costs, accelerating research, [and]^ jumping\nover legal hurdles-is vital if we are to get serious^ about improving\naccess to medicines for the poorest people of^ the world,\" said Mr Thomas.^\n\nPresentations at the conference showed that success in reducing^ the\ncost of drugs in developing countries is not just about^ obtaining\ndiscounts from the industry and engineering flexibility^ in patent\nrights-the subjects of media attention. Access^ to drugs is affected by\nevery aspect of the supply process,^ delegates heard. Relevant factors\nincluded research into and^ development of treatments for neglected\ndiseases; patent control^ over the manufacture and sale of drugs;\ncompetition with generic^ drugs; the supply chain by which the drugs are\ndelivered; unethical^ local incentives to supply specific drugs;\ngovernment support^ of health priorities; and the means by which\nhospitals and clinics^ are able to get payment for services to patients.^\n\nJonathan T Mwiindi, from the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network,^ Kenya,\ncommented on the difficulty of dealing with the unethical^ and often\ninvisible practices of intermediaries in the supply^ chain. For\ninstance, retailers may receive incentives (such^ as a television) for\nstocking certain products; and prescribing^ patterns may be sold to\nagents, who then put pressure on individual^ doctors. He believes that\nthere has been a shift from a culture^ of medical representatives\noffering information on the best^ use of drugs to one of sales\nrepresentatives who are paid incentives^ to maximise volume generated\nfrom prescribers.^\n\nTrevor Jones, former head of the Association of the British^\nPharmaceutical Industry, suggested a naming and shaming mechanism^ to\ncounter bad practices. However, one of the conference participants^\npointed out that such a procedure might endanger the lives of^ the\nwhistleblowers and the perpetrators in some countries.^\n\nIt was also pointed out that the local mark-up of drug prices^ is not\nalways caused by corruption. In many hospitals most patients^ are\nunwilling to pay for \"non-tangibles,\" such as a consultation^ that\nresults in no drug being prescribed. So the mark-up is^ sometimes the\nmain way by which hospitals can cover their consultation^ and other\ncosts, and it is the cheapest drugs that are most^ often heavily marked\nup.^\n\n\n    Rapid Responses:\n\nRead all _Rapid Responses_ \n\n*Economic value relative to clinical outcome should be the U.K.'s\nobjective.*\n    Jeremiah Norris\n    bmj.com, 28 Apr 2007 _[Full text]:\n    http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/334/7599/870-a#164510_\n    \n\n\n\n--\nJoana Ramos, MSW\nCancer Resources & Advocacy\nSeattle WA USA\nTel. +1-206-229-2420\nhttp://ramoslink.info/\nwww.cancersurvivorsproject.org\nwww.healthyskepticism.org\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
