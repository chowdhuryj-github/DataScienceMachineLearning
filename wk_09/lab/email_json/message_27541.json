More than two dozen US States and several Canadian Provinces have adopted some type of AltReg plan for electric or gas utilities. AltReg is also the norm overseas and has been implemented in most countries in Europe, Latin America, and Australia/New Zealand. AltReg can be designed to achieve a number of important regulatory objectives. For example, AltReg plans can reward utilities for good cost and quality performance and discourage bad performance. By linking financial outcomes to company performance, AltReg creates stronger incentives for utilities to manage costs, be innovative, and improve reliability and service quality compared with traditional cost-of-service regulation. A number of recent AltReg plans also establish innovative regulatory approaches for funding and recovering infrastructure investments.\n\u00a0\nThis seminar is designed to give its participants a good understanding of the basics of AltReg. There will be a comprehensive review of the range of AltReg options and the types of plans that have been approved throughout North America. There will be an extensive analysis of the main issues companies need to address when designing AltReg plans for both rates and service quality applications. There will also be a discussion of an innovative \u201cincentive power\u201d model that companies and regulators can use to evaluate and compare regulatory alternatives. In addition, the seminar will consider recent experiences with AltReg in the US and Canada, including revenue decoupling for gas utilities and several plans for bundled power services, as well as \u201cstate of the art\u201d developments in leading jurisdictions in North America and throughout the world.\n\u00a0\nWhat Attendees Will Learn\n\n\nThe basics of AltReg plans\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of AltReg compared to cost of service regulation\n\nThe range of available AltReg options\n\nThe main issues involved in designing AltReg plans that apply to rates and service quality\n\nAltReg approaches that encourage infrastructure investment\n\nImportant new developments in revenue decoupling AltReg and AltReg for bundled power services\n\nRecent and \u201cstate of the art\u201d AltReg developments in the US, Canada and throughout the world\n\n\n\nWho Should Attend\n\u00a0\nThe seminar is designed for management and senior level utility personnel, particularly those responsible for ratemaking, regulation and corporate strategy, as well as members of State, Provincial and Federal regulatory agencies.
