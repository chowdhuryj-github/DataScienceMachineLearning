I will have to do this to multiple data sets which\nmay contain different plots, and may contain up to 1200 plots, so I can't\nchoose the plots by hand.\n\nPlease help me with this.  I'm an ecologist and I'm in Panama, with no one\naround who is educated in R.  Whoever solves this problem for me will be\nacknowledged in any resulting publications.\n\nThanks!\n-Claire\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/sampling-problem---new-to-R-tf3872130.html#a10970708\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
