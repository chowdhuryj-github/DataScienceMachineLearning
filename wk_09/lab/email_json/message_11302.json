I know that\nI can do that with bty='l' but I don't want to, I find that the plots\nlook less cluttered with disjoint axes.\n\nHowever, I was intrigued enough by her comments that I decided to\nsolicit the opinions of others on this issue.  Are there principled\nreasons why one should prefer joined axes or disjoint axes?\n\nBrant Inman\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
