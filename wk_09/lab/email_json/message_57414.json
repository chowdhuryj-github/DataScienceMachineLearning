Switch to e.g. contr.helmert and the results becomesimilar. Marginal tests of main effects in the presence of interactionis not necessarily a good idea and they have been debated here andelsewhere a number of times before. People don't agree entirely, but thedividing line is essentially whether it is uniformly or just mostly abad idea. It is essentially the discussion of type III SS.\n> fortune(\"type III\")\nSome of us feel that type III sum of squares and so-called ls-means arestatistical nonsense which should have been left in SAS.   -- Brian D.
