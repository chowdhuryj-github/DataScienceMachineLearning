Just google for them.\n\nhttp://groups.google.com is a great place to get sample Perl/Tk\nscripts. Almost every type of script has been posted online, and all\nyou need to do is search for it.... like \"perl tk button\" etc.\n\nBut if you would tell us a bit about your script, we could give you a\nhead start by telling what widgets or modules you might need to use.\n\nzentara\n\n-- \nI'm not really a human, but I play one on earth.\nhttp://zentara.net/japh.html\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
