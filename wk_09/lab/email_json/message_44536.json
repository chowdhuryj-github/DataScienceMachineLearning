I added the CRAN repository to apt and installed 2.5.0\nwith apt-get. I then did an install.packages(\"Rmpi\") on cluster nodes.\nRmpi loads and lamhosts() shows the nodes, but mpi.spawn.Rslaves()\nfails (something to do with temp files?). Rmpi works fine with the\nEdgy-native version of R (2.3.x) and installing Edgy's r-cran-rmpi\nwith apt. (But I need some other packages that only work in 2.4+!)\nCould this be a problem with the latest Ubu debs on CRAN? The Rmpi\nauthor says his R 2.5 setup works fine. CC me please as I'm not\nsubscribed.\n\nTHK\n\n-- \nTimothy H.
