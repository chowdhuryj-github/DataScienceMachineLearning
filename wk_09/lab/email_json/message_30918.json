Is there a\nstraight forward way to convert this directly into a numeric matrix rather\nthan a vector?\n\nAdditionally, I've also considered:\n\ndata.matrix(sample.data[-1,-1]\n\nbut bizarrely, it returns:\n\n  x y z\n2 1 1 1\n3 2 2 2\n4 3 3 3\n\nThanks,\nAndrew\n\n\nOn 5/16/07, Marc Schwartz  wrote:\n>\n> On Wed, 2007-05-16 at 08:10 -0400, Andrew Yee wrote:\n> > I have the following csv file:\n> >\n> > name,x,y,z\n> > category,delta,gamma,epsilon\n> > a,1,2,3\n> > b,4,5,6\n> > c,7,8,9\n> >\n> > I'd like to create a numeric matrix of just the numbers in this csv\n> dataset.\n> >\n> > I've tried the following program:\n> >\n> > sample.data <- read.csv(\"sample.csv\")\n> > numerical.data <- as.matrix(sample.data[-1,-1])\n> >\n> > However, print(numerical.data) returns what appears to be a matrix of\n> > characters:\n> >\n> >   x   y   z\n> > 2 \"1\" \"2\" \"3\"\n> > 3 \"4\" \"5\" \"6\"\n> > 4 \"7\" \"8\" \"9\"\n> >\n> > How do I force it to be numbers rather than characters?\n> >\n> > Thanks,\n> > Andrew\n>\n> The problem is that you have two rows which contain alpha entries.\n>\n> The first row is treated as the header, but the second row is treated as\n> actual data, thus overriding the numeric values in the subsequent rows.\n>\n> You could use:\n>\n>   as.numeric(as.matrix(sample.data[-1, -1]))\n>\n> to coerce the matrix to numeric, or if you don't need the alpha entries,\n> you could modify the read.csv() call to something like:\n>\n>   read.csv(\"sample.csv\", header = FALSE, skip = 2, row.names = 1,\n>            col.names = c(\"name\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\")\n>\n> This will skip the first two rows, set the first column to the row names\n> and give you a data frame with numeric columns, which in most cases can\n> be treated as a numeric matrix and/or you could explicitly coerce it to\n> one.\n>\n> HTH,\n>\n> Marc Schwartz\n>\n>\n>\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
