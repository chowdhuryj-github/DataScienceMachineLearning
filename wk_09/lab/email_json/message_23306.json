Like I said, assuming his ethernet card gets an IP\nassigned to it, (I.E. he configures a static one manually), he can\nthen ping that ip to see if the card itself works. I was also pointing\nout however that pinging his loopback interface as you describe\nwouldn't help him in solving his ethernet card problems. One could\nping the loopback interface even without a ethernet card or modem\ninstalled in the system, and one would still get responses to the ping\nfrom the loopback interface.\n\nGreg\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 04, 2007 at 03:54:24PM -0500, Richard Villa wrote:\n> I was just assuming that he was saying that he couldn't connect, and \n> therefore didn't have an IP address assigned.\n\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGO7Xh7s9z/XlyUyARAs2lAJ47/gt1OeI8KBaSaXxVgNUBeNNulACgrUh5\nCYLo0fNVLilF/mMc1Ps/ipc=\n=Pd5f\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
