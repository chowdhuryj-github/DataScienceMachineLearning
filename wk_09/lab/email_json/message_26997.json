No detail was missed by her. She planned for food, clothing, train tickets and forged passes. She even included sedatives for crying babies. She never lost a passenger. On at least one occasion, she threatened to shoot a passenger who had second thoughts about escaping. The overnight stops on what came to be know as the Underground Railroad were a network of homes and churches. The churches raised money to assist Tubman's efforts. \n\nOur intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.\n\nhttp://jgrkaj.cecefill.com/change/\n\n"}
