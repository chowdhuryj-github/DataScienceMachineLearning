It may be worth filing a bug report over this; even if\nFile::Copy isn't fixed, its documentation should mention this.\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
