The command line interpreter you're\nrunning doesn't expand wildcards.  That's why Perl wasn't giving you\nany errors - it had nothing to do because there was no file named \"*\"\nthat it could find...   You'll have to expand the wildcard from within\nPerl.\n\nperl -pi.bkp -e\"BEGIN { @ARGV = glob($ARGV[0]); }  s/old/new/;\" *\n\nHope this helps,\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
