For years, pundits outside the music\nindustry have accused labels of pandering to teens through boy bands and\n\"manufactured\" celebrities instead of being concerned with finding,\nproducing, and releasing art. The IFPI suggests that the labels could\n(and would) be doing exactly that if file-swapping went away.

The new compilers are Intel's first\nthat are capable of doing thread-level optimization and\nauto-vectorization simultaneously in a single pass. \"On the data\nparallelism side, the Intel C++ Compiler and Fortran Professional\nEditions both sport improved auto-vectorization features that can target\nIntel's new SSE4 extensions. For thread-level parallelism, the compilers\nsupport the use of Intel's Thread Building Blocks for automatic\nthread-level optimization that takes place simultaneously with\nauto-vectorization... Intel is encouraging the widespread use of its\nIntel Threading Tools as an interface to its multicore processors. As the\ncompany raises the core count with each generation of new products, it\nwill get harder and harder for programmers to manage the complexity\nassociated with all of that available parallelism. So the Thread Building\nBlocks are Intel's attempt to insert a stable layer of abstraction\nbetween the programmer and the processor so that code scales less\npainfully with the number of cores.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/05/1922250\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070605-intel-updates-compilers-for-multicore-era.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Controlling Computers With the Brain                               |\n|   from the telepathic-smileys dept.                                |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday June 05, @16:34 (Biotech)           |\n|   http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/05/182237       |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]Killam0n takes note of a story in CNN Money on [1]progress in\ncontrolling computers via brainwaves.
