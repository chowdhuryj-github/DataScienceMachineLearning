For example,\nif I look at\n\nspectrum(fdeaths, spans = c(3,3))\n\nI'd say the fundamental harmonics are about 1, 2, 3.5 and 4.5 - but\nhow can I extract these automatically?  (preferably with some\nheuristic for choosing the smoothing spans too)\n\nI'm aware of heuristic methods for finding peaks for general sequences\n(as found by searching for peaks on R-help) but I have a feeling\nthere's something with some theoretical justification for the case of\nperiodograms.  Could anyone point me in the right direction in terms\nof theory or an R package that implements an approach?\n\nThanks,\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
