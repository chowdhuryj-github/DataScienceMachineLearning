Re:  Rebe", "body": "\n\nHi Eben --\nYes.\nEtoys has external formats for its \"documents\", so they can be\nstored on servers, fetched, passed around, etc. We have tried 3 different\napproaches over the years (and all work currently). One of the approaches\nuses the Open Doc standard (where the scripts are in there as\nnon-standard data). The format we are using now is a form of\ns-expressions (could be XML, but XML is really too verbose for the XO and\nfor slow networks).\nAnd, as I mentioned in the previous email, when on an XO itself, all the\nmedia objects could be integrated as collections of frame-less X-windows\n(or some similar but simpler mechanism).\nEtoys (and, better, an improvement in Etoys that has more age range)\ncould be done in Python by writing a parser for one of the file formats\nand making the Etoys graphical environment and control in Python. This\nwould completely unify these ideas on the XO -- but something more like\nthe integrated architecture for many kinds of media objects would still\nhave to be created. \nIn other words, Etoys per se are not nearly as important as the ideas and\naccess to authoring power for children that they implement.\nIn any case, we are gradually working on the next version of an Etoys\nlike environment that deals much more richly with more of the important\nissues for\u00a0 children's authoring than we do now.\nCheers,\nAlan\n\nAt 01:34 PM 6/21/2007, Eben Eliason wrote:\nI think the biggest point to be\nmade here is an argument for a \"document\" or \"object\"\nof sorts.\u00a0 Etoys definitely seems to have most of the types of\ninteraction and media embedding solutions I believe Rebecca and I both\nwant, but (as far as I know, though I admittedly don't know that much) it\ndoes so in an all encompassing environment.\u00a0 What we really need is\na lightweight format that lets one pass around these\n\"scratchpads\" or \"collages\" as objects, so the\nteacher can create a file, pass it out as homework, etc.\u00a0 I could be\nvery wrong in my assumptions, though, so please correct me where I\nam.\u00a0 I see lots of potential for Etoys, and I'd like to better\nunderstand how it integrates with Sugar now, and how we can push it in\nthe most effective direction. \n\n- Eben\nOn 6/21/07, Bert Freudenberg\n<bert@freudenbergs.de>\nwrote:\n\nIndeed, \"scratchpad\" describes Etoys pretty precisely\n;)\nYou can draw, write (even with multi-column text layout flowing\naround abjects), and of course calculate.\nIt's not just \"type anywhere and a curve pops up\", although\nin fact \nsuch an extension exists (but not included in the OLPC Etoys\nversion): called MathMorphs and MorphicWrappers done by the\nArgentinian Squeak community a couple years ago:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.dm.uba.ar/MathMorphs/\nand updated to work in recent Squeak releases\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nhttp://wiki.squeak.org/squeak\n/5855\nIf there is enough interest in this (and I agree it's a great \nenvironment for exploring Math) we might try to find someone\nporting\nit to the OLPC version. Or maybe it just works if installed, I\nhaven't tried (unfortunately our plates are still full with\nlower-\nlevel stuff). \n\n- Bert -\nOn Jun 21, 2007, at 22:01 , Eben Eliason wrote:\n> Rebecca -\n>\n> This sounds similar to some of my ideas for\n\"Collage\"...allowing\n> combinations of text, drawing, image, and other media formats in\na \n> freeform canvas.\u00a0 The response there seemed that Etoys was,\nin many\n> ways, already providing such a thing.\u00a0 I think this is a\nreally\n> interesting area though, and the potential to be able to\nsend\n> multimedia documents around, specifically in an educational\n> environment, is huge.
