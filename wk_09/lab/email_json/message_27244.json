The potential is big (being able to\naccess the whole mozilla API directly from python open a tons of\npossibilities).\n\nWithout having played with it a lot, my feeling is that the technology\nis mostly there. It just needs to be used and documented to get more\nmature and accessible.\n\nThe first step is to get it building on the trunk. Bridging it to\ngtkmozembed looks trivial then.\n\nAnyone feels like giving this a try? I don't have a lot of time these\ndays but I'd be glad to give some guidance. Getting this to work might\nprovide an awesome piece of infrastructure to the project, without a lot\neffort!\n\nMarco\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
