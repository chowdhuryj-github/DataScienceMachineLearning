I can\naccess individual elements of this by e.g. c[[1]] or c[[1]]$estimate or\nc[[n]] or whatever, but is there a way to get out the vector of all\nestimates, or all p-values?\n\ni.e. if I want to get out a vector p which is in effect,\n\np <- c(c[[1]]$p.value, c[[2]]$p.value, ..... )\n\ncan I do this without doing a for loop?\n\nI note that I can't do something like c[[1:n]]$p.value, for example.\n\nI have to say I don't understand the notation c[[n]] to get the n'th\nestimate so if anyone could explain it I would be very happy.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n    -- Joe\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
