Did 2.6.18 work?\n\nI have seen many (ubuntu/debian) people complain that their computer\ngot very slow after moving to dapper/etch.\n\nThe solution somebody offered was to use the 486 and this seems to work\nfor 2.6.18 at least.\n\n\nHopefully 2.6.20-686 works though\n\nPreben\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
