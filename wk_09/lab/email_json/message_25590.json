I think I need to use\nresults form the conditional bivariate normal but i'm really not sure.\nAlso, it's not a homework problem because I am too old to have homework.\nThanks for any insights/solutions.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
