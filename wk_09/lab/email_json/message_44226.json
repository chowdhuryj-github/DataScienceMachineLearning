She always sounds like she's\ntrying to seduce you with the way she talks.\nDrives me nuts.\nThere's some rather unique voices too. (ones I'd use for games, but\nnot for normal usage) like bad news, bubles and the one that sounds\nderanged.\n\n\nOn Jun 6, 2007, at 7:51 PM, Spie Smith wrote:\n\n> That's a great idea.
