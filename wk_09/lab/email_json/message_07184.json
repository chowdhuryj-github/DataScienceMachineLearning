That looks like it might work, but a couple of\nthings...\n\n1) The resulting 73 (in my case) histograms will be named by their variable\nnumber, not by the variable name contained in the first row. Any way to\ninclude the variable name in the resulting histogram?\n\n2) How can I avoid having the resulting \"output.wmf\" files overwrite each\nother? I'd like to keep all of them, not just the last one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks, Mark\n\n\n\nOn 4/16/07, jim holtman  wrote:\n>\n> try:\n>\n> win.metafile(file=\"output.wmf\")\n> lapply(dataframe[3:20], hist)\n> dev.off()\n>\n> On 4/16/07, mtb954@gmail.com  wrote:\n> > Hi R-helpers,\n> >\n> > I wish to produce frequency histograms of all of the variables in my\n> > dataframe (except some identifying variables).\n> >\n> > I have tried\n> >\n> > >hist(dataframe[,3:20])\n> >\n> > to produce histograms of the 3rd through 20th variables in my dataframe,\n> but\n> > R doesn't like that.\n> >\n> > Could anyone provide a suggestion?\n> >\n> > Also, once I produce the histograms, I'd like to save them as graphic\n> files\n> > on my computer.
