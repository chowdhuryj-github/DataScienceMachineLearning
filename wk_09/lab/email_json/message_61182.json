The license text doesn't apply as the terms for the software on\nthe CD unless and until the copyright holder explicitly declares so in\na grant of license unabiguously on that particular software.\n\n> > At the end of the day, the intentions of the licensor are\n> > important, and if those intentions are made explicitly clear, it's\n> > a bit difficult for the GPL to contradict them.\n>\n> But the GPL _is_ the intent of the licensor.
