I even have the floppy images from debian.org.  I'm trying to \nget away from package managers, and doing things like gentoo (sp?). \nScratch installations from post-compiled source.  I'm just not ready to \ngive up on some package management support yet.  I've always planned on \nporting to Slackware.  Going blind sorta pushed me into the comversion \nbefore I anticipated it, since Slack has some pretty good SpeakUp support.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
