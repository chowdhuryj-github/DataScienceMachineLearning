If your BIOS allows for an AUTO \nsetting try that and it should auto-detect the drives. On most of the\nolder BIOS there was an auto detect function you could invoke \nby pressing a key like F8 or similar and it would detect the drives\nand set the BIOS properly, newer BIOS can auto-detect at boot\ntime. If you know which slave slot is for CD and if there is a CD \nsetting in the BIOS, use that setting, and check to make sure the\nCD drive is jumpered as slave.\n\nIf drives are not showing up then usually they are either not \njumpered correctly or the BIOS setting is not correct. There are\ntwo other possible pains with old BIOS, one is limitation of \ndrive size, some older BIOS may not support the full capacity.\nSome drives have a special jumper setting for this which will \nlimit the drive size for older BIOS. And in some rare cases \nyou need to manually set the capacity, number of cylinders \nand tracks, although its becoming rare that you'd have to do\nthat anymore.\n\nThe most important thing is making sure the drives are \njumpered correctly as one master and one slave on each \ncable and making sure the drive is enabled in BIOS, if\nthere is an auto setting in BIOS try that, if the drive is \nstill not working, the drive will be labeled with info for \ncylinder/track/capacity and you can set them manually.\nHopefully you will not need to do this.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
