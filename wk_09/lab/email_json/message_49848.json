If SpeakUp were implemented more as a module...can't modules be\nloaded from the lilo/grub boot prompt?  If so, then it could be included\nas a kernel module, loaded at startup by those who need it...I really\nneed to see the code.   I'm thinking if it were a module that \nsimply works with the kernal, there'd be less resistance to adding it to \nthe source.  Does the kernal support dual monitors?  It could possibly \nbe implemented in a similar manner...if Linus already has implemented \nsomething similar.  Just follow his example...use his own code against \nhim, in a manner of speaking.   We could also get him really, \nreally drunk and tell him that he was the one who wrote it.  I could \nalso threaten to marry his sister?  It would be worth it.\n\n         Michael\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
