But did you know that you can take a natural alternative with no side effects?\n\n\nIt safely reduces cholesterol absorption by 40% or more, \n\nclinical tests show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrugs like Lipitor(r), Zocor(r), Crestor(r) and \n\nthe other statins can cause a whole new set of problems.\n\n\nThat's why the most common question on our Customer Care Hotline is, \"Will I be able to discontinue taking statins?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, many people have their prescriptions cut back or \n\neven discontinued after just a few months. So, ask your doctor if you can try the safe, natural alternative. It really works. But follow your \n\ndoctor's advice, and don't stop taking any prescription until you get your physician's okay.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are subscribed to juuldomingoserver.net with the email address kahlia@speedy.uwaterloo.ca.\nIf you wish to be excluded from future juuldomingoserver.net mailings,\nplease click here\nor write us at:\n287 S.
