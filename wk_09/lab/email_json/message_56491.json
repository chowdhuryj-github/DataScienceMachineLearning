This course includes material about recognizing project needs for complex transactions involving multiple\n                          discrete risks. Specifi c examples and actual market data are used to illustrate basic principals and ideas. This seminar uses several\n                          approaches to elicit participation from attendees including group exercises. Participants will have plenty of opportunities to ask questions\n                        and discuss issues of special interest.
