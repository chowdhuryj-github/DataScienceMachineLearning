I don't think that Mark's query makes much\nsense, unless he meant to ask: which individuals have high/low scores on\nPC1/PC2.  Here are some comments that may be tangentially related to Mark's\nquestion:\n\n1.  If one is worried about a few data points contributing heavily to the\nestimation of PCs, then one can use robust PCA, for example, using robust\ncovariance matrices.  MASS has some tools for this.\n2.  The \"biplot\" for the first 2 PCs can give some insights\n3. PCs, especially, the last few PCs, can be used to identify \"outliers\".\n  \nHope this is helpful,\nRavi.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n\nRavi Varadhan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, The Center on Aging and Health\n\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology \n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nPh: (410) 502-2619\n\nFax: (410) 614-9625\n\nEmail: rvaradhan@jhmi.edu\n\nWebpage:  http://www.jhsph.edu/agingandhealth/People/Faculty/Varadhan.html\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Mark Difford\nSent: Monday, July 02, 2007 1:55 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Question about PCA with prcomp\n\n\nHi James,\n\nHave a look at Cadima et al.'s subselect package [Cadima worked with/was a\nstudent of Prof Jolliffe, one of _the_ experts on PCA; Jolliffe devotes part\nof a Chapter to this question in his text (Principal Component Analysis,\npub. Springer)].  Then you should look at psychometric stuff: a good place\nto start would be Professor Revelle's psych package.\n\nBestR,\nMark.\n\n\nJames R.
