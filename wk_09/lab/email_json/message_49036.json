One of them provox was written by a \nspeakup list member and is free for download.  Then there's jaws for dos \nalso free for download since it like provox are no longer supported. \nProvox though isopen source though.  Jaws for dos has to be searched out \non the ftp links.  One more thing, if you have at least win2k you don't \nneed win-eyes trial anything for speech.  Thunder screen reader is \navailable free for download for personal home users and nvda which \nrecently had an update is also available free for download and it's open \nsource.  nvda is written in python and may get improved to where it can \nwork with openoffice if the interest is there among the developers.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.8.17/850 - Release Date: 6/15/2007\n11:31 AM\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
