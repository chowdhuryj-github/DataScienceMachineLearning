Why?  More and more systems,\nespecially laptops, are being manufactured without RS232 ports.  When\nI buy my next laptop, I won't let the presence of RS232 be a\ndetermining factor.  The vendors of USB synths won't release their\nproduct information, so these are unsupported.  Thus, I'm not buying\none.  Who wants to do business with people like that anyhow?  So it\nlooks like software speech is the way of the future, at least for me.\nNext, software speech is more convenient, especially when using a\nlaptop.  You have to carry one less peripheral with you.\n\nThe question to ask is this.  Given the decline of hardware synthesis,\nis it really necessary to have speech support within the kernel\nitself?  Software synthesizers run in user mode, so the benefits of a\nspeech-enabled kernel -- notably a talking boot process -- are lost.\n\nComments are welcome.\n\nPS. I'm not a GUI user, so I'm arguing from a console / command-line\nperspective.\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
