I'm running the same program on 4 computers. The core of the \nprogram is a nlm minimization of a function, which is (I believe) nicely \ncoded using (t)apply and all the vectorized stuff.\n\nI'm slightly puzzled by the differences in the speed of computation. The \nprogram works twice as fast on a two years old Celeron (256 MB, running \nUbuntu Dapper Linux) than on a P4 (1GB, Windows 2000 + Novell) and the \nspeed of that Celeron is comparable with an other P4 (1GB, Ubuntu Feisty \nLinux). In general (outside R, text editing, whatever), the Celeron is \nmuch slower than any of the two P4.\n\nIs there any reason for this ? Is R better optimized for Linux ? Some \noptions I might have used when installing R on one of the Linuxes and \nnot on the other one ?\n\nThanks for an answer.\n\nDavid Vonka\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
