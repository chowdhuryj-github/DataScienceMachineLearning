Let me explain a little bit please: I tried to find some \nACL-skilled people who can help me to test this VFS-module first. I had \nalready discussed with Jeremy about we will release this module in \nopensolaris (for me it appears as the Nevada - development branch of \nSolaris 11 - which is periodically released [sources] as open solaris) \nto ensure more testing than this module will be adopted into the samba \ntree. But currently I am trying tho short the period of waiting for the \n3.0.25 release because I am also asked to give this module out for testing.\n\nBest regards\n\nJiri\n\n"}
