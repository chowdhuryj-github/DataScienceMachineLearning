I'm not sure\nthey're free anymore, though.  They're at www.dhis.org.  You'd register\na domain name, and they'd append a .dhis.org to the end.  Unfortunately,\nthey filtered out the mail ports.  Dunno if they still do that, now that\nthey're taking money.  I rememver having to run a key generator, putting\nmy key in the /etc/dhis.conf file, and handing over their key.  It had a\nscript that ran when the machine connected to the net, to let dhis.org\nknow that my system was online.    Only tried it out and never actually \nused it for anything, as I was only interested in having SMTP running.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
