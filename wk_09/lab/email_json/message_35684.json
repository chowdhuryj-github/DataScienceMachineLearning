I live in a state that has enacted the Uniform\nComputer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), which -- among other\nthings -- gives effect[1] to choice of venue clauses in shrink-wrap\nlicenses unless a party can show that the choice is \"unreasonable and\nunjust\".  US courts have made that barrier rather high in practice.\n\nI'm not a fan of judging licenses free because Debian thinks certain\nclauses are moot.  If the clause is in fact moot, the license is\nbuggy.  If the clause is not moot -- at the time of upload or some\npoint afterwards -- it can cause significant harm.\n\nMichael Poole\n\n[1]- http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/ucita/ucita200.htm is a\ncopy; see section 110.\n\n\n"}
