I have\nbeen able to build it with out problems except for one thing.  I am\ncreating a zip file to be installed by the R gui.\n\nI have four directories under the main dir.  I have data, man, R, and\nsrc.  The problem that I have been having, is that the data directory is\nbeing zipped up, then when I  install the package the data directory\nisn't being unzipped when using the gui (This is the main way many of\nthe users that I work with use R).  When I make my call to build the zip\nfill it looks like the following:\n\n>>R CMD build --binary  --use-zip-help --docs=normal batdebug\n\nI have taken out the --use-zip-help flag and I still created the zipped\ndata directory.  I have three items in the data directory, a config file\nand two java files that are invoked by a dll that is in the src\ndirectory.  The three files in the data directory is about 1,200 KB in\ntotal size.  \n\nI have R 1.9.1 installed to build with because it doesn't zip up the\ndata directory like the current version of R.  I have looked into the R\ndocumentation to find if I am not using a flag or something.  I have\ntried the --auto-zip and --use-zip-data flags and neither of these flags\ndid anything different. \n\nI have been experiencing this problem with R 2.4.1 ( I have tried with\nseveral other versions of R and they all do the same thing since 2.0.0.)\n\nCan anyone point me in the correct direction of a flag to include or how\nto fix this problem.\n\nThanks in advance,\nJason E Eglin\nRosetta Inpharmatics\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotice:  This e-mail message, together with any attachments,...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
