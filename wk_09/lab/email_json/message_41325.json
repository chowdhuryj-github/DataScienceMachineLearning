They agree that it *can* be\napplied to non-program works of authorship, and that the result is\nfree software, but I think it's untrue to say it was *designed* to be\napplicable that way.\n\nI agree that the GPL is the best FSF license to be applied to any work\nof authorship, but the FSF don't agree -- and I believe they expressed\nthis disagreement long before they started promoting other licenses\ndesigned for non-program works.\n\nIf you wish to express this argument, I think you'll need to base it\non something other than \"the GPL is designed to be applicable to any\nwork of authorship\".\n\n-- \n \\       \"The generation of random numbers is too important to be left |\n  `\\                                 to chance.\"  -- Robert R.
