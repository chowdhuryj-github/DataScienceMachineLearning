I then ran the \nVMware Virtual Machine Console, as it's called, and created a new VM.  The \nconsole GUI is quite easy to navigate, at least with Window-Eyes.\n    I had previously downloaded a Gentoo ISO, which I used as my cdrom \nimage.  The process of adding a cdrom to the vm is fairly straightforward: \nif someone wants more details I'll add them.\n    I also switched the Ethernet adapter--which is an emulated PCnet32 to \n'bridged' mode, because I happen to be on a private network that can handle \nthat sort of thing.\n    Finally, I booted up the ISO and waited a few seconds, then hit ctrl+g \nto switch the input to the VM.  I gave an ifconfig command to switch eth0 to \nan IP address I knew, changed the password on the root account, and started \nsshd.\n    From that point, I just ssh'd into the VM--after hitting ctrl+alt to \nswitch input back to Windows.  The Gentoo install, including partitioning \nand kernel compilation, went off without a hitch.  I just made sure to start \nsshd at boot, configure the network appropriately, etc.\nI'm glad to answer any questions you may have.  I apologize if this has been \nvague.\nI hope I can help.\nThanks,\nZack. \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
