I'm wondering, then, how Speakup\n: does it?   \n: Thanks much for indulging me,\n: Zack.\n: _______________________________________________\n: Speakup mailing list\n: Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n: http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\nJFW has always done this, and I would guess that WE does too.\nI think Jaws for Dos did too.\nGlenn\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
