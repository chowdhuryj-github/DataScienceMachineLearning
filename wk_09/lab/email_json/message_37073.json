When userAccountControl is set to 544, \nthis user can't authenticate to any shares, and can't bind to LDAP. \nAuthenticating with a XP client to a samba4 domain still works.\n\nWhen userAccountControl is set to 66048 everything works.\n\nI have been doing som research and this propertie means:\n544: Normal user account\n66048: Normal user account: Password never expires.\n\n--\neric\n\n"}
