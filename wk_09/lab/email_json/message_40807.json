These tests generally always pass -- and\n   they did so tonight -- but tonight one test ran with warnings not previously\n   seen . . .\n\n   . . .\n\n   I suspect the problem is to be found either in lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Pmc2cMain.pm\n   or in src/pmc/default.c.  Could whoever has been working on these files in the\n   past few days please take a look at this?  The warnings are of very recent\n   origin.\n\n   Thank you very much.\n   kid51\n\nThis is from the \"Small tweak to Pmc2c.pm\" I posted on 19-May and\ncommitted as r18646 on 26-May.  Note that lib/Parrot/Pmc2c.pm is not\nactually doing anything different now, it's just telling you that none\nof the code for these methods is being used in the generated C file.  So\nthey are certainly not being tested now, and possibly haven't been for a\nwhile.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob Rogers\n\t\t\t\t\t   http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/\n\n"}
