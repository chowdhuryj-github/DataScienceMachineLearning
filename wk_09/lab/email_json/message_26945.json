I have two time series, A with\ndaily data, and another B with data at varying frequencies, but mostly\nannual. Both the series are sorted ascending.\n\nI need to merge these two series together in the following way: For any\nentry of A, the lookup should match with B until we find an entry of B\nthat's larger than A's. \n\nFor all A[i], i = 1,...,N and B[j], j=1,...M\n\nMatch with B[j] where A[i] <= B[j]\n\nWhen A[i] > B[j], match with B[j+1] where A[i] <= B[j+1]\n\nBasically the less-frequent attributes stay true for a stock while the\ndaily prices change.\n\nOne example of this is the vlookup function in Excel with the TRUE\noption. \n\nSo we have an implementation of this in R?\n\nTIA and best,\n-Tir\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
