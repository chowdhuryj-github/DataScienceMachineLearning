The tradeoff is quite large in terms of ease of\nuse and application portability in favor for x86, but yes much higher\npower requirements. If you want to run on battery power for long \nextended periods then ARM makes sense, but then you're talking \nabout a whole different class of applications. If you want portable \nbut mostly plugged in then a 200-300 Mhz PC/104 x86 board is \nvery flexible. I've given up on x86 for this kind of thing but then \nI want something that runs all day on batteries. So as with most \ntech decisions, the answer depends on the requirements. \n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
