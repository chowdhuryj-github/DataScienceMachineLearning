Apparently R and the sas.get function can handle that specification just fine (I have some learning to do myself).

So that's where I would focus to try to solve this problem.  However, I can't replicate the problem on my Windows XP Pro system.  So at this point I can't be of much help.  \n\nSorry I can't be more helpful at this time,\n\nDan \n\nDaniel Nordlund\nBothell, WA USA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
