Only th variable values are there along with thew column headers.\n\nMy target is to merge these 2 text files and create a  new text file preserving the format of the first one becos the subsequent steps of the main program uses the format of the first file. I have to create an id variable that numbers the observations from 1 to 684 and then merge th 2 files with that id, because the first one has the id variable numbered from 1 to 684.\n\nPlease help me to achieve this in R.\n\nRegards\nChandramouli Banerjee\n\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
