For example, instead of saying:\n\n  {\n    foo -> $x {\n      bar;\n      baz -> $y {\n        quux;\n        bizzle;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nWriting that as, say:\n\n  {\n    foo -> $x;\n    bar;\n    baz -> $y;\n    quux;\n    bizzle;\n  }\n\nCan really help readability in situations when the control flow wants\nto look linear.  That's not to say that the -> $x; syntax makes any\nsense.\n\nLuke\n\n"}
