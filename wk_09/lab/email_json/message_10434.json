Trying it again, I got an out-of-memory error\n\nt/stm/llqueue............................\n#     Failed (TODO) test (t/stm/llqueue.t at line 59)\n#          got: 'Parrot VM: PANIC: Out of mem!\n# C file src/gc/memory.c, line 48\n# Parrot file (not available), line (not available)\n# \n# We highly suggest you notify the Parrot team if you have not been working on\n# Parrot.

I haven't been able\nto identify conditions under which it reliably occurs.  I realize this\nis a TODO test, but it shouldn't hang.  Perhaps it should just be skipped.\n\nThis is on Solaris 8/SPARC, with Sun's compiler.\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
