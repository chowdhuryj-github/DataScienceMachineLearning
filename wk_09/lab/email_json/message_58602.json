Before this patch, for every time that the cc_error_handler() was called, strpos() could be run up to three times.  Now, the results of the strpos() checks are cached on a per-filename basis.  The first time a PHP file triggers an error, the strpos() checks are cached, and any subsequent errors triggered by that file use the cached results, skipping strpos().\n\nWhen loading the homepage on a brand new install on my laptop, strpos() was called 3451 times from cc_error_handler() before this patch.  After the patch, it was called 199 times.  These results were gathered using Xdebug/KCacheGrind.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can respond by visiting: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=559968&aid=1745559&group_id=80503\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
