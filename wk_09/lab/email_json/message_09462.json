We want to \nbe, above all, open and fair. Participants that agree to compete can opt to have \ntheir benchmark showcased on a Sun.\nIn the running example, two bodies of JBOD (\"just a \nbunch of disks\" or non-RAID managed storage) are attached to the server. ) SAN and \nFC In the past few years, the amount of data stored throughout the world has been \nincreasing at an incredible speed. Traditionally, server-side web applications have \nfocused on generating HTML documents for every client event that results in a call \nto the server.\nAll commands must be issued by root or by a user \nwith root authority: Determine which devices are available to the local \nsystem.\nFree Sun Studio 11 developer tools for the Solaris \n10 OS - the most advanced operating system on the planet! This pane contains a \nnumber of features, one of which is another arrow set with an arrow pointing up or \ndown. Just above the scroller is the shadow pane.\nThis is a good example of how Ajax can make the \nuser experience better.\nIt is important to note that Leadville is a part of \nthe native Solaris OS. The Solaris iSCSI initiator currently supports iSNS, and \nsupport for this standard is planned for the iSCSI target. Post your performance \nresults to your public website or blog.\nThe number of physical devices that can be attached \nto every FC port is not limited as with SCSI ports.\nFor redundancy and performance, it's useful to have \nmore than one path to a disk. All defined ZFS file systems automatically mount at \nboot time unless otherwise configured. This can avoid manually binding the SCSI \ndevice name to the World Wide Name. Lastly, note the navigation bar on the left of \nFigure 3.\nThe common way to mount a ZFS file system is to \nsimply define it against a pool.\nFigure 1 points out some of these special features. \nThe common way to mount a ZFS file system is to simply define it against a pool. \nPost your performance results to your public website or blog.\nThe Solaris OS includes a FC initiator in the Sun \nStorEdge SAN Foundation Software, commonly known as Leadville.\nIf individual disk partitions are used to build a \nstorage pool, contention could occur between the pool and the partitions not \nincluded in the pool.
