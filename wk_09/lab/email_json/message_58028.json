The plans are to support at\nleast the latest Ubuntu release and the latest LTS release. Currently\n(April 2007), these are Feisty Fawn (7.04) and Dapper Drake (6.06),\nrespectively. Since Feisty was released very shortly before R 2.5.0,\nbinary packages *for this release of R* are also available for Edgy\nEft (6.10).\n\nTo obtain the latest R packages, add an entry like\n\n  deb http://my.favorite.cran.mirror/bin/linux/ubuntu feisty/\n\nor\n\n  deb http://my.favorite.cran.mirror/bin/linux/ubuntu edgy/\n\nor\n\n  deb http://my.favorite.cran.mirror/bin/linux/ubuntu dapper/\n\nin your /etc/apt/sources.list file. See \nhttp://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html\nfor the list of CRAN mirrors. To install the complete R system, use\n\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install r-base\n\nUsers who need to compile packages should also install the r-base-dev\npackage:\n\n  sudo apt-get install r-base-dev\n\nThe R packages for Ubuntu should otherwise behave like the Debian ones. For\nmore information, see the README file in\n\n  http://cran.R-project.org/bin/linux/debian/\n\n* SECURE APT\n\nThe Ubuntu archives on CRAN are signed with the key of \"Vincent Goulet\n\" with key ID E2A11821. You can fetch\nthis with\n\n  gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-key E2A11821\n\nand then you feed the key to apt-key with\n\n  gpg -a --export E2A11821 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nSome people have reported difficulties using this approach. The issue\nwas usually related to a firewall blocking port 11371. An alternative\napproach is to search for the key at http://keyserver.noreply.org/ and\ncopy the key to a plain text file, say key.txt. Then, feed the key to\napt-key with\n\n  sudo apt-key add key.txt\n\n\n* ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe Debian R packages are maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Spie Bates.\nThe Ubuntu packages are compiled for i386 by Vincent Goulet.\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
