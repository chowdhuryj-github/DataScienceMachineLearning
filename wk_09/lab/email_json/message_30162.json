Especially on systems like HP-UX 11.11, where\nif we don't expose a function\n(like strtoull - it's buried as an internal function in __strtoull) it\nMAY be because it's behavior is not strictly compliant...\nOn 11.23 it IS exposed, and if it isn't working correctly, we'd want to\nknow.\nBetter to find this out early - it's a real pain to track it down once\nit passes build.\nDon \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Andrew Bartlett [mailto:abartlet@samba.org] \nSent: Tuesday, May 15, 2007 2:40 AM\nTo: samba-technical@lists.samba.org\nCc: McCall, Don (GSE-WTEC-Alpharetta)\nSubject: Should the tests in LOCAL-REPLACE be part of configure?\n\nI've been chasing down the build farm issues in LOCAL-REPLACE, and in\nparticular on our HP-UX machines. \n\nIt seems that our tests for strtoull behaviour are very, very strict,\nand if we are going to test for such strictness later, we should also\nreplace systems that fail these tests in the first place.\n\nIs there any reason not to try and include these into a runtime test?\n\nAndrew Bartlett\n-- \nAndrew Bartlett\nhttp://samba.org/~abartlet/\nAuthentication Developer, Samba Team           http://samba.org\nSamba Developer, Red Hat Inc.                  http://redhat.com\n\n"}
