The \ncode might run for a few more lines, but the problem is here. Your \nmysubset2, btw. we have no idea what that might be, aparently does not \nhave 2 dimensions.\n\nBesides, your code is very dirty and it is indeed very easy to make a \nmistake in such code.\n\nYou really should start reading some introductory manual as someone \nsuggested before. You are not likely to recieve more (different) answers \nto questions of this kind.\n\nPetr\n\n> myVariableWidths<-c(5,2,1,2,1,12.4)\n> df<-read.fwf(\n> file=myfile,\n> width=myVariableWidths,\n> col.names=myVariableNames,\n> row.names=\"PUMFID\",\n> fill=TRUE,\n> strip.white=TRUE)\n> \n> happyguys<-subset(df, PROV==48 & GRADE == 7  & Y_Q10A < 9)\n> print(happyguys)\n> \n> \n> where it is bolded, i'm getting the following error: Error in mysubset2[, \n> 2:5] : incorrect number of dimensions\n\n\n\n-- \nPetr Klasterecky\nDept. of Probability and Statistics\nCharles University in Prague\nCzech Republic\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
