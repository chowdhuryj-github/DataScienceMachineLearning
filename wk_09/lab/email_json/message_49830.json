I'm about to get a LiteTalk here this week \nand and install Slackware.  An extra 7 to 10 Gig dual-boot partition is \na darned good one.  I was planning on running a dual-boot setup to the \nsame kernal, hopefully using the append command in lilo to boot \ndifferent runlevels.  Have a coupleset aside for emergency boots to \nsoftware synth emulation in one runlevel, etc...if lilo supports it. \nHaving an emergency diagnostic partition is even better.  Thanks Spie.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
