Think again. At Yodlee, we're taking a whole new look at what the Internet can do to transform the way people access, manage, interact with, and transact upon their finances to enable greater insights, control, and 'action'. Come join our revolution...\n \nYodlee today powers online and mobile financial solutions used by nearly 8 million consumers at more than 30 of the top 50 global financial institutions. At Yodlee, you will be working with the latest Web 2.0 technologies, building out a complex infrastructure to support millions of payments and transactions each day across a rapidly growing global network, built from scratch by Yodlee. As an ASP with stringent up-time requirements and enormous scalability and security issues, Yodlee offers unique challenges for developers. Our systems have to scale from mere hundreds to 10s of millions of users. We don't run vast datacenters - our systems have to provide speed, with minimal hardware, and support half a million e-Commerce sessions per hour with sub second response times. \n \nIf you're looking for an environment where innovation and creative approaches are valued, where there are no boundaries for what can be accomplished, and where your work will ultimately transform the online experience for millions of people, then look no further. Yodlee is the place for you!\nhttp://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=sponsors&d2=yodlee\n \nCheck out more information about all that Yodlee has to offer: www.yodlee.com\n**********************************************************************\n\nBest of luck to you in the Arena!\n\n- The TopCoder Competitions Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of TopCoder competitions.
