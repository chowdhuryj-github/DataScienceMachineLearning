I don't know if I\nwould consider a modified GPL that only offered the 3b option to be free; I\nsuspect I would not.  So even though GPL itself is free, that doesn't mean\nthat any element of the GPL taken alone is also free.\n\nAnd it wasn't my point to try to claim that 3b was free, my point was about\nwhether quantitative differences should impact our decisions about the\nfreeness of two otherwise identical licenses.  Apparently I should have\npicked a better example.\n\n-- \nSteve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\nDebian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\nvorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
