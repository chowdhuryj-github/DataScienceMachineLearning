Applied in r18461, r18462, r18465, r18466, r18467, r18468, and \nr18469.\n\nA comment: this patch was in essence three patches (the pod, a test and \na patch of the headers), next time could you separate them into three \npatches?  The test was itself actually a new file, so it could have \njust been attached rather than a patch made of it.  Also, when you add \na new file, could you also update MANIFEST as well?  These are meant as \npositive critisms; you've done great work and your help is greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks again,\n\nPaul\n\n"}
