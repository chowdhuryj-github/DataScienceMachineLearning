The new catalog contains many new reagents for PCR, cloning, expression and purification, as well as up-to-date technical charts and protocols to aid in your experimental design.Highlighted products include:11 new restriction enzymes17 restriction enzyme unit size increasesA new Competent Cell chapterA new Epigenetics chapterA growing line of DNA PolymerasesPreCR Repair Mix for damaged DNA templateDNA Ladders in convenient formatsA selection of expression systems (yeast, mammalian and E. coli)High efficiency transfection reagentsMany new reagents for RNA research \n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nTechnical Info on PreCRGenesearch\nNew England Bioloabs\nAustralian Price List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreCR\u2122 Repair MixRepair damaged DNA prior to PCR, microarrays or other technologies.The PreCR Repair Mix is an enzyme cocktail formulated to repair damaged template DNA prior to its use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarrays or other DNA technologies. This product comes with easy-to-use protocols and does not damage template DNA.DNA is susceptible to many types of damage resulting from exposure to a variety of chemical or environmental reagents, manipulation or simply aging, which prevent the further manipulation of DNA. The PreCR Repair Mix is a blend of recombinant proteins designed to repair damaged template DNA prior to its use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarrays or other DNA technologies. PreCR is active on a broad range of DNA damage, including those that block PCR (e.g. apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, thymine dimers, nicks and gaps) and those that are mutagenic (e.g. deaminated cytosine and 8-oxo-guanine). In addition, it will remove a variety of moieties from the 3\u00b4 end of DNA leaving a hydroxyl group. However the PreCR Repair Mix cannot repair fragmentation or protein-DNA crosslinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\tPreCR ResultsThis gel illustrates repair of different types of DNA damage with the PreCR Repair Mix. The gel shows trial ampli\ufb01cations from damaged DNA that was either not treated (-) or treated (+) with the PreCR Repair Mix. Type of DNA damage is shown. Note: heat treated DNA is incubated at 99\u00b0C for 3 minutes. Marker M is the 2-log DNA Ladder (NEB #N3200).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPreCR FeaturesEasy-to-use protocols. Amplification can be done directly on the repair reaction, or, if the polymerase being used is not active in ThermoPol Buffer, a sequential reaction protocol is provided. Does not harm template DNACan be used in conjunction with any thermophilic DNA Polymerase.A typical reaction involves a 15-20 minute incubation at 37\u00b0C with the supplied components. In some cases, to achieve maximum amplicon yield optimization of the PreCR reaction may be required. This involves varying the amount of template and incubation temperature. Template concentration does not appear to be a limiting factor in this reaction. Each PreCR reaction can repair anywhere from 0.01 ng to 1 \u00b5g of damaged DNA. \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout GenesearchGenesearch is an Australian company founded in 1980.
