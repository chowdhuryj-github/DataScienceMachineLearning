True, rnd costs might have been an\nissue in the beginning, along with the size of the market the products\nare aimed at, but let's take for example the screen reader\nmanufacturers for the other popular os. With the kinds of prices they\ncharge, and given the large amount of sails they've most likely made\nover their product's lifetime, I would have thought they've recovered\ntheir rnd costs long, long ago, and then some. No, I think that what's\ndriving prices of A.T. for the most part these days is pure and simple\ngreed, not to mention that these companies' biggest customer is the\nU.S. government, and that it has deep pockets to boot, from the\nperspective of the companies.\n\nGreg\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Jun 24, 2007 at 07:58:43PM +0100, Gaijin wrote:\n>      I can understand that.
