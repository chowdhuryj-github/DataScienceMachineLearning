Then I run the two models.\n\nNow I want to shuffle the data and rerun the models. I want many shuffles.\n\nI know that the following command\n\nsample ((1:10000), ntrain)\n\ncan pick ntrain numbers from 1 to 10000. Then I just use these rows as the\ntraining dataset.\n\nBut how can I make sure each run of sample  produce different results? I\nwant the data output be unique each time.\nI tested sample(). and found it usually produce different combinations. But\ncan I control it some how? Is there a better way to write this?\n\nThank you,\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
