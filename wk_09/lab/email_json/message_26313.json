Only if I touch my touchpad with a finger or the tip\nof the thumb, it moves the mouse, switches focus etc. but if I\naccidentally touch it with my palm or the side of my thumb the contact\nis ignored and doesn't disrupt typing -- very cool.\n\nmulti-finger detection: I can configure my touchpad so that tapping with\ntwo fingers is interpreted as a middle mouse click, three fingers are a\nright mouse click etc. Especially useful for touchpads without middle\nmouse button.\n\nI thought that all modern touchpads would offer these features, but\nrecently learned that this is not the case or that at least not all\ntouchpads have linux drivers that support those.\n\nHTH,\nJohannes\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGQfSvC1NzPRl9qEURAj/0AJ9jvuW6jKEba8JKGRLEHYtp/GsEmQCdEfOP\n0n1xuzC1eo/ZQDgIIjelyqc=\n=ozOS\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
