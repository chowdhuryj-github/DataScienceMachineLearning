Its potential usefulness is clear.\n\nI broadly agree with the comments that have been made about the\nvarious approaches (with/without awk/sed/R etc).\n\nIs there any URL that leads to a fuller explicit exposition of Vilno?\n\nAs I said previously, a web-search on \"vilno\" leads to very little\nthat is relevant. What I did find didn't amount to much.\n\nBest wishes,\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 13-Jun-07                                       Time: 10:00:12\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
