It turns out that the list of files\nis computed from the MANIFEST, and I was searching through\nfiles in the config/ subdirectory (where most other configuration-like\nitems tend to be placed).\n\nIs MANIFEST the correct file for determining which .pir files\nshould automatically be converted to .pbc ?\n\nAnd if it is (or even if it isn't but we decide to keep it\nthis way for some time), could/should there be a note in the\ngenerated root Makefile that indicates that GEN_LIBRARY is\nbeing generated from entries in the MANIFEST?\n\nThanks,\n\nPm\n\n"}
