I think the MCMClogit in\nthe MCMCpack needs some development so that the response in the formula\ncould be set as a two-column matrix with the columns giving the numbers of\nsuccesses and failures (just as in glm) or at least to be able to set the\nweights also when using the response vector.\nThe advantage would be when analysing large datasets (over 1 million rows)\nto have it summarized and entered as a matrix because otherwise it takes a\nhuge amount of memory space and crashes the program (if trying to expand the\nmatrix into a response vector to have it in the formula. \nAfter all, the bayesian logistic regression is especially useful in large\ndatasets. Is there a way to do that?
