From  ?setOldClass:\n....\nDescription:\n\n     Register an old-style (a.k.a. `S3') class as a formally defined\n     class. The 'Classes' argument is the character vector used as the\n     'class' attribute; in particular, if there is more than one\n     string,  old-style class inheritance is mimicked.  Registering via\n     'setOldClass' allows S3 classes to appear  in method signatures,\n     and as a slot in an S4 class if a prototype is included.\n...\n\n(2) This question may be more appropriate for r-devel?\n\nHTH,\n\n--\nDavid\n\n\nOn 6/1/07, adschai@optonline.net  wrote:\n> Hi - I tried to get some answer before but there seems to have no one response.
