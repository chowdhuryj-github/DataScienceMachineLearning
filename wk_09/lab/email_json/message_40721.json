You\ncan also obtain the source code online... .\"\n\nJust saying 'download the sources' does not meet the requirements of\nGPLv2. Writing an offer means that you won't have to worry about it\nuntil someone actually requests it.\n-- \nAndrew Donnellan\najdlinuxATgmailDOTcom (primary)    ajdlinuxATexemailDOTcomDOTau (secure)\nhttp://andrewdonnellan.com         http://ajdlinux.wordpress.com\najdlinux@jabber.org.au             hkp://subkeys.pgp.net 0x5D4C0C58\n            http://linux.org.au    http://debian.org\n        Get free rewards - http://ezyrewards.com/?id=23484\n        Spammers only === ajdspambucket@exemail.com.au ===\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
