But we don't \n      really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of \n      Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks \n      to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into \n      the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable \n      insights.\u00a0Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and \n      will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the \n      freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis past week was also the \n      deadliest in Baghdad \u2013 over 200 Iraqis were killed in \n      a single day.\u00a0 It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying \n      to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports \n      in our second story.\u00a0How does one live in such a place?\u00a0 Very \n      carefully, reports Logan, and often with \n      the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the \n      U.S. military.\u00a0Nearly 200 \n      doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on \n      destroying Iraqi society.\u00a0Soon after bullets began to crash through \n      his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound.\u00a0\"We heard the \n      helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, \n      Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'\"\n\u00a0\nWatch Logan's Reporter's \n      Notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe firing of Don Imus for \n      uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely \n      use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its \n      dark messages.\u00a0 As you\u2019ll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that \n      one of the rappers\u2019 popular messages, \"stop snitchin',\" does not help the \n      police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve \n      crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless \n      neighborhoods.\u00a0 Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence \n      advocate from New York City\u2019s Harlem neighborhood, \"It\u2019s like we\u2019re saying to the \n      criminals, 'You can have our community\u2026.Do anything you want and we will \n      either deal with it ourselves or we\u2019ll simply ignore \n      it.'\"\n\u00a0\nWatch Cooper's Reporter's \n      Notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThese stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with \n      books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. \n      ET/PT.\n\n\u00a0\nFor an early look at this \n      week\u2019s stories, please click \n      here.\n\u00a0\n      \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\u00a0\n"}
