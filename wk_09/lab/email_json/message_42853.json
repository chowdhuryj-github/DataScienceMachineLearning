Larry may jump in and answer others. \n\nYes you can run other applications on the Icon.  Most all of it's\ncurrent facilities are written in python but it comes with speakup and\nyou can drop into a console and run whatever you like.  It is using a\ncommon embedded packaging system called open embedded.  The synth it\nuses is via voice or FlexTalk so it is proprietary but somebody could\nport espeak or something else to it if they liked.\n\nThe python code is compiled so it is also proprietary but there are\npython decompilers available if somebody with the experience wanted to\ntake it apart to get the source.  I haven't had the time to devote to\nit as much as I'd like to.\n\n  Kirk\n\n-- \n\nKirk Reiser\t\t\t\tThe Computer Braille Facility\ne-mail: kirk@braille.uwo.ca\t\tUniversity of Western Ontario\nphone: (519) 661-3061\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
