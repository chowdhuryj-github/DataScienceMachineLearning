My\nmodules do eventually get installed but not w/o several admonitions that\nusing /usr/bin/ftp may cause \"...problems that are hard to diagnose\"\n\nI'm not sure where else to go with this. It looks like I can eventually\nget what I need installed, but not without a long bumpy ride first.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
