The\nportland project is working to make a cross-GNOME+KDE\nsystem: \n\nhttp://www.scheinwelt.at/~norbertf/dadapt/files/xdg_utils/doc/libxdg-vfs.html\n\nThe question is what type of module will allow us to\nget access to ccHost? WebDAV or another?\n\nThis is a high priority for being able to get content\nshuttled directly from the desktop to an installation\nand I think would get a lot of people who would like to\nswitch up to ccHost.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: Jon Phillips (kidproto)\nDate: 2007-05-16 11:32\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=914868\nOriginator: YES\n\nBruno is working on this for Summer of Code on Inkscape with Bryce...cool!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Jon Phillips (kidproto)\nDate: 2007-02-07 16:08\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=914868\nOriginator: YES\n\nYes, true...I believe that the standard GTK/GTKMM dialogs allow this.

It's also fairly cross-platform, and (I think)\nwould work ok via gnome-vfs and other vfs tools.\n\nThere might be FUSE-based options out there, but I've only\nhad limited experience with FUSE.\n\nMost other options I know of are either going to be\nchallenging to set up, too slow, or too platform-specific.\n\nOne thing to think about is in addition to desktop ->\nccHost, of providing ccHost -> desktop functionality.  It'd\nbe useful to be able to have a bunch of desktops that\nautomatically update from the ccHost server automatically. \nThere's several ways to solve it (rsync's, svn, etc.) but if\nit can be done with the same approach as uploading, then you\nkill two birds with one stone.  ;-)\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can respond by visiting: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=559969&aid=1521535&group_id=80503\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
