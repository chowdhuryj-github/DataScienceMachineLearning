Do you know if they have any funding ideas /\n> experiments going on? I would be happy to throw ideas around along those\n> lines.\n\nEssentially the way we're handling it now is with allowing the bands\nto handle a lot of the monetizing themselves. We release the music\nourselves through multitude venues (local stores which play the music\nand give away or sell CDs, priority radio time set aside for free\nmusic by college stations, distributed through our website and on\nother review sites) and promote and hold shows for the bands under our\nlabel. We have a small amount of seed money from successful shows\nwe've had and initial funding that I and a few others have provided.\nWith that we're pressing limited runs of vinyl and cd-rs to give to\nthe band for free. in turn, the band sells them at their shows and on\ntheir website and keeps all of the money from any sales with no\nobligation to pay us back. If they'd like more materials, we're happy\nto order them, and this is just the first sort of experiment in how to\nfund the creation of free music.\n\nThe studio time is donated to us by college radio stations (they\nobviously have a vested interest, both in charter and\nself-preservation, in 'funding' free content) and the production is\ntaken care of by the recording artist, a tech at the station, or an\nindependent producer/company that has donated us time.\n\nWe've been able to involve /a lot/ of larger named bands, partially as\nwe're curating music to be distributed with the first shipments of\nOLPCs as part of their free content packages.\n\nbest\nChristopher (typically a lurker)\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
