You do not state \"IANAL\" and therefore we conclude\nthat you are \"certified\" to practice law in every jurisdiction in which\ndebian-legal is read ... or did you think Italian law permits a foreign\nattorney to provide legal advice by email concerning Italian law to an\nItalian citizen in Italy?  Guess you're going to have to plan vacations\nkind of carefully to avoid all those countries where you're now a felon.\nAs an officer of the court, you will be promptly confessing your crimes\nto your state bar association, right?\n\nPersonally, IANAL.  I don't give legal advice.  I argue law all I want.\n\n--Mike Bird\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
