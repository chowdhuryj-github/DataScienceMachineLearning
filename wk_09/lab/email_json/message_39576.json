Yesterday Gerry and Kate McCann met the Pope. Later this week they will travel to Madrid.\n\n\nEveryone will sympathise with the McCanns' plight. But some are beginning to feel uneasy about their campaign and the coverage it is getting. Is the media right to continue to give their story such prominence? And is the intervention of figures like Zombie Brown, David Beckham and the Pope appropriate?\n\n\nClick here to comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
