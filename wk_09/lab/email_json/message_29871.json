I write:\n\nmy %h = (\n\tx => 100,\n\ty => 75,\n\tz => 99,\n    );\n\nexplicitly writing the \"unrequired\" comma on the last element\n(z=>99).  That way, if I add another element to the hash there's\nno danger that I will forget to go back and add the comma to\nthe line above.  Alternately, if I reorder the hash elements\n(maybe sorting on the value instead of the key) I don't have\nto check whether there is now a commaless line in the middle\nof the reordered bunch.\n\n-- \n\n"}
