I thought it was cool to \nhave all this connectivity, and all the granduer of linux\nand other nix with all their free network software.\n\nNow I do this, when I go to sleep or am not actually on\nmy computer I press the button on my cable modem \nthat shuts off the network. No network means nothing \nto scan and find. If I walk out the door I now actually\nshutdown my computer. I have bios password. I have\nbios set to not boot from anything but the hard drive.\nI have restricted parm in lilo, which means you cannot\nenter boot parms. Perhaps I am paranoid but after \nbeing hacked one becomes jittery.\n\nI used to proudly proclaim that I never get viruses \nand such because I was smart, then I was humbled.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
