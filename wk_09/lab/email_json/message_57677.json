Basically, we want to be able to do something like:\n>\n> perl t/codingstd/perlcritic.t --list\n> --policy=CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs=>{'allow_leading_tabs'=>0}\n>\n> and it to give the output:\n>\n> CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs => \\{\n>    'allow_leading_tabs' => 0\n>  }\n>   \nIsn't that reimplementing 'perlcritic' ?\nIf somebody wants to work on satisfying a new policy one can set up a\nmy_perlcriticrc file and call\n\n   perlcritic --profile my_perlcriticrc\n\nAnother question. Can we simplify perlcritic.t by using Test::Perl::Critic?\n\nJust my $0.02,\n  Bernhard\n\n"}
