Most seemed like scams that told me I had \"hundreds of critical errors\", which is BS. This Registry Cleaner gave me a detailed list of what was wrong, with no hyperbole, and what it was going to do to fix it. Then it fixed it, no muss no fuss! I especially like that the Free* trial version will fix up to 20 different errors without having to buy the software, that's a nice touch. My system starts up like lightning now, just like when I first installed Windows! \n\u0017Steve Winter\n\n \n \n\nto be removed\n23316 NE Redmond Fall-City Road #667\nRedmond, WA 98053\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are subscribed to nazarianmittienix.net with the email address kahlia@speedy.uwaterloo.ca.\nIf you wish to be excluded from future nazarianmittienix.net mailings,\nplease click here\nor write us at:\n287 S.
