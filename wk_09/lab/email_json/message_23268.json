Familiarity with these principles \nand methods is now essential to managing all of the major resources and \ncommitments in the electric power industry, including fuel and power purchase \ncontracts, generation resources, retail service agreements, and regulatory \npolicies (e.g., Provider of Last Resort obligations). Participants will study \nthe financial ?building blocks?? elementary forward and option contracts. \nTrainers will explain how the value and risk of non-financial contracts and \nphysical assets can be understood in terms of equivalent combinations of \nelementary contracts. With these principles, participants will study methods for \nvaluing forward contracts and options, both simple and complex; modeling \nuncertainty in market prices; and estimating volatility. Finally, participants \nwill learn about the basic risk management strategies, as well as how to \ncalculate risk exposures and measure portfolio risk.\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Outline:\n\n\nThe course addresses concepts, instruments, and methods for measuring \n\t\tand managing risk in energy commodity markets.
