In FC7 the experience should be much better.\nRight now I am running always with SELinux enforcing and 3.0.24 was\nperfectly happy after my last week work with Dan on the policies.\n\nIf you have any non-working case for FC6/FC7 let me know and I will make\nsure policies are updated.\n\nIf the machine policies are not updated there are many cases where samba\nsimply breaks for non trivial configurations, and there is nothing you\ncan except disabling SELinux if a policy update is refused.\n\nSimo.\n\n-- \nSimo Sorce\nSamba Team GPL Compliance Officer\nemail: idra@samba.org\nhttp://samba.org\n\n"}
