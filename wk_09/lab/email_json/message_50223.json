It's simple enough for me to use update.packages() as a user\nwhich will download the appropriate packages.  Though they won't be\ninstalled, they are all in the one place in the /tmp/ directory from\nwhere I can install them as root.  I just thought there must be a more\nelegant way to set permissions so that users could write to the\nsubdirectories under /usr/local/R-2.xxx/.  So much of the installation\nprocess of R and its packages is so elegant, I'd like to retain some\nof that elegance.\n\nbest\n\n-- \n~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.   \n   ___    Patrick Connolly   \n {~._.~}          \t\t Great minds discuss ideas    \n _( Y )_  \t  \t        Middle minds discuss events \n(:_~*~_:) \t       \t\t Small minds discuss people  \n (_)-(_)  \t                           .....
