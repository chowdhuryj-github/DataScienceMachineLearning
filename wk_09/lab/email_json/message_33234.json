I made the following rule:\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\nThe only problem with this, is it drops all pings incoming as well, which causes a slight problem.\nAny way around this?\nAlso, is there anything else that can be done in order to make the system more secure? I was told to block fragmented packets. I know what they are, but don't know enough about tcp in order to be able to do much with them.\nHelp is appriciated.\nThanks,\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
