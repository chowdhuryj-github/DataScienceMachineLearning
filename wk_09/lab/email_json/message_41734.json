Is the synth too loud or too low?\nIf too loud, you can decrease the GenericAdd and GenericMultiply values - let's \nsay to50.\nIf it's to low, you can change the default volume in speechd.conf to a \nvalue between 0 an 100.\nOr you can try to change the values in the GenericExecute string in \nespeak-generic.conf. Instead of $VOLUME you can try to insert a specific \nvalue.\nI guess you have to experiment a bit. I figured out my favorite values this \nway.\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
