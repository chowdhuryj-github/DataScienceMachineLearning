Ideally, at either level multiple W matrices could be included and X1 and X2 could be (partly) different (or X2 could be absent). But the most important thing is to be able to include a count/proportion response variable in the autocorrelation model. \n\nDoes anyone know of a function in a package to estimate such a model? I have found some functions that capture small parts of this, but especially the option of a \"generalized\" model with a count reponse hasn't shown up yet. But perhaps it exists under names I am not familiar with.\n\nthanks a lot,\nHank Stevens (PhD. student)\n\n\n\n\nhttp://toolbar.Care2.com  Make your computer carbon-neutral (free).\n\nhttp://www.Care2.com  Green Living, Human Rights and more - 7 million members!\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
