You can assign names to the equations via\n  names(eqn),\nbut this is not necessary, you can simply pass the equations with\n  systemfit(eqns=eqn...........),\nand optionally specify the names of the equations with eqnlabels=.... \ninstead.\n\nIf you want multiple systemfit calls for subsets of the equations, you \nshould be able to select the equations via [], e.g.,\neqns=eqn[1:2] for the first and second equation.\n\nHTH,\n\n  Martin\n\n> I would want demand to be \"AUD\", supply to be \"CHF\", etc. If someone has\n> time to run the code, they would see what I mean. \n> Thanks a lot.\n> --------------------------------------------------------\n>\n> This is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
