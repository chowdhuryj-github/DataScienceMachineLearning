That's bound to confuse a future\nreader of your code (which may end up being yourself)\n\n> {\n>      print \"<$value---> $coins{$value}>\\n\";\n>\n> }\n>\n> so now is hash is printing in sorted order....like\n> <987658---> 35.5>\n>  45.4>\n> <456hn---> 56.4>\n> <34567---> 78.9>\n> <12345---> 91>\n>  99.8>\n> <00000---> 99.9>\n>\n> wat i need is for ex if i gave 34567 it has to tell the position of\n> the hash 4th position...\n\nYou're asking for Perl to tell you something that's not true.  34567\nis NOT at the \"fourth position\".  It's not at any such numbered\nposition.  34567 is a key whose value in %coins is 78.9.\n\n> how can i do that.....\n\nSounds to me like what you really want is to get a list of keys in\nsome particular order (like the one you imposed in your foreach loop\nabove), find the position of one particular key in the sorted list of\nkeys.  That's not the same thing as finding the position of one\nparticular key in the hash itself.  Here's one way:\n\nmy $i = 0;\nforeach my $key (sort {$coins{$a} cmp $coins{$b} } keys %coins)\n{\n     $i++;\n     print \"$key is at position $i\\n\" if $key eq '34567';\n}\n\nHere's another:\nmy $i = 0;\nmy %position_of = map { $_ => ++$i } sort {$coins{$a} cmp $coins{$b} }\nkeys %coins;\nprint \"Position of '34567' is $position_of {34567}\\n\";\n\nHope this helps,\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
