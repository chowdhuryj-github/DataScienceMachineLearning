I agree that grid\nobjects would be a more elegant way to implement these ...\n(The standard argument is that \"thermometers\" or mini-barplots\nwould be a better way to view this information, but I agree that\npie charts seem familiar to people.)  I have the feeling that I've\nseen pie-charts-on-maps somewhere ... searching the R Graphics Gallery\nfor \"pie\" also produces the \"hexbin pie\" plot (which doesn't\nuse grid either ...)\n\n  Ben Bolker\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
