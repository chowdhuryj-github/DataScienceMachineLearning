We\nasked the FSF how to apply the GFDL and were told that the *entire\ncollection of manpages* counted as the Work, so it was okay to put the\nInvariant Sections in separate manpages.  See\nhttp://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-11/msg00311.html et seq.\n\nI'm not a fan of the GFDL, and I'm very happy to see Debian finally\nthrowing all of the FSF's documentation into non-free where it\nbelongs, but I don't think you need to worry about GFDL manpages being\nundistributable (at least, as long as they come from FSF projects; one\ncould easily have a copyright holder not buy the above reasoning).\n\nzw\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
