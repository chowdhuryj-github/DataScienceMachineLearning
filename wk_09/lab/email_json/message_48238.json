Cash market traders looking to better \n\t\ttimed purchases and sales \n\t\t? For-profit traders looking for a disciplined method of trade execution \n\t\tand exits \n\t\t? Analysts who wish to add \"charting\" to their fundamental or \n\t\tquantitative views \n\t\t? Hedgers seeking insight as to the timing of short term hedges\n\n\t\tA question often asked is \"I have no experience with technical analysis, \n\t\tis this class for me?\" The class begins with the basics of charting and \n\t\tis designed for those who know what a futures contract is and perhaps \n\t\thave some experience with the cash market or hedging but no knowledge of \n\t\ttechnical trading.\n\n\t\tThe class will teach techniques that will be helpful not only for those \n\t\twho wish to trade futures for profit, but also for cash market \n\t\tparticipants and hedgers who must time transactions.\n\n\t\tA typical class attendee has had some exposure to the market, usually on \n\t\tthe physical side, or as a support person, but lacks an understanding of \n\t\tthe technical. Those who do have experience trading futures, but need a \n\t\tmore rigorous, disciplined approach to doing so will find this class \n\t\tgives them the structure to approach the markets more methodically. \n\t\tFinally, those tasked with market analysis and forecasting will find the \n\t\tanalytical techniques taught helpful to developing a more accurate \n\t\tmarket view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.
