You can participate via usenet instead of a mailing\nlist (and that gives you more flexibility in protecting your e-mail\naddress).  However, I don't know if a usenet reply (such as this one)\nis reflected back to the mailing list (anyone?)\n\n\n--\nThe best way to get a good answer is to ask a good question.\nDavid Filmer (http://DavidFilmer.com)\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
