Our reporter, Garry Richardson, has been following referee Graham Poll in what has turned out to be his last season.  \n\n\nYou'll remember it was Poll who made one of the most public refereeing mistakes in history, giving three yellow cards to the same Croatian player at the World Cup Finals last year. \n\n\nIt was not long after that error that we began to follow him. \n\n\nThe really interesting thing about the documentary is that you see a very different side of Poll - he's viewed by many as an arrogant man who likes to be the centre of attention on the pitch. But we show you the other side of the man, the private side, the side that has doubts - so you can judge him for yourself.\n\n\n* He relives the moment he found out he'd made that mistake at the World Cup Finals and how it motivated him to keep going.\n\n\n* He gives his view of the season-long controversy between him and Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho.\n\n\n* He explains why he sent off Everton's James McFadden and how disappointed he was by Everton's repsonse.\n\n\n* He gives his side of the story of when he sent off Chelsea and England captain, John Terry.\n\n\n*He admits match officials made a mistake that led to a crucial goal against Charlton at Christmas last year.\n\n\n*He criticises the FA for not protecting referees against players and managers enough and says much tougher action needs to be taken against those who misbehave.\n\n\n* And he tells us what he was feeling just after he had refereed his last ever professional game - the play off final last Monday.\n\n\nIt's a gripping watch - well worth staying up for.\n\n\nSo join me for Inside Sport at 2305 BST, BBC ONE.\n\n\n\nGabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 4 June, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and second edition, Sunday 10 June, 1130 BST on BBC TWO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS WEEK ON BBC SPORT\n\u00a0All the TV and radio times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSIDE SPORT\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/insidesport\nMonday\n\nGabby Logan hosts the big names and stories (2305, BBC ONE) \n\nSunday \nAnother chance to see the show (1130, BBC TWO) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOTBALL ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/football\nWednesday \nMatch of the Day: Highlights of Euro 2008 qualifier Estonia v England (2240, BBC ONE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE SPORT ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/tvandradio\nMonday\nFrench Open Tennis (1100-1800, Radio Five Live Sports Extra; 1100-1900 BBCi)\n\nTuesday\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1100-1800, Radio Five Live Sports Extra; 1100-1900 BBCi)\nWednesday\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1100-1800, Radio Five Live Sports Extra; 1100-1900 BBCi)\nThursday\n\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 3rd Test, Old Trafford (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\n\nFrench Open Tennis (1300-1900, BBCi)\nFriday\n\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 3rd Test, Old Trafford (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\n\nSports Extra Rugby League (1955, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online)\nFrench Open Tennis (1200-1900, BBCi)\nSaturday\nFrench Open Tennis: Women's Final (1400, BBC ONE; 1000-1900, BBCi)\n\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 3rd Test, Old Trafford (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\n\nRugby league: Challenge Cup quarter-final St Helens v Warrington (1210, BBC ONE), Rugby League Forum (1400-1430, BBCi)\nMoto GP: qualifying session (1255-1400, BBCi)\nSunday\nFrench Open Tennis: Men?s Final (1600, BBC TWO; 1000-1900, BBCi) \n\nMoto GP: Catalunya (1230, BBC TWO; 1350, BBCi)\nTest Cricket: England v West Indies, 3rd Test, Old Trafford (Test Match Special, 1045-1800, Radio 4 LW; 1030-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra/online; 1030-1900 BBCi)\n\nRugby league: Challenge Cup quarter-final Bradford v Huddersfield (1400, BBC TWO)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...AND ON THE WEBSITE THIS WEEK\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/sport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWimbledon photo competition\n\u00a0Your photos of the Spirit of Summer Sport\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPoll on that World Cup mistake\n\u00a0Graham Poll looks back on giving Josip Simunic three yellow cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/sport_newsletter\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:sport.online@bbc.co.uk?subject=newsletter\n\nProblems with links?
