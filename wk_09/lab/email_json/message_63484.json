We should not list there every single \nchange we do to the code (that's git log), just stuff which is \ninteresting for testers and users.\n\nHere is how I'm going to organize the process for the modules I'm \nhandling releases for. Maintainers of other modules are encouraged to \nuse the same format.\n\nWhen you commit something news worthy add an entry at the top of the \nNEWS file. I will add the snapshot number when I release it.\n\n* Put your irc nick at the end of the entry.\n* Please be picky about the format so that we don't end up with a mess \nand it's also easily parsable. I will add a sanity check to \nmaint-helper.py and activities setup.py at some point to ensure this.\n* It's not in the examples before but if you are fixing a ticket add it \nat the beginning of the entry as #12345.\n\nFor sugar, sugar-datastore, sugar-artwork, hulahop:\n\nNEWS ---\n\n< Add an entry here >\n\nSnapshot de8b3b4c01\n\n* Use HAL to get battery informations. (marco)\n* Improvements in the mesh view layout. (marco)\n* Hide the active palette when another popup. (tomeu)\n* Icons in the buddy menu items. (edsiper)\n\n---\n\nFor journal-activity, web-activity, xbook, write:\n\nNEWS ---\n\n< Add an entry here >\n\n23\n\n* Fix refresh issues. (tomeu)\n* Fix journal icon in the bottom bar. (tomeu)\n* Implement back bar in the detailed view. (tomeu)\n\n---\n\nPlease do it, it will help testing a lot. Also it will be a good way for \nexternal people and activity authors to track what's going on in the \nsugar land.\n\nThanks,\nMarco\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
