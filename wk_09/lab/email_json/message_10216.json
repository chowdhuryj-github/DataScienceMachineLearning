I think for now you should not worry about this.\nOnce everything else is fixed you can change to an i686 kernel.\n\nSo here is your problem: You did an incomplete upgrade from Sarge to\nEtch. This is also obvious from the /etc/apt/sources.list which you\nposted in your other recent message. The most important thing is to\nupgrade your kernel to version 2.6.18. Somebody else had a similar issue\nvery recently; please see here for details:\n\nhttp://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop/2007/04/msg00089.html\n\nAlso note that the upgrade instructions are available in a number of\nlanguages (including Italian):\n\nhttp://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes\n\n(Make sure that you use one from the \"Intel x86\" row.)\n\nCompleting the upgrade procedure should get your system running again.\nReport back if anything should go wrong. \n\n-- \nRegards,            | http://users.icfo.es/Florian.Kulzer\n          Florian   |\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
