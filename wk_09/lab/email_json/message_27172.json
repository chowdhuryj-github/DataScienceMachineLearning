I know that if you place a blackslash in front of a\nreference, it returns an object, I believe. But what purpose does \\ have\nas a standalone construct? Or is this merely a typo?\n\nThanks,\n\n- sf\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
