You might try using the native driver (bcm43xx) instead of \nndiswrapper.  I believe you will need to extract the firmware from \nthe windows drivers.  There's a debian package called bcm43xx-fwcutter \nwhich will do this and put the files in /lib/firmware.\n(Instructions at http://www.debiantutorials.org/content/view/153/213/\nalso mention that it might be good to copy *.fw files from /lib/firmware\nto /lib/hotplug/firmware the author doesn't sound too sure about that.)\n\nSelim T.
