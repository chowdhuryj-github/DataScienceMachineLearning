Japan is the largest financial contributor, after the United States, for the rebuilding effort in Iraq, and is the third largest contributor in Afghanistan. Japanese defense forces have conducted refueling operations for the U.S. and coalition forces.\n\nAbe expressed thanks \"for the noble sacrifice the United States is making\" in Iraq. On Thursday, the Japanese leader went to Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects to U.S. war dead, and visited injured troops at Bethesda Naval Hospital.\n\n--!>\nVisit here to get enrolled for your Interior Design degree!      \n\n\n \n"}
