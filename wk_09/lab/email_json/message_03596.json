I'm \nsure those of you more knowledgeable than myself on this may have been \nable to resolve it better and quicker, but I'm still learning, as you \nwill soon see.\n\n\n\n    My machine came with a 120 gigabyte hard drive with a 30 gigabyte \nrescue partition containing the computer's recovery files, the other \npartition was taken up by Windows XP and various Thinkpad and Windows \napplications. \n\n    First, I tried to hook up the docking station and install Fedora \nusing the docking station's serial port to have Speakup talk for me.  \nSpeakup could not be found when I specified my Dectalk express as the \nsynthesizer, whether I specified a tty port by naming it specifically as \nsuggested by Janina or by having Speakup find it without specifying the \ntty port.  Consequently, in order to do my class assignments, I decided \nto have my instructor assist me in installing Fedora and together we  \ngot Gnome and Orca up and running.\n\n    When we tried to install Windows XP to set up the dual boot system, \nmy XP disk kept hanging at the hardware inspection portion of the \ninstallation.  Believe me, if I didn't need this laptop for school which \nrequires Windows and Linux, I would just keep a Linux system!!  \nLenovo tech support said on its web site to turn off the dual core \nprocessor support in the bios temporarily to allow Windows XP to install \nproperly.  I had a friend assist me and we turned off the dual core as \ndirected.  We still couldn't install XP, same problem, XP hanging at the \nhardware inspection process.\n\n    Just for grins, a fellow geek  friend who agreed to help me disabled \njust about everything in the bios, just to get XP running, no go with \nthat either, same problem.  She tried a Windows 2000 disk, just to see \nif she could see my Linux partition, and voila! Windows 2000 at least \nfigured out that Linux lived on my system and found the rescue \npartition.  She nuked those partitions for me, and we are starting from \nscratch!!  It seems that Linux and grub will see my Windows partition if \nI install Windows *before* Windows, but Windows XP gets cranky and won't \nsee my Linux partition if I install Linux first and then try to install \nWindows afterwards.  I realize that this sounds strange, so let me \nclarify.  Since there were only two partitions, I had to break the \nlarger one to install Linux and the one for the rescue partition wasn't \nbig enough for Fedora with all of the other applications and data in the \nrescue partition.  I didn't have access to something like partition \nmagic to rebuild the partitions, so we had to take this crazy route \ninstead.  This appears to be what happens at school with all of the dual \nboot systems where XP and Fedora 6 are involved, Windows seems to be \nhappy being installed first, then Linux and grub set up the dual boot \nproperly.  XP is now on my machine, and I am going to try again to \ninstall Linux.\n\n    Word to the wise, if you have a Thinkpad, the serial port appears to \nbe disabled by default in the bios.  We turned it on, and now I'm going \nto try\n again and see how it goes.  I'll keep you posted, unfortunately this \nthing isn't over yet.\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nBeth\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
