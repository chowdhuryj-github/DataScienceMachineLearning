Bush's choice for United\nStates Trade Representative (USTR), public health groups, like ours,\nwere concerned. Would Zoellick retain USTR's very new policy\n(announced by President Clinton on December 1, 1999, at the chaotic\nSeattle WTO ministerial) to consider the impact of trade policy and\nmedical patents on public health in developing countries?\n\nOr, as many expected, would he reverse policy and turn USTR back over\nto big pharma, and use the agency as a club to push for tougher rules\non patents and other intellectual property protections on medicines.\n\nZoellick surprised most people by announcing he would retain the\nnewer public-health friendly approach, and also persuaded George W.\nBush to keep intact Executive Order 13155, which President Clinton\nhad issued a year earlier (May 10, 2000), prohibiting federal\nemployees from seeking \"TRIPS Plus\" intellectual property protections\nin sub-Saharan Africa, when it interfered with access to treatments\nfor AIDS. But this was not all.\n\nBill Clinton had actually filed a WTO case against Brazil in January\n2001, days before he left office, over Brazil's efforts to use\ncompulsory licensing of patents to promote local production of AIDS\ndrugs. The case was very controversial, and the subject to criticism\nby activists, and the subject of Tina Rosenberg's influential New\nYork Times account of AIDS treatment in Brazil. Zoellick dropped the\ncase, after a (secret) deal with Brazil to consult with the U.S.\nbefore issuing such licenses.[1]\n\nIn November 2001, resisting enormous pressure from pharmaceutical\nCEOs, Zoellick signed on to the historic and much praised Doha\nDeclaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Among other things, this\ndeclaration declared:\n\n\n     We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not\nprevent members from taking measures to protect public health.\nAccordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement,\nwe affirm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and\nimplemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' right to protect\npublic health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for\nall.\n\n     In this connection, we reaffirm the right of WTO members to use,\nto the full, the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, which provide\nflexibility for this purpose.\n\n\nBad Bob\n\nBig pharma was shaken by Zoellick's first year as USTR. By early\n2002, things had changed. With regular meetings with Rove and Josh\nBolten, the pharma companies we able to closely dictate USTR policy\non a number of issues. By the end of 2002 USTR was receiving in some\ncases, hourly phone calls from the White House on negotiations over\nhow to implement the 2001 agreement. The results were not pretty. But\nfrom our perspective, it seemed as though the problem was the White\nHouse, and in particular Rove and Bolten, and not Zoellick.\n\nIn any event, Zoellick devised a new and highly effective way to push\nhigher IPR rules for developing countries -- they were put into\nbilateral agreements where the poor countries had almost now power to\nresist. Zoellick the technocrat, was worse than many ideologies, in\nterms of the impact. In this case, competence was not a good thing.\n\nZoellick then moved on, and the next two USTR chiefs were\nincreasingly worst than Zoellick on these issues.\n\nAll of this pushed poor countries in ways that make a mockery of the\npromises the U.S. made in 2001, at Doha.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe World Bank is supposed to be an advocate for the poor. Under\nWolfowitz, as under his predecessor, the Bank took in pharmaceutical\nindustry personnel to deal with sensitive procurement and\npharmaceutical policy issues, with almost no conflict of interest\nprotections. But Wolfowitz did not completely prevent the World Bank\nfrom doing the right thing. The record was mixed.\n\nZoellick comes at a time when the World Bank is being asked to\nrepresent the poor in debates over the role of intellectual property\nprotection and development. He doesn't like big pharma, but he has\nbeen a team player on many occasions, so it will be interesting to\nsee what he does with his new job, with his benefactor leaving office\nJanuary 2009.\n\nI hope we see Good Bob, and not Bad Bob.\n\n-----Footnote----\n[1] Brazil has never used this provision in its patent law. This year\nBrazil issued it's first compulsory license on an AIDS drug, under a\ndifferent part of their law.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\nJames Packard Love\nKnowledge Ecology International\nmailto:james.love@keionline.org\ntel. +1.202.332.2670 / U.S. mobile+1.202.361.3040, Geneva mobile\n+41.76.413.6584\n\n\"If everyone thinks the same: No one thinks.\" Bill Walton\"\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
