I must admit, that pill should be crowned the World's Eighth Wonder. An automatic increase in size and length is experienced, and the erection is ice-hard! It does a lot for confidence, and my lady loves it. Some side effects, like face flushing and headaches occur, but the pleasure overshadows it all.  I say Viagra... don't have sex without it.\nRonald Goss.\nYou can find it here \n\n\n"}
