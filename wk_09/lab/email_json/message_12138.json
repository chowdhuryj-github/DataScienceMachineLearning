Nothing in it\nprevents anyone engaging in commerce -- selling the software or\nanything related to it -- and many organisations and individuals have\nbeen doing exactly that for many years.\n\nFree software *is* commercial software; any software with a license\nthat restricted its sale is non-free by definition. Mistakenly using\n\"commercial\" as though it were the opposite of \"free\" spreads the\nfallacy.\n\n    \n\nThe distinction you may be looking for is \"under the GPL and under a\nnon-free license\".\n\n    \n\n-- \n \\        \"The errors of great men are venerable because they are more |\n  `\\  fruitful than the truths of little men.\"  -- Friedrich Nietzsche |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
