Right now you are free to choose to use\nany \"GPLv2 or later\" software under GPLv3. However any past use\nunder GPLv2 remains covered under GPLv2 only. You can't say *now*\nthat your copying *last year* was actually allowed under GPLv3.\n\n> Certainly the feeling is that MS will get caught by this date thingy as \n> a result of their deal with Novell.\n\nThe MS/Novell deal is actually grandfathered by this date.\nThat was the whole point of including that date. That was discussed\nwhen discussion drafts 3 and 4 came out.\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n              Arnoud blogt nu ook: http://blog.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
