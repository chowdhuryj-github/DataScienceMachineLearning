Use\nTRUE (which is a reserved word, so you can't create such a variable). \nDon't keep big workspaces full of stuff you don't know about, create a\nnew empty one in each session.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
