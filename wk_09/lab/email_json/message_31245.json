Col. Christopher Garver, a military spokesman. However, \"it would not surprise us if it were al-Qaida behind this, because we've seen this type of attack, this type of tactic, before.\"\n\nInsurgents also launched attacks across the country Sunday, with a suicide bomber in northern Iraq slamming a truck into local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which is headed by Massoud Barzani, leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.\n\nCars were charred and crushed by the blast in Makhmur, a town with a substantial Kurdish population just south of the autonomous Kurdish-controlled areas.\n\nAt least 50 people were killed and 115 were wounded, including the city's mayor, Abdul Rahman Delaf, who also is a prominent Kurdish writer, and the director of the KDP office, said Ziryan Othman, the health minister of the Kurdish regional government.\n\n\"Makhmur is an open, peaceful area, and al-Qaida is trying to destabilize it by causing fighting between Arabs and Kurds,\" said Qassim Amin, who son and daughter \u2014 who both work for the party \u2014 were injured. \n\n--!>     \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
