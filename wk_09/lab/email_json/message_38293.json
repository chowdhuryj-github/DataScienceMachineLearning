It's downright annoying, but I \nwish there were support for USB to serial adaptors, or something along those \nlines.  Either that, or preferably USB synths directly.\nThanks much,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"John Heim\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 7:42 AM\nSubject: Re: Debian install with Software Speech?\n\n\n>\n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Zachary Kline\" \n> To: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \n> \n> Sent: Sunday, May 27, 2007 12:52 AM\n> Subject: Debian install with Software Speech?\n>\n>\n>> Hiya,\n>>    I don't have access to a hardware speech synthesizer, and so was\n>> wondering what the options are for me to get a Debian install.
