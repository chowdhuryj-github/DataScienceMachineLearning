For students beyond the \nK-12 level, many retailers require that a student be enrolled in a degree-granting \nprogram, not merely taking a single class or seeking a \ncertificate.\n\nAcademic Superstore is the only seller I found that specifically mentions \nparents. But almost all such sellers provide discounts for students as \nyoung as kindergarten age. (And how many kindergartners have credit cards?) \nThe fact that parents can purchase for students is merely implied, in most \ncases. For example, \nCampus Tech lists among its \nqualifying documents a parent's ID for students K-12.\n\nMost sites selling academic software will accept home-schooled \nstudents as well.\n\nSome retailers offer discounts for other nonprofit organizations that \naren't strictly schools, such as public museums and libraries. These \noffers apply to most, but not all, discounted software. Some \ninstitutions, such as nonaccredited schools, hospitals, and \ntraining centers are specifically ruled out, depending on the software \npublisher. Furthermore, such institutional discounts usually only apply to \nvolume purchases, although \"volume\" means as few as five copies, \nin some cases.\n\nGenerally, stores that give these discounts are following the policies \nof the software publisher. Microsoft has made its \n eligibility requirements available on its Web site, as has \nAdobe.\n\n\n\nSeveral retailers offer education-discounted products\n\n\n\nMany software publishers provide dramatic discounts on their products for \neducational purposes. These include popular products such as \nMicrosoft Office as well as Adobe Acrobat and others.\n\nDiscounts on Windows itself are the hardest to come by. Windows XP \nProfessional (with Service Pack 2) and Vista Business Upgrade are \navailable at steep discounts (U.S. $27 and $62.50, respectively, from \nCCV Software, compared with $299 and \n$200 list.) But these prices \nare only granted to academic institutions, not to individuals, via Microsoft's \n Open License volume sales program.\n\nHowever, individuals with the right credentials can easily get educational \ndiscounts for Windows XP Professional Upgrade (with SP2) and Windows Vista \nHome Premium Upgrade. I've found the following academic discounts:\n\n\u2022 XP Pro SP2 Upgrade: $86 to $117 (compared to $192-239 street)\u2022 Vista Home Premium Upgrade: $65 to $90 (compared to \n$146-167 street)\n\nAt least one online reseller asks for no documentation at all. A pop-up message \nat VioSoftware.com \nsays, \"We do not require any proof that you will be using \nacademic software for academic use, nor does the manufacturer.\" Examples:\n\u2022 Office 2007 Pro Academic Full: \n$200 (compared to $500 list)\u2022 Office 2007 Standard Academic Full: \n$180 (compared to $400 list)\n\nAt roughly half off list price, VioSoftware is not the cheapest \nseller of academic software. But it still offers prices well below \nretail versions.\n\nThe software sold at these discounts is the same as any you would buy in a \nretail store. In most cases, you are limited to buying a single copy. \nAnd you must meet the documentation requirements.\nHow to document your claims\n\n\n\nUnlike ordinary retail purchases, buying software using an academic discount \nusually requires that you document your eligibility. Most sites require that you \nmail, e-mail, fax, or upload a .gif or .jpg image of the necessary \ndocuments. These typically include one or more of the following: student or \nfaculty ID (showing current semester or year), copy of current class schedule, \nregistration receipt, letter of enrollment or employment on letterhead, recent \nreport card, recent pay stub, or recent teaching contract. Many stores keep your \ndocumentation on file for a year (or until the dates on the documents expire) for \nfuture purchasing.\n\nQualifying documents for home schools and their students may be harder to come by. \nLetters from state departments of education, local school boards, or school \ndistricts recognizing the home school are likely to be accepted. In addition, it \nmay be useful to have receipts of purchases of a home-school curriculum from a \nnationally recognized provider of these products.\n\n\n\nWhere to shop for academic discounts\n\n\n\nUsing your favorite search engine, you should have no difficulty finding \nsoftware retailers that offer academic discounts. The ones I've found that \nhave the best prices and selection are, in alphabetical order:\n\n\nAcademic Superstore\nCampus Tech\nCreation Engine\nCCV Software\nJourneyEd\nSchool World\nVioSoftware\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

(Incidentally, if you send in a tip or trick that we \n\tprint, you'll receive a $25 gift certificate good for a book, CD, or DVD \n\tfrom Amazon!)\n\n\tThis week, I received additional info that amends my discussion on the items \"Keep phantom devices at bay\" and \n\t\"Restoring the HotPlug Manager,\" both of which appeared in the\n\tApr. 5 issue.\n\n\tSeveral readers (Rick Winterton was the first) suggested that another way to \n\tsafely remove a USB drive (and thus prevent it from appearing as a \n\tleft-behind ghost item in the Drives listing) is to right-click a \n\tremovable drive and select Eject from the context menu. Indeed, this can work, albeit not quite as reliably as the methods we \n\tpreviously discussed. Only some USB drives respond to an Eject \n\tcommand (I have a couple of Flash drives that won't disconnect that way), and \n\tmost other USB devices simply ignore the command. But, if the normal, \n\tofficially sanctioned methods aren't available to you, it may be worth \n\ttrying the Eject option. \n\n\tReader Larry Hoium also pointed me to a Knowledge Base article I'd never seen \n\tbefore. It's KB 315539, \n\twhich describes an obscure XP command:\nset devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1\n\nThat command allows the View/Hidden Devices menu in Device \nManager to list not only currently connected hidden devices, but also \nhidden devices that have been connected to the system at \nany time. Any ghost devices that are shown can then be \nuninstalled directly through Device Manager itself.\nFigure 1. KB 315539 \n\tshows you how to force Device Manager to display hidden devices that once \n\twere connected to the system, but that are not \n\tcurrently plugged in. In this example, note the three grayed-out drives, \n\twhich Device Manager normally would not show at all.\n\n\tThanks Rick, Larry, and all who wrote in! Keep those e-mails coming!\nHow to get 130+ browser shortcuts freeThose \n\tof you who've read Brian Livingston's excellent Windows Vista Secrets book \n\thave probably noted the references to keyboard shortcuts \u2014 those special \n\ttwo- or three-keystroke combinations that let you perform an action or access \n\ta software feature much faster than wading through the menus.\n\n\tFor example, \n\tyou almost surely already know that Alt+Tab lets you switch among open windows faster than \n\tby accessing the same windows via the Taskbar. But there are probably dozens \n\tor even hundreds of other time-saving shortcuts that you may not know about!\n\n\tBrian's Vista book covers everything in Vista, including IE 7, and he lists \n\tIE 7 keyboard shortcuts on pages 487-489. If you're using Vista, that's the \n\tplace to go for the best information.\n\n\tIf you're not running Vista, but are using IE 7, then you should take a \n\tlook at TechRepublic's PDF download\n\t60  \tkeyboard shortcuts to move faster in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7. Note that free \n\tregistration is required.\n\n\tIf you're using Firefox, then\n\t70+  \tkeyboard shortcuts to move faster in Mozilla Firefox will be of interest \n\tto you. \n\tIt's also available for download after free registration.\nPatch cord saves USB headachesIn \n\tthis and other recent issues, I've discussed some of the software-based \n\tproblems that can befall USB devices.\n\tBut it's worth mentioning another, purely physical danger that can totally cripple a \n\tUSB device: wear and tear on the USB plugs and sockets themselves.\n\n\tI've seen this mostly in Flash drives: Unless they're plugged in to and \n\tpulled out of USB sockets with great care, repeated off-angle insertions and \n\tremovals can stress the plugs and sockets, causing them to flex. In time, \n\tthe internal electrical connections can break, leaving you with a dead \n\tsocket. Unless you have the skill and inclination to open the case and do some \n\tvery delicate soldering, the \n\tsocket is gone for good.\n\n\tAn inexpensive \"patch cord\" can help. A patch cord is a kind \n\tof USB extension cord: a length of cable with a USB plug on one end and a \n\tsocket on the other. Because the cord is lightweight and flexible, it's much \n\teasier to align to the permanently mounted plugs and sockets on your PC and \n\tUSB devices. Sometimes, you can even leave the patch cord connected to your \n\tPC, so all the wear and tear happens on the inexpensive patch cord's socket, \n\trather than the harder-to-replace PC's socket.\n\n\tAlmost all electronics retailers sell \n\tUSB patch cords, and they can cost as \n\tlittle as $2 for the shorter lengths. If you frequently plug in and unplug \n\tyour USB devices, a patch cord can be cheap insurance!\nAnother way to tune your Internet \n\tconnectionAn item on semi-automated \n\tInternet connection tuning in the\n\tMar. 15 \n\tissue generated a great reader suggestion on a nearly fully automated \n\tmethod. That tip appeared in the  \tApr.  \t5 issue.\n\n\tYet another good suggestion comes from reader Vuong Phung. He \n\trecommends an incredibly detailed manual method described in the\n\tNavas  \tCable Modem/DSL Tuning Guide. The benefit of the manual method is that \n\tyou have complete control over every variable and can fine-tune your \n\tconnection parameters to whatever degree you wish. It's a more laborious \n\tway to tune, but one that gives you the ultimate in flexibility and adaptability.\n\n\tSo now, with a full spectrum of free connection-tuning options available \u2014\n\tmanual,\n\tsemi-automated, \n\tand fully automated \n\t\u2014 we all should be able to find a solution that delivers the best-possible \n\tperformance from our Internet connections.\n\n\tThanks, Vuong!\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\nFred Langa is editor of the \n      Windows Secrets Newsletter.
