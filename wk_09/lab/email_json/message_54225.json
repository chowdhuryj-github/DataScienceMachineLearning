You could also use \"use warnings\" instead of -w,\nand adding \"use strict\" will prevent some common mistakes.\n\n  use strict;\n  use warnings;\n\n> use iterdir;\n\nWhat's this? Module names in all lower case are reserved for pragmas.\nIn the privacy of your own home directory, of course, you can name\nthings whatever you want.
