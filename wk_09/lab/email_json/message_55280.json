As far as I'm concerned, the makers of\naccess tech can charge any amount they'd like.  If it's too\nexpensive, people will either not use it or more likely\ndevelope their own solutions which doesn't hurt opensource\nin the slightest.\n\nNot trying to justify closed source software at all as the\nkey advantage of open source for me anyway isn't its free\nof charge nature but rather for the ability to modify it to\nsuit my needs.\n\nFor those who think prices are inflated by the greedy\ncorporation, if that were the case and so much profit was\nbeing made in the area, why haven't other firms entered the\nmarket, driving prices down as a result?\n\nS\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
