I messed with cygwin a while\nback and I didn't mind the overall environment all that much but I\nhated the installer! I found the pick list to be completely\ninaccessible.  I couldn't track the selection status of any of the\nlist items within each package category.  I sure didn't want to\ninstall every single package so when I had such a hard time picking\npackages, I finally gave up on it.  I also wrote to the developers on\nthe support list about the installer and the response was the program\nwas so complex and intrenched that it would be nearly impossible to\nchange it.  So I am no longer interested in doing anything with\ncygwin.\n\nMy only other experience with the windows API was with Visual Basic\nand the internal object browser.  I found quite a bit of information\nin the help system within the browser.  That would probably next to\nimpossible to pull that info without the Microsoft development\nenvironments such as in Visual Studio.  Perhaps the tutorials Greg\nmentions is a big help.\n-- \nHolmesGrown Solutions\nThe best solutions for the best price!\nhttp://holmesgrown.ld.net/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
