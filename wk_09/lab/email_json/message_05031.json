I am \ncurrently running 2.6.19 as downloaded from speakupmodified.org and it works \nfine but like to keep my system as updated as possible.  Do you usually make \nannouncements when a new rpm of the fedora kernels are released and if not \nwhat is the easiest way to check?  What is this read all mode?\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Kirk Reiser\" \nTo: \nSent: Friday, April 13, 2007 4:14 PM\nSubject: DECTalk Express driver\n\n\n> Hello folks:  For those of you waiting on a working DECTalk Express\n> driver for 2.6.20 and above I checked in a redesigned driver this\n> afternoon.
