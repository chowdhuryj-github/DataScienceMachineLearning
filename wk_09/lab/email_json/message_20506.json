Now\nshipping with the Smith-Waterman\nsequence-matching\nsearch (more\nalgorithms are under development) for precise\nsequence searches  at up to 200 times the\nspeed of a\nstandard laptop!\n                \n\n                That speed reduces an analysis time of 14\nhours on a\ndesktop machine to just 7 minutes, and approaches\nthe performance of\na high-end cluster - at a tiny fraction of\nthe cost,\non your own desk, and fully portable!\n                \n\n                Compared with our recently announced Cell,\nwhich accesses inbuilt features of modern\nmicroprocessors, the Cube is separate\nmassively parallel hardware designed for\ncustomers who need even faster computer power\nor have existing large investments in older\ncomputer hardware or clusters.\n                \n\nUntil the end of May 2007, the Cube comes\nbundled with CLC Combined Workbench - the\nbioinformatics software industry leader in\nfeatures and ease of use - for no extra\ncharge!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    What is the Bioinformatics Cube?\n                    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                    The next big thing in bioinformatics is small\n                    \n\n\n\nThe Bioinformatics Cube is a massively parallel\nhardware accelerator for bioinformatics analyses,\nbased on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)\ntechnology and connected to your computer by a fast\nUSB 2.0 cable.\n\n\nFPGA technology is not only at the heart of the\nmassively parallel processing that gives the Cube\nits astounding speed, but enables easy updating and\naddition of algorithms via software, downloaded via\nthe internet.\n\n\nUSB connection provides fast and nearly universal\nconnectability, and coupled with the small size and\nweight of the Cube (1.3 kg), complete portability.\n\n\nNote: Your institution will need its own\nlocal database for Cube searches. The Cube cannot\nsearch over the internet, as such searches are\nperformed remotely by the host servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Why Smith-Waterman?\n                    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                    Perfect precision for better science\n                    \n\n\n                    BLAST is the most popular search algorithm,\nreturning reasonable matches quickly.\nBut BLAST achieves its speed by sacrificing\nprecision. Do you know how many search results you\nare missing when using BLAST? Up to 50% of the hits\nare not found using BLAST.\n                    \n\nIf you want 100% of the answers, the Smith-Waterman\nalgorithm is the answer. But its precision comes at\na price, and for most people, it is just too slow to\nbe useful in their daily research.\n\n\nNow with The Cube, you don't need compromises. The\nCube delivers Smith-Waterman results at speeds up to\n100 times that of a 3 GHz PC, providing results at\nspeeds\napproaching that of BLAST. All you require is a\ndesktop computer with a\nUSB 2.0 port - and a 12 cm square of desk space to\nsit it on.\n\n\nRead CLC's White Paper on The Cube...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    What Do I Get?\n                    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                    More reasons to buy...\n                    \n\n\n                    Until the end of May 2007, each Cube comes\nbundled with one licence of the CLC Combined\nWorkbench, which sells on its own for\nthousands of dollars! (The Combined\nWorkbench is CLC bio's flagship product,\nproviding a\nwide range of basic and leading-edge Gene and\nProtein analyses.)\n                    \n\nThe initial release of The Cube includes just one\nalgorithm, the Smith-Waterman. However each\npurchase\nentitles you to one year of additional algorithms\nwithout further charge. CLC bio is actively\ndeveloping several new algorithms, and as\neach new\nalgorithm\n(automatically bundled into future releases\nof The\nCube) will attract an extra price of more than\n$1,000, buying now makes The Cube an even more\nattractive proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Ease of Use\n                    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                    As simple as it is fast\n                    \n\n\n                    As the Bioinformatics Cube is seamlessly\nintegrated\nwith CLC bio's bioinformatics software solutions,\nyou will have an easy access to using the cube,\nbased on a graphical user interface.\n                    \n\n                    From within the workbenches you can simply\nselect to\nperform the given analysis locally on your\ncomputer\nwith the CPU power available - or select the\nBioinformatics Cube and have your computing speed\nincrease significantly.\n                    \n\nAnd don't forget that  until end of May 2007,\nwhen you buy a Bioinformatics Cube, you'll\nautomatically get a full license for CLC\nCombined Workbench.\n\n\n                    Or if you prefer, you can also use a\ncommand line interface of an internal web\ninterface.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Who is The Cube for?\n                    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                    Power for The People\n                    \n\n\n                    The low cost and small size of The Cube and its\nsimple USB 2.0 connection and integration\nwith CLC\nbio's graphical software makes it ideal for\nindividual researchers and labs with access\nto local\ndatabases and who need precise, reliable\nsearches in\nquick timeframes.\n                    \n\nThe power of The Cube also makes it ideal for\ncentral bioinformatics facilities and\nservices, with\npower within shouting distance of Computer\nClusters\nat a fraction of the cost.\n\n\nMore on price/performance...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing The Cube,\ncontact Genesearch by email or\nphone (1800 074 278) to discuss your needs and pricing.\n\n\nGenesearch is the Australian distributor for CLC bio\nbioinformatics software and hardware and for Gene\nCodes Sequencher software for DNA sequence\nanalysis\n\n\nGenesearch also distributes New England Biolabs\nenzymes and products for molecular biology, Cell\nSignaling Technology antibodies for signal\ntransduction research and Finnzymes PCR and\nmolecular biology products.\n\n\n\n\n            Sincerely,\n            \n\n\n    \n            Genesearch\n            \n\n\n            Email:\n            \nenews@genesearch.com.au\n\n\n\n            Phone:\n            1800 074 278\n            \n\n            Fax:\n            07 5594 0562\n            \n\n            Web:\n            \nhttp://www.genesearch.com.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward email\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca, by enews@genesearch.com.au\nUpdate Profile/Email Address | Instant removal with SafeUnsubscribe\u2122 | Privacy Policy.\n\nEmail Marketing by\n\n\nGenesearch Pty Ltd | 14 Technology Dr | Arundel | Qld | 4214 | Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
