The options can then be \npermanently saved in the config file for powersave.\n\nFor one laptop, I also needed the patch from:\n\n\thttp://forge.novell.com/pipermail/powersave-commit/2007-January/001086.html\n\nto permit some extra options for suspend.\n\nHope that helps.\n\ncheers\nStuart\n\n\n-- \nStuart Prescott                 www.nanoNANOnano.net\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
