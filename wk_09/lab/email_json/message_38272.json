There are \nstill a lot of howtos out on the web for this but briefly, what you need to \ndo is attach a null modem cable to the serial port on the target machine, \nconnect the other end to a machine that already has speech and fire up a \nterminal emulator program on  that machine.  At the boot prompt, type 'linux \nconsole=ttyS0,9600n8'. There are lots of variations on what you'd type at \nthe boot prompt so consult the howtows.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
