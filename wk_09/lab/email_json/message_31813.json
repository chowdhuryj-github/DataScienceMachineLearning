And, no fan of the late Dr. Leary, Mr. Feldmar\ntook his last hit of acid in 1974.\n\nThirty-two years, however, turned out to be but an instant in the long,\nunrelenting U.S. war on drugs. Last summer, in an incident that has just\ncome to light, Mr. Feldmar, now 66, was banned from entering the United\nStates because of his long-ago use of LSD.\n\nBecause Mr. Feldmar had never been charged with possession of the once\npopular illegal drug, privacy advocates are even more alarmed by the way\nU.S. border guards at the busy Peace Arch crossing near Vancouver found\nout about it.\n\nThe guards simply looked up Mr. Feldmar on the Internet and discovered his\nown article about using LSD, written for the scholarly, peer-reviewed\njournal Janus Head.\n\nEugene Oscapella, an Ottawa lawyer involved in privacy issues for 20\nyears, said the incident sends a frightening message to Internet users,\nparticularly those who bare their souls online. \"Don't ever put anything\nabout any illegal activity on the Internet,\" Mr. Oscapella warned\nyesterday. \"It leaves a digital footprint for all to see, and it's there\nforever. \"\n\n\"We've gone beyond Orwellian measures. The state can now do things with a\nflick of the switch that used to be incredibly labour intensive.\"\n\nGiven the United States' \"almost fanatical position on drugs,\" Mr.\nOscapella said, even a teenager who simply writes in a blog about smoking\nmarijuana is now vulnerable to online scrutiny by U.S. border guards.\n\n\"It's an awful situation. Maybe you're somewhere on YouTube or Facebook.\nThey just have to Google your name. I don't think kids understand the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"It's not like you can just burn your notebooks any more,\" he said.   \n\"This is forever, folks.\"\n\nAs for Mr. Feldmar, a prominent Vancouver psychotherapist with a long list\nof published articles and academic achievements, he still has trouble\ncomprehending what happened on his bad trip trying to cross into the\nUnited States.\n\n\"Over 30 years ago, I did some acid. So what? I just couldn't believe they\nwould not let me in,\" he said over the phone, during a break in his busy\npractice.\n\n\"I've been going to the States for years, and I'd never been stopped\nbefore. My kids used to call me the Border Jedi. It was surreal.\"\n\nHe said he doesn't know why border guards chose this time to question him\nfurther, prompting their Internet search. \"Perhaps they didn't believe my\nstory that I was going to Seattle to pick up a friend at the airport. Who\nknows?\"\n\nMr. Feldmar was held at the border for five hours, before being allowed to\nreturn to Canada after signing an admission that he had once violated the\nU.S. Controlled Substance Act.\n\nHe said he signed out of fear that he might be kept in custody even longer\nif he refused.\n\nWillie Hicks, public affairs officer for the border crossing, said\nyesterday that Mr. Feldmar admitted violating U.S. drug laws in a sworn\nstatement.\n\n\"I don't make the laws. That's the policy, and we enforce the laws at the\nborder. It is up to the discretion of our officers who gets to go\nacross.\"\n\nMr. Feldmar is now banned permanently from entering the United States,\nunless he applies for and receives a waiver.\n\nAfter months of consideration, Mr. Feldmar said he has decided not to\napply for a waiver, despite the hardship of not being able to visit his\ntwo adult children, who live in Los Angeles and Denver.\n\n\"It's too degrading,\" he said. \"I would probably have to lie [about using\nLSD] and say I was rehabilitated. But rehabilitated from what?\n\n \"I feel I was punished because I happened to write about using LSD.\nOtherwise, how would they have known?\"\n\nAt one point in his 2001 article, Mr. Feldmar describes an acid trip with\nrenowned and controversial psychotherapist R. D. Laing.\n\n\"I looked into Ronnie's eyes and saw myself reflected there,\" he wrote. \"I\nfelt unworthy and flooded with shame. Then I felt accepted . . .\"\n\n\"The window was open and rainy, moist, cool air streamed in. Birds sang. I\nsipped tea from a tea-bowl that my wife had made. I noticed my reflection\non the steaming tea.\"\n\nAsked why he stopped taking LSD in 1974, Mr. Feldmar replied: \"Many people\nwho experimented with drugs at that time moved on. You learn from them,\nand then you graduate.\"\n\n==\n\nObviously, privacy isn't what it used to be.  And with the combined forces\nof the Internet and the Patriot Act, it never will be again.\n\nThe greater security achieved through these measures is certainly welcome.\n Though Mr. Feldmar appears to pose no threat to U.S. security, there's no\ndoubt that the Internet does help law officials catch criminals.\n\nBut we pay a price for this security, and it's not just financial.   \nAt the extreme, these measures curtail our liberty, and that's a right\nI've long valued.\n\nIn fact, back in my college days, I dabbled in philosophy for a while\nbefore drifting into the path that eventually resulted in an English\ndegree.  My favorite philosopher was John Stuart Mill, and my favorite\nbook of his was \"On Liberty,\" followed closely by \"Utilitarianism. \"  Both\nbooks are still on my bookshelf today and this past weekend I reread parts\nof \"On Liberty\" for the first time since then.\n\nThe thesis of the book, which I've carried in my head these past few\ndecades, is that each individual has the right to act as he wants, as long\nas these actions do not harm others.  Of course, the concept of \"harm\" can\nbe stretched far beyond bodily injury:  Lawyers today are expert at\nclaiming all sorts of damages, including psychological and emotional.\n\nBut the main point is clear, and extends to the point that it's perfectly\nacceptable to harm yourself, as long as you don't harm others in the\nprocess.\n\nIn any event, it's hard to imagine 66-year-old Mr. Feldman -- given the\nfacts known -- being a danger to either other individuals or society as a\nwhole.  But because he admitted to breaking the law 34 years ago, he's now\nbanned from entering the U.S.\n\n==\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?\n\nPaul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks for\npromising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of\nthe BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).

On the one hand, liberties are being curtailed.  On\nthe other hand, outlets for individual expression multiply.  Both YouTube\nand MySpace, for example, encourage public expression of individual\ndetails.  And even if we do no \"self-publicizing,\" the digitals records of\nour lives proliferate.\n\nAmazon's record of books I've bought is no doubt quite revealing, as are\nthe records held by my credit card company.  My favorite airline knows\nwhere I've flown and when.  The federal government knows when I leave the\ncountry and when I return.  And even the organization that administers my\nE-Z Pass, which makes it possible to zoom through toll gates from Maine\nthrough Virginia without stopping, knows so much about me that they might\nretroactively start sending out speeding tickets, based on the time it\ntook me to travel from one toll plaza to the next.\n\nAt bottom, the increasing availability of personal data, combined with the\ngovernment's increasing appetite to collect and use that data, make our\nlives less private in the long run.\n\nAnd you know what?  That makes us more like China!\n\nI say this because my daughter in Beijing recently wrote a piece about\ncultural differences between the U.S. and China, and one segment dealt\nwith privacy.  Here's an excerpt:\n\n\"Being in a crowd of Chinese people often feels like being a gumball near\nthe bottom of the machine as someone turns the lever. \"Personal Space\" is\nnot a concept here. If you're not physically present in the space, someone\nelse can be there. Even if you're in the space an atom over.  They drive\nthe same way. As long as the taxi isn't actually in the same place as the\nbus, it's all good. There is no buffer zone around the bus where the taxi\nshouldn't be. Same goes for pedestrians, bicycles and horse-drawn carts.\nAn inch, a centimeter, a hair's breadth away - all acceptable. Which can\nbe just a little bit terrifying for passengers and pedestrians used to a\nlittle breathing room.\"\n\n\"Same holds true in conversation. I can't tell you how many times someone\nabout a foot shorter than me has stood an inch away from my collarbone to\ntell me something. And then stayed there, for an entire conversation.\nYou'd think it would hurt their necks.  All of these close encounters are\nactually tied to one fundamental difference between Chinese and American\nculture. The idea of privacy as we know it just doesn't exist here. We\nactually had a Chinese lesson on the subject in which the word privacy was\nwritten in English throughout the lesson to emphasize its\nnon-translateableness. There just isn't an equivalent concept, so there's\nno word for it.\"\n\n==\n\nAnd that brings me to the stock of the day.  It's a Chinese company that\nmakes and installs security cameras and recording devices.   \nSimilar devices are in use all over the world, particularly in big cities;\nLondon has tens of thousands installed; they're on all major street\ncorners.  New York has about 10,000.  And China has far, far fewer,\nmeaning there's a much larger domestic market opportunity . . . especially\nbecause the Chinese have no concept of privacy!\n\nThis stock was first recommended by Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China &\nEmerging Markets Report, back in February, and here's what he wrote.\n\n\"China Security (CSCT) is a player in the fast-developing market for the\ncameras, recorders and other monitoring devices that people in the West\ntake for granted. China hasn't needed this equipment, but rapid\nindustrialization and economic development is changing that.\"\n\n\"Between organic demand growth and huge legislative mandates, the market\nfor S & S equipment has been expanding at a 45% rate. The company's\nproducts are fairly standard, but two things, 1) the Beijing Olympics and\n2) the national surveillance initiative as part of China's Safe Cities\nProject, will create an enormous state-mandated demand.\"\n\n\"CSST seems well-positioned to get its fair share. The company is active\nin acquiring firms with complementary products and distribution networks.\n. . Cabot's take: The stock has been in a strong uptrend since August,\nrising from 4 to 16 in mid-January. It has now pulled back to its 50-day\nmoving average at 12 and shows signs of getting moving again. Opinion:\nPositive.\"\n\nIn retrospect, that was a great buy point.  Since then the stock has\nclimbed as high as 18!  But now it's fallen back down below 14, and to me,\nthe stock seems to be nearing another attractive buy point, technically.\n\nBut a few things have changed since February on the fundamental side.\n\nFirst, on April 9, the company announced that it had secured thirty-nine\nnew contract wins that are expected to result in approximately $32 million\nin revenues in the second quarter.  The new contracts include citywide\nsecurity and surveillance contracts, as well as installations in cyber\ncafes, factories, railway stations and corporate locations.\n\nThe next day, the stock peaked at $18.10.  (Note for beginners: stocks\npeak when perception is highest, and frequently, that's after good news is\nannounced.)\n\nThen, on May 11, the company announced the completion of one acquisition\nand the expected completion of two additional acquisitions by the end of\nthe second quarter.\n\nThe first was HighEasy Electronic Technology.  For just $10.4 million,\nChina Security and Surveillance gets the firm's leading data compression\ntechnology, useful in sending large amounts of video data across\ntelecommunications networks.\n\nThe second is Changzhou Mingking Electronics.  For $26 million, China\nSecurity & Surveillance gets China's top manufacturer of high-speed dome\ncameras, which can view 360 degrees, pan, zoom and tilt, all at high\nspeed.\n\nAnd the third is Hangzhou Tsingvision Intelligence System Company.   \nFor $13 million, China Security gets China's leading developer and\nsolution provider of intelligence management platforms for network video.\n\nAll acquisitions, which will be accomplished with both cash and stock, are\nexpected to be beneficial in the long run, but in the short run, they will\ncost money and require time and money to integrate.\n\nSo that's where the stock's correction began.  And then, two weeks later,\ncame the news that the company would issue $50 million in guaranteed\nsenior unsecured convertible notes to Citadel Equity Fund.  Short-term,\nthat's more bad news.  But they had to pay for those acquisitions\nsomehow!\n\nFinally, two nights ago, the first quarter earnings report was released. \nRevenues were $38.5 million, up 164% from the year before, while earnings\nwere $0.20 per share, up 67% from the year before.   \nThose numbers are good, but they represent slowing growth.  One factor -\nthe company has been cutting some prices in a competitive environment.\n\nAs a result of all this \"bad news,\" the stock has corrected from 18 to\nunder 14, for a decline of over 25%.  If you like the long-term prospects\n(I do), it seems fairly attractive down here.\n\nOne caveat:  The average daily trading volume for CSCT is 208,000 shares. \nThat's thin, so the stock's progress, both up and down, is not as orderly\nas most.  The stock does not qualify for listing on the Nasdaq market yet;\nit's traded on the Bulletin Board.  But if you're nimble, I believe this\nstock presents some great opportunities for profit.\n\n==\n\nEditor's Note\n\nCabot China & Emerging Markets Report is your best source of investing\nadvice for stocks of China, Brazil, India and Russia.
