I have conducted a thorough analysis and come up\nwith a pile of negative results (I'm the King, baby).  I found\nasypow, which applies to likelihood ratio tests.  However, we\ngenerally have the power to do Wald tests, I just need to prove it so\nthat we can publish it ;)\n\nIf this is a \"dumb\" question (i.e., there's something inherent in\ndoing the test that implies the power to do detect an effect, or\npublished results for certain sample sizes), please let me know, it\nwill save me a lot of time.\n\nJoel\nKing of Negative Results\n-- \nJoel J.
