For ac, I used the standard acf formula:\nacf(k) = sum(X(t)-Xbar)(X(t-k)-Xbar))/sum(X(t)-Xbar)^2. But for pac, I could\nnot figure out how to calculate it by hand. I understand that in both R and\nEVIEWS, it is done using the Durbin-Levinson algorithm by the computer.\nHowever, I don't understand exactly how the algorithm works just by looking\nat the algorithm. Does anyone know if there is a short cut to calculate pac\nby hand (or in a spreadsheet), or is it too complex of a procedure that a\ncomputer is absolutely necessary? It seems that there should be a natural\nrelationship between ac and pac so that once ac is calculated, pac can be\neasily calculated based on ac.\nThanks,\n\n-- \nTom\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
