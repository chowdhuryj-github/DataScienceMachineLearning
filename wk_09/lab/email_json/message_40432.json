I learned on\n2nd edition Llama and Camel, so I dug up my old copies.  Learning Perl\n2nd Edition says on page 92\n\n    The subname is th name of the subroutine, which is any name like\n    the names we've has for scalar variables, arrays, and hashes.  Once\n    again, these come from a different namespace, so you can have a\n    scalar variable $fred, an array @fred, a hash %fred, and now a\n    subroutine fred*.\n\n    * Technically, the subroutine's name is &fred, but you seldom need\nto call it that.\n\nAlso, on page 93 it says\n\n    Invoking a User Function\n    You invoke a subroutine from within any expression by following\nthe subroutine\n    name with parentheses, as in:\n\n        say_hello();          # a simple expression\n        $a = 3 + say_hello(); # part of a larger expression\n        for ($x = start_value(); $x < end_value(); $x += increment()) {\n            ...\n        }                     # invoke three subroutines to define values\n\nI checked Programming Perl (2nd Edition), just in case you meant the\nCamel instead of the Llama, and it appears* to talk about subroutines\nin the same was as perlsub currently does with no specific\nrecommendations about whether to use & or not (it just explains all of\nthe options and their side effects).\n\nThe Llama (2nd edition) was published in 1997.  That was ten years\nago.  You can see why I want to know where these people who are new to\nPerl are being told to use & as part of the subroutine name.  I assume\nthere are some old tutorials out there (things live forever on the\nInternet) and they are reading bad, old code at work.\n\n* there may be a recommendation somewhere, but I couldn't find one in\nmy cursory glance through it.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
