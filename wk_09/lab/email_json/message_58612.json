The real problem are hardcoded references\nto \"GPL\" when they should have been references to GPL-2.\n\nFor programs which are under \"GPL v2 or later\" or \"GPL v3 or later\"\n(most of them, if I'm not mistaken), the symlink is useful, so it\nshould be kept.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
