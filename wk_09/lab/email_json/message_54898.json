So, when file1 is finished, it automatically starts  \ngetting file2.\nI'm sure there's a setting somewhere in the config files that will  \ntell it to get them in sequence or simultaneously, but I've never  \nfiddled with that, and my files always come down one after the other.\n\nI.E. you don't have to wait for file1 to be finished before asking for  \nfile2, but it will wait until file1 is finished before getting file2  \nanyway.\nThis works for standard ftp as well.\n(never used lftp, so can't comment)\n\nThe reason this works is because when you type a new command, it  \nsimply goes into the buffer, and the ftp program processes the input  \nbuffer *after* it's finished what it's doing at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
