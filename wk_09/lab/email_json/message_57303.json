As\nfar as I can see (which might be not too far), this will indeed lead\nto more robust estimates. But is this true?\n\nAnother question concerns the practical side of things. How can I do\nthis in mclust? I've read through the manual but this leaves me\nuncertain about the exact implementation (and earlier posts about this\nproblem seem not to have been answered by the mailing list).\n\nIf specifying a prior for the covariance matrix is possible (and\nsensible) in mclust, could someone provide an example of how to\nspecify a prior on the covariance matrix?\n\nThank you,\nDieter\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
