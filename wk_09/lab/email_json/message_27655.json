The TRUSTDOMCACHE is not so\nmuch a limited cache entry like the rest of wcache but it\nmore of an accumulation of information collected from multiple\nenumeration requests.  Another tdb would simply clutter the\nfile system.\n\nAlso note that at least in winbindd_ads.c, the trusted_domains()\nfunction no longer caches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGRJaJIR7qMdg1EfYRAubnAJ4tglSWg3mjRfBjkFYOAjbykXFbzACgn7lI\nyphPW20q74/ZzQPrKJYkBi4=\n=zHCH\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
