Say, for example \ni had PUMFID position1 and Y_Q10A position 33 and i do not want to include \nall the variables in between. Is there a way to do this in R when you are \nextracting variables from a large .txt file with many, many variables?\n\nThanks,\n\nNat\n\n__________________\n\n\nYes but I believe it will vary depending on what\npackage you're using.  I don't deal with weigthed data\nso I'm not a good source\n\nHave a look at help for something like lm in the stats\n  package (part of the base installation) for an\nexample.\n \n?lm \n\nweight is the fourth argument down.\n\nHowever for more information try\nhttp://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/search.html and type in\nweight.\n\nAs Brian Ripley says in a reply to a question about\nweights:\n \"Almost all methods I know of do: logistic\nregression, neural nets, classification trees, PPR\n.... \"\n\n\n--- Natalie O'Toole  wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> \n> Thank-you for the response!!
