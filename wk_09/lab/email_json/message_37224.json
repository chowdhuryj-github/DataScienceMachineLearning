No need to compile your kernel without preemption of the\nbig kernel lock, etc.\nIt works for me, at any rate.  YMMV.\n\nPS. I think there are issues with speechd-up, but I can't quite put my\nfinger on them.  speechd-up seems to be overly greedy when reading and\nspeaking text from /dev/softsynth.\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
