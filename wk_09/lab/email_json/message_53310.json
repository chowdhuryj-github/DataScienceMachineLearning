In a few areas I used the \nscreen attributes function to read the screen colors.  Setting the \ntimezone wasn't easy, and I'm probably set to some timezone in Uganda. \n  I'm surprized tzconfig isn't in Slackware, or if it is, it's \nnot in the path.  It worked in Debian.   I'm starting to sound \nlike a Windows user with a win-modem.  I'd better shut up.  Gods, it \nfeels good to be back at the prompt.\n\n        Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
