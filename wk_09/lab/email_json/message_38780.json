The DBI client is a bit more complicated, yes?\n\n>\n> > > > The array was being rewritten.\n> > > Then you didn't delcare your variables in the correct scope.\n> > understandable misperception on your part, as above\n>\n> Nope.

I declared my array in a different scope in\nthe sample. Neither is \"wrong\", they are different.\n\n> > > > I had to use an array copy\n>\n> > > >   push @tRespsA, [ @r1 ];   ## copy contents to an anonymous array,\n> > > > push array ref\n>\n> > > Do you understand *why* that was necessary?

I am not trying to insulting you Paul, why resort to that?\nYou have no idea how many programs I've written, well. I'd say its bad form\nto assume the worst or lowest in people.\n\n>\n> >   aha, a force to be reckoned with.

Its notoriously difficult to convey\ncontext and nuance in a few lines of ascii text. Please refer to your RTFM\nand then essentially yelling at me for a modest sample program.\n\nI am not backing down from your brow-beating. I posted a small working\nsample program then found out more about the context I was dealing with and\nattempted to discuss it in an unassuming manner. For this I get these\nresponses. phooey!\n\nI'll be posting again from time to time, and probably going to OSCon.\nHappy\nto talk with you anytime. May not respond every time though. I think I am\nsensing a pattern here...\n\nbest regards\n  -Brian\n\n\n\n\n--\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org For additional\ncommands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org http://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\nThis e-mail is from the PA Group.
