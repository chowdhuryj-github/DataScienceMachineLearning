While I can\nsee the use of this function, it doesn't mesh well with my personal style of\nusing R (e.g., using the up arrow, adding an rparen, jumping to the\nbeginning of the line, and then wrapping a summary, for instance).\n\nSome 10 minutes of google searching has failed to come up with a solution\nfor turning this feature off--any suggestions from the list?\n\nCordially,\nAdam Kramer\nUniversity of Oregon\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
