I just got Samba4 compiled on my FreeBSD 6.2 box.  Although, \nconfigure never found any of my acl headers despite them being in /lib \nand /usr/lib.  Can I still use posix:eadb parameter until I can figure \nout what happened?  Also, one dumb question, if I may . . . . how do I \ndefine a share in Samba4 TP 6?  Inside of smb.conf or another way?  I \ntake it that I'll need to define a SYSVOL and NETLOGON share.\n\nThanks\n\ntridge@samba.org wrote:\n> Andrew,\n> \n>  > Perhaps tridge can detail the steps he required to have GPOs working\n>  > (before I got MMC going). \n> \n> yeehaa!
