Even worse, the default given in the man page of smb.conf is \nwrong:\n\nwinbind separator = '\\'\n\nThis will actually set the separator to a single quote ('). Similarly,\n\nwinbind separator = \"\\\"\n\nwill set it to a double quote (\"). People may also think that\n\nwinbind separator = \\\\\n\nworks. And yes, the separator will be \\ indeed, but the next line in the \nconfig file will have no effect, because it's taken as continuation of the \nwinbind separator line.\n\nOne way that works is\n\nwinbind separator = \\garbage\n\nbut imho this is not really obvious.\n\nThus, this should either either be fixed so that '\\' and \"\\\" both work as \nexpected, or the problem should be described in the man page!\n\nComments, please?\n\nCheers, Johann\n\n"}
