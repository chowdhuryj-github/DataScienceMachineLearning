I installed debian testing (actual) on it and it works fine.\nBut one problem is, the key to change backlight-brightness don't work.\nIf the notebook is powered from grid, then the light is full brightness,\nand if it's powered from accu, the light is very weak (I think the\nminimum).\n\nI have the nvidia driver from aptitude and all works find (also opengl).\nAlso the newest nvidia-driver from their homepage don't work the\nbacklight. I tried also \"nvclock -S xx\". But, the output say, i changed\nthe value to xx, but nothing changed real on the display.\n\nHas onyone the same problem or possible a solution for this problem?\n\nI don't know where to start debugging...\n\nThanks a lot for all ideas and help.\nRaphael\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
