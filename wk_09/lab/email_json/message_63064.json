Listing a variable name on a line by \nitself only causes it to be printed when you're typing at the console, \nnot when it's a line in a function or a line sourced from a file.  You \nneed to call print() explicitly in those cases.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
