Due to the high\nmulticolinearlity of the data, I want to fit the model using ridge\nregression. However,  I believe that the data from large hospital(indicated\nby the number of  patients they treat a year)  is more accurate than from\nsmall hosptials, and I want to put more weight on them. How do I do this\nwith lm.ridge?\nI know I just need to put \"weights=***\" in lm function, but for lm.ridge, i\ndon't see that option in lm.ridge.\n\nCould somebody give me suggestions on that?\n\n\nthanks\nben\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
