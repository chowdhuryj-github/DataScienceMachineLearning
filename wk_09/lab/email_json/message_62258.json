However, the source tree contains the resulting \ngenerated files.  This means that it's not a requirement to have a lex or \nyacc to build Parrot.\n\nI suppose the theory is that most people don't need to modify the IMCC parser \nand lexer.  Certainly I lived several happy years without doing so.\n\n-- c\n\n"}
