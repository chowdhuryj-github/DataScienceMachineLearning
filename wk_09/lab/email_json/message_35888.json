Windows clients frequently require \n+a reboot in order to clear any cached information about MS-DFS\n+root shares on a server and you may experience failures accessing\n+file services on Samba 3.0.25 servers until the client reboot \n+is performed.  Alternately, you may explicitly re-enable the \n+parameter in smb.conf.   Please refer to the smb.conf(5) man page\n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+\n+######################################################################\n+Changes\n+#######\n+\n+Changes since 3.0.25\n+--------------------\n+\n+o   Michael Adam \n+    * Fix logic in detection of the need to replace dlopen, et. al.\n+    * Add HP-UX ACL VFS module.\n+    * Fix build of Tru64 ACL VFS module.\n+\n+\n+o   Jeremy Allison \n+    * BUG 4622: Fix authentication failures in security = server.\n+    * Fix pointer marshalling in srvsvc parsing code.\n+    * BUG 4630: Fix conversion of 8 byte time_t and NT_TIME values.\n+    * Ensure that if we're blocked on a POSIX lock we know nothing\n+      about that we retry the lock every 10 seconds instead of waiting\n+      for the standard select timeout.\n+    * BUG 4637: Fix samlogon reply regression that broke domain logons.\n+    * Fix rename on open files and improved cdelete-on-close semantics.\n+    * Fix POSIX setfilepathinfo to use lstat.\n+\n+\n+o   Alexander Bokovoy \n+    * Add -pie support to Python's setup.py.\n+    * Strip STYPE_TEMPORARY and STYPE_HIDDEN when printing share\n+      listing from \"net rap shares\".\n+    * Fix argument parsing in \"net rap server domain\".\n+   \n+\n+o   Gerald (Jerry) Carter \n+    * BUG 4616: Don't return a dns or forest name when replying to the\n+      DsGetPrimaryRoleInfo() and configured for security = domain.\n+    * Trim noise by removing redundant WARNING log message that would \n+      flood at log level 2. \n+    * Fix truncation of supplementary Unix groups when using \"force group\".\n+\n+\n+o   Guenther Deschner \n+    * Always fallback to NTLM authentication in pam_winbind when the \n+      user's account has UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set.\n+\n+\n+o   Steve French  \n+    * Valgrind fixes in mount.cifs.\n+\n+\n+o   Volker Lendecke \n+    * Fix crash bug in the Solaria ACL VFS module caused by\n+      uninitialized variables.\n+\n+\n+o   Herb Lewis \n+    * Update connection structure definition for tdbtool display\n+      output.\n+\n+\n+o   Derrell Lipman \n+    * BUG 4601: Fix smbc_getxattr() to properly return the required\n+      size of the buffer needed to contain the extended attributes.\n+    * BUG 4599: Fix failure when setting attributes.\n+    * BUG 4634: Type of the size parameter to getpeername in\n+      libsmbclient code was wrong.\n+    * Fix libsmbclient interaction with links on Vista and properly\n+      detect non-NTSTATUS errors.\n+    \n+\n+o   Jim McDonough \n+    * BUG 4630: Fix special case of unix_to_nt_time() for TIME_T_MAX\n+      and the output from http_timestring().\n+\n+\n+o   Stefan Metzmacher \n+    * Merge gdb_backtrace script changes form SAMBA_4_0.\n+\n+\n+o   Lars Mueller \n+    * Allow idmap_ldap to be built as a shared lib.\n+\n+\n+o   James Peach \n+    * BUG 4426: Move FAM libraries from smbd to vfs_fam_notify.\n+    * BUG 2287: Replace unnecessary AC_TRY_RUN with AC_TRY_LINK.\n+    * BUG 4589: Fix typo in pdbedit output.\n+\n+\n+o   Simo Sorce \n+    * Short circuit Unix Users and Unix Groups Domain SID checks \n+      in smbd to avoid unnecessary calls to winbindd.\n+\n+\n+Please refer to the original Samba\n+3.0.25 Release Notes for more details of changes from previous releases. \n+\n+\n+\n\n\nProperty changes on: trunk/history/samba-3.0.25a.html\n___________________________________________________________________\nName: svn:executable\n   + *\n\nModified: trunk/index.html\n===================================================================\n--- trunk/index.html\t2007-05-18 18:56:23 UTC (rev 1114)\n+++ trunk/index.html\t2007-05-25 04:54:54 UTC (rev 1115)\n@@ -19,71 +19,40 @@\n \n     Current Release\n \n-    14 May 2007\n-    Samba 3.0.25 Available for Download\n+    25 May 2007\n+    Samba 3.0.25a Available for Download\n \n-    Samba 3.0.25 is now available for download.  \n-       This is the first production release of the Samba 3.0.25 code \n+    Samba 3.0.25a is now available for download.  \n+       This is the second production release of the Samba 3.0.25 code \n        base and is the version that servers should be run for for all \n        current bug fixes.\n \n-    The 3.0.25 release is an upgrade release over the 3.0.23/3.0.24 \n-       series which means that a substantial amount of development has \n+    The 3.0.25 release series is an upgrade release over the 3.0.23/3.0.24 \n+       releases which means that a substantial amount of development has \n        occurred and many new features have been added since the last\n        Samba production release.
