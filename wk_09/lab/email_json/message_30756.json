Your 4 reasonable tracks? Your 4 bland \ntracks?\n\nI can't agree about KOTM. I find it to be one of the more redeemable \nsongs on the set. If it were given a SIYL treatment, it would have been \nthat much better.\n\nAnd, looking back, TSW might just be my favorite KB album, taken as a \nwhole. HOL is half-great, but, oh, what a half. I also love TD and NFE. \nSo those are the big 4 long-players for me.\n\nTKI is something special, but not overwhelmingly strong from start to \nfinish. Lionheart and Ae are flawed. TRS suffers from contributions by \nawful mainstream artists who are clearly not worth of Kate Bush.\n\n- Donny\n\n\n\n................................................................\n       Posted via TITANnews - Uncensored Newsgroups Access\n             >>>> at http://www.TitanNews.com <<<<\n-=Every Newsgroup - Anonymous, UNCENSORED, BROADBAND Downloads=-\n\n"}
