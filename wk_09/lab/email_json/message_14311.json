I know that I can get the names of the imported variables with names(). It works. The variable \"ca\" consists of several elements. I want to get the names of the elements to handle my output better. But names(ca) doesn't work. Why? I did the following commands:\n\n> class(ca)\n[1] \"array\"\n> mode(ca)\n[1] \"list\"\n> dim(ca)\n[1] 66  1  1\n> length(ca)\n[1] 66\n\nHow can I now get the names which are stored in ca? When I use the command \"ca[18]\" I receive the content which stands there but not the name collables which I wanted to extract. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks, Corinna \n-- \n\"Feel free\" - 10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat ...\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
