With S I can manage my objects via\nmakefiles.  Corrections to raw data or changes to analysis\nscripts get applied to all objects in the project (and there\nare often thousands of them) by simply typing 'make'.  That\nincludes everything right down to the graphics that will go\nin the report.\n\nHow do people live without that?\n\n--Todd\n-- \nWhy is 'abbreviation' such a long word?\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
