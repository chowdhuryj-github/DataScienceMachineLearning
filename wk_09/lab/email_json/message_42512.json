If you called a\nsubroutine in the normal way, perl would leave your argument list\nalone. But when you make a method call, perl adds the class name (or\nblessed object) as the first parameter.\n\n    # Without method syntax, manually include the class name\n    &Horse::speak(\"Horse\");\n\n    # With method syntax, perl adds it for you\n    Horse->speak();\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
