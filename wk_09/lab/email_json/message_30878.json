I thought that\nwith a Kubuntu, it would be faster and easier. It was for some stuff, but\nNetworkManager /managed/ (sic) to freeze my keyboard several times. As I\nhad ever done it, I hand-configured wpasupplicant in roaming mode and it\nworks like a charm...\n\nAnd I get a lot more little annoying bugs under this all shiny new version\nof Kubuntu than I would ever have with Etch. OK, (K)Ubuntu is more on the\nbleeding (positively AND negatively) edge.\n\nAnd well... My preference for Debian is a lot more for \"ethical\" reasons\nthan for technical ones.\n\nRegards, \n\nDidier\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
