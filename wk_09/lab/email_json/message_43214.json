Do industrial design rights\naffect the creation or distribution of the .blend files of such\nobjects? Is there any other legal measure that restricts the creation\nand redistribution of 3d models?\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
