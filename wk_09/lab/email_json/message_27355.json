I want to calculate the 99%VaR/1 day for the stock fonds, after sorting \nthe values the 5th or 6th value is it?\nIn Historical simulation it is the 5th value...... because it tells you to \nbe more cautious that a higher loss 'may' be there, secondly VaR only \nshows the possibility and not the maximum loss which you can incur :-) \ncheers\n2. How do I calculate it under normal distribution aproximation? \nWell there is also a normal method or variance - covariance method which \nassumes normal distribution :-) \nif you want to incorporate recency effect then you can also see boudhouks \nmethod \n\ntry this  paper which will give you very good understanding of various \nmethods of VaR \n\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=51420#PaperDownload \n\n\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++\napply(tstock,2,function(x) VaR(x,alpha=0.01)) # are these the right VaR's\nfor the stockfonds?\n@@@ you can yourself see it, you have around 579 observation and 1% of it \nmean 5.79th observation \nThus if you become risk averse then you take the 5th smallest value and \notherwise 6th value. \nSo just sort the returns in ascending order and then see the 5th and the \n6th values \n\n\n> sorted_espa_stock_europe<-sort(tstock[,2]) \n> sorted_espa_stock_europe[5] \n[1] -2.86 \n> sorted_espa_stock_europe[6] \n[1] -2.74 \n> \n\nyour code gives -2.86 thus you can get the rest :-) cheers \n\n\n============================================================================================\nDISCLAIMER AND CONFIDENTIALITY CAUTION:\n\nThis message and any attachments with it (the \"message\") are confidential \nand intended\nsolely for the addressees.
