I am using R version 2.5.\n\nThe installation of the RWinEdt library is funny. First, it didn't\ninstall at all. Then, I uninstalled/reinstalled both R and WinEdt,\ndownloaded the package again from the CRAN repositary, got some error\nmessages, but RWinEdt initialized. I closed R and WinEdt, launched R\nagain, type \"library(RWinEdt)\", and got several dialogue boxes\n(again), asking if I wanted to creat shortcuts, etc. Then, RWinEdt\ndidn't work anymore.\n\nI'm sorry for the messy email, but I've done so many\ninstallations/uninstallations/re installations, that I am alos\nconfused.\n\nI guess the ultimate questions is: are there any known issued between\nR, RWinEdt and Windows Vista?\n\nI appreciate any help.\nThanks,\nDimitri\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
