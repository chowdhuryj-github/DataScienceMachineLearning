I have been unable to find an R function (either in the\nbase or in a package available on cran) that performs either of these\ntests. Does one exist that I am overlooking or is there code available\nelsewhere to do this?\n \nAs background, I am using vglm( ) from the library VGAM to fit the\nmodel. I'm estimating the model with code that looks roughly like this: \nvglm(y~x1+x2+x3, data=mydata, family=cumulative(link = \"logit\", parallel\n= T, reverse = T))\n\nThank you,\nRose\n \n \n\n______________________________________\n\nRose Anne Medeiros\n\nStatistical Consulting Group\n\nUCLA Academic Technology Services\n\nhttp://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
