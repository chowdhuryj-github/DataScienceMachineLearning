Sincerely,  /iaw\n\nIf I understand what you're asking, I don't think so.\n\nd$columnname\n\nextracts an element of the list d.  It's typically some sort of vector, \nand vectors don't know what their own name is.\n\nnames(d$columnname)\n\nlooks for a names attribute on that vector.  If it doesn't have one, \nyou'll get NULL.\n\nThere are plenty of functions in R which depend on the form of the \nargument passed to them, not just its value, but we shouldn't add more \nwithout a very good reason.  The change you ask for would mess up the \nfollowing calculation:\n\n > x <- 1:26\n > names(x) <- letters\n > d <- list(columnname=x)\n > names(d$columnname)\n  [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\" \"g\" \"h\" \"i\" \"j\" \"k\" \"l\" \"m\" \"n\" \"o\" \"p\" \n\"q\" \"r\"\n[19] \"s\" \"t\" \"u\" \"v\" \"w\" \"x\" \"y\" \"z\"\n\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
