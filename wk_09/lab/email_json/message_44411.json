Having started in the telecommunications industry, revenue assurance management has become the mantra of achieving operating efficiency. Now, Wall Street, private equity, and deregulation are forcing energy companies to more aggressively tackle their cost and loss issues.\n\u00a0\nRevenue leakage can be a significant problem for an energy company. A revenue assurance solution involves a series of activities to ensure that the business processes, controls, organizational structure and information systems related to the revenue cycle work together effectively to maximize revenues and operating margins.\n\u00a0\nTogether, we will explore what revenue assurance programs should be initiated, when the project should be undertaken, who in the organization will sponsor them, and what technologies would be leveraged to maximize these solutions.\n\u00a0\nWhat Attendees Will Learn:\n\u00a0\n\nRevenue Assurance Basics\n\nCommon Symptoms and Causes for Revenue Leakage\n\nIdentifying Common Exposure Points\n\nDesigning Effective Revenue Controls\n\nDesigning a Revenue Assurance Organization\n\nBilling Fraud Detection and Prevention\n\nDeveloping a Revenue Assurance Dashboard and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nRevenue Assurance Technology and Tools\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\u00a0\nThe seminar is designed for executive and management level personnel whose responsibilities may include customer service, billing, collections, internal audit, and loss prevention. In addition, information technology personnel who have overseen Customer Information System (CIS) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) projects are also strongly encouraged to attend.\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n \nNAESB\nGas Contracts\nChicago, IL\nJune 12, 2007\n\u00a0\nNatural\nGas 101\nHouston, TX\nJune 13, 2007\n\u00a0\nISDA\nMaster Agreements\nChicago, IL\nJune 13, 2007\n\u00a0\nEEI\nMaster Agreements for Power Trading\nChicago, IL\nJune 14, 2007\n\u00a0\nIntro to\nElectric Utility Systems for Non Engineers\nAustin, TX\nJune 14-15, 2007\n\u00a0\nDistributed\nEnergy Resources-Emerging Business Models for Utilities\nAustin, TX\nJune 14-15, 2007\n\u00a0\nManaging\nPhysical & Financial Uncertainty in the Power Industry\nNew York, NY\nJune 19-20, 2007\n\u00a0\nValue\nand Risk in Energy Markets - Introduction & Principles (Program 8)\nSan Diego, CA\nJune 19-21, 2007\n\u00a0\nFAS133:\nDerivatives Accounting\nHouston, TX\nJune 20, 2007\n\u00a0\nNatural\nGas 101\nTulsa, OK\nJune 20, 2007\n\u00a0\nNatural Gas Hedging\nfor the Producer & User\nHouston, TX\nJune 21, 2007\n\u00a0\nAlternative\nRegulation for Electric and Gas Utilities\nBoston, MA\nJune 25-26, 2007\n\u00a0\nIn Depth\nIntroduction to Electricity Markets\nAlexandria, VA\nJune 25-26, 2007\n\u00a0\nCarbon\nEmissions: Understanding and Managing Carbon Risk\nAlexandria, VA\nJune 25-26, 2007\n\u00a0\nCustomer\nCommunications for Utilities\nBoston, MA\nJune 27-28, 2007\n\u00a0\nPublic\nParticipation in Utility Siting\nBoston, MA\nJune 27-28, 2007\n\u00a0\nEEI's 2007\nTransmission and Wholesale Market School\nMadison, WI\nJuly 9-13, 2007\n\u00a0\nNatural\nGas 101\nCharleston, WV\nJuly 11, 2007\n\u00a0\nCarbon\nSequestration Development & Finance Summit\nHouston, TX\nJuly 11-13, 2007\n\u00a0\nCoal\nCombustion Products\nCharlotte, NC\nJuly 16-17, 2007\n\u00a0\nT & D\nAsset Management\nCharlotte, NC\nJuly 16-17, 2007\n\u00a0\nWind\nPower Development Tutorial\nDenver, CO\nJuly 16-18, 2007\n\u00a0\nFERC\nElectric 101\nDenver, CO\nJuly 17-18, 2007\n\u00a0\nEnergy\nTrading Regulations\nHouston, TX\nJuly 18, 2007\n\u00a0\nEEI\nMaster Agreements for Power Trading\nHouston, TX\nJuly 20, 2007\n\u00a0\nElectric\nPower Planning\nSan Francisco, CA\nJuly 23-24, 2007\n\u00a0\nNERC\nReliability Standards\nSan Francisco, CA\nJuly 23-24, 2007\n\u00a0\nProject\nFinance Tutorial\nNew York, NY\nJuly 23-25, 2007\n\u00a0\nDiversity\nand Inclusion- Best Practices\nSan Francisco, CA\nJuly 24-25, 2007\n\u00a0\nEnergy\nEfficiency, Demand Response and Load Management\nSan Francisco, CA\nJuly 24-27, 2007\n\u00a0\nRevenue\nManagement\nSan Francisco, CA\nJuly 26-27, 2007\n\u00a0\nNew FERC\nFiling and FASB Fair Valuation Standards\nChicago, IL\nJuly 30-31, 2007\n\u00a0\nPower\nDelivery Planning: Managing the Distribution Planning Process to Maximize Value\nChicago, IL\nAug 1-2, 2007\n\u00a0\nElectric\nSafety in Utilities\nWashington, DC\nAug 15-16, 2007\n\u00a0\nProtective\nRelaying\nWashington, DC\nAug 16-17, 2007\n\u00a0\nFAS133:\nDerivatives Accounting\nHouston, TX\nAugust 21, 2007\n\u00a0\nNatural Gas Hedging\nfor the Producer & User\nHouston, TX\nAugust 27, 2007\n\n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
