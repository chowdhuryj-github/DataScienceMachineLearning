As factors - which is what bocplot will turn them into -  they will be treated as arbitrary labels and _numbered_ 1:3 (try as.numeric(factor(x)). \n\nSo your lm() used 2:4, but your plot (and abline) uses 1:3 for positions and \"2\" - \"4\" as labels. \n\nThe best option used to be to plot the boxes at positions 2:4. Look at the at= parameter in boxplot.\nBut that is now of little help because there is no way of overriding xlim, leaving you no alternative but to reformulate your model with an offset or something. \n\nI will take up the boxplot xlim issue separately on R-dev; it's not the only such.\n\nSteve Ellison.\n\n>>> \"Brian Wilfley\"  21/06/2007 22:44:17 >>>\nI'm trying to add lines to a plot originally made with \"boxplot\", but\nthe lines appear in the wrong place. \n\n*******************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential.
