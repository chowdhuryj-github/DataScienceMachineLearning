Every new major version\nof Perl has had some pretty radical stuff in it.  That said, it is a\ndesign goal to let the users still write Perl 5 syntax in a\ncompatibility mode, but if you do that then you miss out on all of the\ncool stuff like hyperoperators, the new rule based regexes, pointy\nblocks, etc.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
