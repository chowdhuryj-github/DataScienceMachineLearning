Mark said the\nGuide was good, but podcasters knew it was written for the U.S. market\nand felt it had limited use in Canada. Mark asked if CC Canada could\ncreate a Canadian version of the Guide that Canadian podcasters could\nrely on.\n\nKathleen Simmons and I have worked over the last few months to do just\nthat and we were very happy to launch the Podcasting Legal Guide for\nCanada this past weekend at the Podcasters Across Borders conference in\nKingston, Ontario. There were printed copies for everybody at the\nconference, but you can get your own copy in pdf format on our website:\n\nhttp://www.creativecommons.ca/blog/archives/2007/06/26/podcasting-legal-guide-for-canada/\n\nCheers,\nAndy\n\n-- \nAndy Kaplan-Myrth, LL.B., M.A.\nProject Lead, Creative Commons Canada\n------------------------------------------------\nemail: andy@creativecommons.ca\nweb: http://www.creativecommons.ca\n------------------------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
