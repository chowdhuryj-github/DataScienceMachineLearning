Key variables include\nthe dichotomous outcome, dichotomous exposure, and the stratum to which\neach person belongs. \n\nUsing this individual-level dataset I can successfully use clogit to\ncreate the model I want. However reading this large .csv file into R and\nrunning the models takes a fair amount of time.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose to \"collapse\" the dataset so that each row\nhas the number of events, number of individuals, and the exposure and\nstratum. In SAS they call this the \"events/trials\" format. This would\nmake my dataset much smaller and presumably speed things up.\n\nSo my question is: can I use clogit (or possibly another function) to\nperform a conditional logistic regression when the data is in this\n\"events/trials\" format? I am using R version 2.5.0.\n\nThank you very much, \nMatt Strickland\nBirth Defects Branch\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
