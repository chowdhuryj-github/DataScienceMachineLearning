It is part of the VR bundle, which\nmay be why you missed it. \n\nThe code is well documented and the package is closely tied to two books\n(see the references in ?nnet). \n\nAlso, it has a predict function, which many of the others do not. This\nisn't too big of a deal, but it certainly speaks to good design.\n\nMax\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Ehsan Rasa\nSent: Tuesday, June 05, 2007 11:45 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] Neural Net. in R\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm a graduate student of engineering, lately introduced with R. and\nusing R\nfor my project and thesis. I'm trying to use R for implementing a neural\nnetwork regression model and apply it to my database. I found three R\npackages (\"AMORE\" , \"grnnR\" , \"neural\") in R website, but their manuals\nare\nnot really user-friendly in my idea. I was wondering if anyone has a\nwritten\ncode in R using any of these packages for a feed-forward\nback-propagation\nneural network in R that I can use it. That'll be a remedy for my\nnightmare\nwhich already took quite time from me.\nI would really appreciate it.\n\nSincerely,\nJason.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nLEGAL NOTICE\\ Unless expressly stated otherwise, this messag...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
