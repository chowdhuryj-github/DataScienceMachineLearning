Introduction to\nR makes it sound like both should be saved, and it clearly happened for\nme at some point in the past:  I have some (very old) commands in my\n.Rhistory, and these are loaded at startup, but new entries are not\nadded.\n\nIs this a bug, or am I doing something wrong??\n\nMuch thanks,\nIan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
