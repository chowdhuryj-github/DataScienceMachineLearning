The fiscal gap measures the \u00a0difference between our government's projected future expenditures and \u00a0tax receipts; this means, according to some economists, that our \u00a0government is technically bankrupt. To help manage debt, the \u00a0government is required to print money which means rising inflation \u00a0(causing your savings to lose purchasing power). Precious metals such \u00a0as gold are one of the few safe-haven investments to protect against \u00a0inflation and unchecked government spending.World oil prices are rising. With OPEC's commitment to higher prices, \u00a0\nthe geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, and the very real \u00a0prospect that global oil supplies will diminish while current and \u00a0increased global demand from countries such as India and China will \u00a0grow, oil prices should increase significantly. Higher oil prices \u00a0drive gold prices higher as it spurs inflation throughout our economy.\nRead the full report\nRead the full disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    This email was sent to:  ktwarwic@flax24.uwaterloo.ca\n\n\n\n\n                                                            This email was sent by: The Bull Report                                                                                                              \n                                                            1846 rosemeade 104 dallas, TX 75007 USA \n                                                            \n\n\n          \n                                    We respect your right to privacy - view our policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Subscriptions | \n                                    Update Profile | \n                                    One-Click Unsubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
