Please post the output of the following three commands:\n\ncat /etc/debian_version\nuname -a\ndpkg -l aptitude libc6 xorg | tail -n 3\n\nWhat you say sounds like you tried to upgrade from Sarge to Etch, but we\nneed to know for sure.\n\n-- \nRegards,            | http://users.icfo.es/Florian.Kulzer\n          Florian   |\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
