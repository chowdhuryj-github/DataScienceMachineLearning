It's true that \nclass methods and vtable overrides are moving out of the namespace, \nwhich means the feature will no longer be relevant to classes.\n\n> As a feature, this could do a world of hurt.

Direct import/export is really for libraries. \nClasses use composition of roles.\n\nAllison\n\n"}
