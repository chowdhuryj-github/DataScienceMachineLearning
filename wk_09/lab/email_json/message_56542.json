See whether adding this to\nyour program gives you the full stack backtrace:\n\n    BEGIN { $Carp::Verbose = 1 }\n\nWhen you find the problem, I'm sure that the module's author would\nappreciate a patch that improves the error handling. Good luck with\nit!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
