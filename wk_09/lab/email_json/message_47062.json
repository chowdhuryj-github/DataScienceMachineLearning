No test has yet been written in part  \nbecause this is a subroutine which is not really well positioned in  \nits current package.  Everything else in Parrot::Configure has to do  \nwith initial configuration; runstep() has to do with *re-running* a  \nstep after Configure.pl has already completed.  It's a tool that some  \nParrot developers use (Patrick Michaud has spoken up for it), but is  \nnot used by make.\n\nAdditional problem:  Parrot::Configure also has subroutines named  \nrunstep() and _runstep().  Ideally, any refactoring would include  \nless confusing names.\n\nBecause runstep() runs after Configure.pl, any tests for it should go  \ninto the t/postconfigure/ directory.\n\nSo the task is to write unit tests for Parrot::Configure::runstep()  \nand, if appropriate, to refactor it, with that refactoring possibly  \nincluding renaming and/or relocating the subroutine.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
