It is\nhard to say without trying some things, but I would check\n\nIs the IDE cable inserted the right way up in the drive.\nSome drives will only let you insert it one way, others\nwill let you do it upside down.\n\nIs the IDE cable inserted into the first IDE controller\nport on motherboard. Best way to check is in BIOS,\nyou should see the drive as master.\n\nIs the power cable inserted in the drive.\n\nIf more than one drive on same cable, one must be\nset as master, one as slave, done by jumpers using\nthe label on drive as guide. As suggested before if\nthere already is another drive, try removing it and\nboot with just the newly setup drive.\n\nIf all the physical connections seem okay, the next\nthing I would do is boot from a CD or floppy and\ndo what I said before, at the boot prompt enter\n\nkernel-name root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro\n\nwhere kernel-name is the name of kernel on the\nremovable media, and the kernel is a \"bare\" one,\nnot specific to hardware, ie its 386 and generic\ncontrollers. On slackware its called bare.i but\nthere should be an equivalent on debian. And\nmake sure the root= points to the right drive\nletter and number of the partition with the root\nfile system.\n\nYou could also try loading a generic kernel on\nthe AMD, making sure it boots there, then\nmoving the kernel over. You'll have to check\nthe debian docs to find out which kernel to use.\nI haven't use debian in a while.\n\n> How hard are these floppies to get for deb?\n\nhttp://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-i386/current//images/floppy/\nhttp://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch04s03.html.en\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Thanks,\n> Thanks,\n> ~~TheCreator~~\n> [My programs don't have bugs; just randomly added features]\n> msn:\n> compgeek13@gmail.com\n> aim: st8amnd2005\n> skype: st8amnd127\n> vertigo head coder\n> web: tysdomain.com\n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Spie Sutherland\" \n> To: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\"\n\n> Sent: Saturday, June 16, 2007 7:03 PM\n> Subject: Re: switching from amd to p3\n>\n>\n> > If you're getting disk boot failure then probably something\n> > is not right with the physical connection, the IDE cable or\n> > possibly the BIOS needs to be tweaked to recognize the\n> > hard drive.
