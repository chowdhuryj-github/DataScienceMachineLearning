That is, can I write a program based on this \nlibrary and GPL it? As I read it, it is GPL-compatible. But for \nverification I asked the FSF people to check it, and though they did not \ngive an official approval/disapproval, they said they \"thought\" it would \nnot be compatible because it is based on the QPL. Of course this reply \nwas from a volunteer and not from any authority at FSF.\n\nI pointed out to them that the SEPL does not have the \"modifications to \nbe redistributed as patches only\" restriction which is the basic problem \nwith the QPL, but after that I did not get any reply from them at all.\n\nI would really like to use this library (Swiss Ephemeris) but I have to \nGPL my program since I use Qt OSS edition. I asked the people who wrote \nand hence own the library whether I can GPL a program based on their \nlibrary but they said no \"because it would allow commercial use of the \nlibrary which is not permitted by the SEPL\". Again I feel they have \nconfused commercial software and proprietary software.\n\nSo I request and hope that the good people here help me reach a decision \n- whether the SEPL is GPL-compatible or not. If it is not, please tell \nme what is the problem.\n\nAlso when a licence is GPL-compatible it is also automatically \nDFSG-compatible, right?\n\nThanks.\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
