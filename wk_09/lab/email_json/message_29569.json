Is there a way\nto set up the package to not re-check that Rnw file?\n\nOne way I thought of was to have the Rnw file renamed and put in as a\ndocumentation, so that it is still referencable as a documentation\nfile, but is there a better way to flag R CMD check on what it should\nignore?\n\nSincerely,\nArjun Ravi Narayan\narjunravinarayan@gmail.com\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
