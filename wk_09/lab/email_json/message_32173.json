The spirit of the old Wembley remains, but the FA have delivered a brand new sparkling stadium of which we can all be proud.\n\n\nWas it worth the wait? Well I think we would all have liked to have seen it delivered sooner, but I've no doubt everyone will be mightily impressed with it.\n\n\nAnd what better way to celebrate than with the best two teams in the country slugging it out?\n\n\nAll week I've been asked to predict the outcome of the final, but this is a game that's just too close to call - you might as well flip a coin.\n\n\nManchester United had the upper hand in the Premiership and will probably go into the match in better mental shape than Chelsea, but whether that will be enough to win the Cup I don't know.\n\n\nChelsea will feel they have a point to prove, and are a very talented and resilient side.\n\n\nThe FA Cup is the only domestic trophy Jose Mourinho hasn't won at Chelsea, and he's not a man who accepts failure.\n\n\nBig games bring out the best in big players, and there will be plenty of those on show on Saturday - Drogba, Rooney, Terry, Ferdinand, Scholes, Lampard.\n\n\nBut I have to reserve special praise for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\nThere's no doubt this has been the Portuguese winger's season. He's been brilliant.\n\n\nTo perform the way he has in the face of so much criticism after the World Cup is very impressive and he thoroughly deserves his player of the year awards.\n\n\nEnjoy the Cup final,\n\n\nAlan\n\n\nAlan Shearer was an FA Cup finalist with Newcastle in 1998 and 1999. He will be a guest in the Match of the Day studio at Wembley on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS WEEKEND ON BBC SPORT\n\u00a0All the TV and radio times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFA CUP FINAL ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/football\nSaturday\nFull coverage all day on bbc.co.uk/football; Match of the Day Live: FA Cup final - Chelsea v Man Utd (1240 BST, BBC ONE; kick off 1500 Radio Five Live/online).
