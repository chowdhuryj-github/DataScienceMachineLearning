I want to run Linux on\nit as it's probably going to be the best os for the hardware that the\ncomputer will have in it.  One of the things that I want to do is run an\necho link interface to the local ham radio repeater here in Muskegon.  On\nthe web site for echo link, the only mention of the software running with\nLinux is by using wine.  Now I'm not the brightest bulb in the box, but I'm\nthinking that wine is some sort of graphical program.  Is this the case, and\nif it is, does speakup or any speech software for that matter read this\nparticular program at all?  \n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\n \n\nChris Schulte\n\n \n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
