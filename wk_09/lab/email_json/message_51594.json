That will happen if, e.g., other\nprocesses or Windows itself need RAM. Though R keeps the data in\nRAM, under Windows, non-SCSI disk I/O puts a noticeable load on\nthe CPU. As SCSI controllers have CPUs of their own, they\noffload much of that work from the system CPU.\n\nI have compared dual-processor computers with equal RAM, one\nwith a SCSI subsystem and one with fast (7200 RPM) ATA disks and\nslightly faster CPUs.  One was my work machine, one my home. The\ndifference was not subtle.  For another example, think of how\nslow laptops seem when multitasking, compared to a good\nworkstation. It is usually the poor disk subsystem that's the\nbottleneck, not the CPU.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Prager, NOAA, Beaufort, NC\n* Opinions expressed are personal and not represented otherwise.\n* Any use of tradenames does not constitute a NOAA endorsement.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
