I use espeak instead of flite, both for personal \nreasons and because flite causes static on the emulated es1371.\n    Granted, I'm mostly intending this VM as a Linux server, so won't be \nplaying much MP3 audio or the like on it.  But we'll see.\nThanks,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Tyler Spivey\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Sunday, April 15, 2007 9:35 PM\nSubject: Re: VmWare\n\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> I've installed everything from FreeBSD to Solaris to Linux in a vm, and\n> am getting quite good at it now.
