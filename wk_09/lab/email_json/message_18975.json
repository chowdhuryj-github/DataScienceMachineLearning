After PCMCIA loads the whole boot\nand system is very slow. Older computers boot faster... I don't know\nwhat the problem is, but I'd like to disable pcmcia that I enabled\nduring installation. Problem is that I cannot figure out how to do it.\nEven if I add nopcmcia and acpi=off to the grub boot it loads pcmcia.\n\nGoogling doesn't show anywhere how to get rid of pcmcia except during\ninstallation.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nPreben\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
