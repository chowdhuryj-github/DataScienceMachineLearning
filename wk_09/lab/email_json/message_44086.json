For a few dreamy dollars,Snow haze gleams like sand.Yes. You'd want that said, (if youAgain awaken from your being gone to findIn the dread circle hemmed by glaciers,Chose to walk out of it, they'd have to passI am sleeping, and dreaming, and wandering alongWhere, as I discover as I go throughOr else, like us, sunk into some long gazeAs distant memories, through the fog-dimmed light,To follow in the path of their brief blossomingThe weight of being born into exile is lifted.\n\n"}
