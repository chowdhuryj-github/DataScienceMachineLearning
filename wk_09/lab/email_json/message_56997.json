Your reply reminds me that book. I've read it\nlong time ago, but haven't  try the weights option in my projects\nyet:)\n\nIs the heteroscedastic test always less powerful because we have to\nestimate the within group variance from the given data?\n\nShould we check whether each group has equal variance before using\nweights=varIdent()? If we should, what is the function for linear\nmixed model?\n\nThanks,\nShirley\n\nOn 6/27/07, Simon Blomberg  wrote:\n> The default settings for lme do assume equal variances within groups.\n> You can change that by using the various varClasses. see ?varClasses.
