The \nWilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test is sensitive to differences in shape, in rather \ncomplex ways, more so than t.test. (I've posted simulated comparisons here \nin the past.)\n\nI don't think anyone is answering the question here.  If the distributions \nare identical in shape, the Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test is measuring \ndifferences in means, medians ... (they are all the same), and if they are \nnot, it is not measuring differences in medians.\n\nTo test specifically for a difference in medians, you can do almost the \nsame thing as the Welch two-sample t-test, but use estimates of the \nasympototic standard errors of the medians (for which you will need\ndensity estimates at the medians).\n\nBut I can only see this as being worth doing where the median is of \nsubstantive interest (as it could just be for lifetime distributions), and \nstatistical significance is of importance (rather than useful \nimprovement).\n\n-- \nBrian D.
