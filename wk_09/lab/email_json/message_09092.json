Or more accurately, the \nword \"Debian\" is a trademark registered by SPI on behalf of the Debian \nProject.\nIt is regerstered in the category: \"IC 009. US 021 023 026 036 038. G & S: \nComputer Utility and Operating System Software.\"\nTrademark serial number 75386376.\n\nThe only other trademark registered by SPI is \"Open Source\", which is now a \nDead Mark. This was from before OSI has split off.\n\nSo it does not look like the logos are registered marks. \n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
