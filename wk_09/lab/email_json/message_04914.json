As noted in other replies, lapply will operate on the\ncolumns of a data.frame since a data.frame is a list.  But the return\nvalue will be a list, not a data.frame.\n\nI think for loops get a bad wrap.  There are times when they are\nappropriate and even optimal in R programming.\n\n+ seth\n\n-- \nSeth Falcon | Computational Biology | Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nhttp://bioconductor.org\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
