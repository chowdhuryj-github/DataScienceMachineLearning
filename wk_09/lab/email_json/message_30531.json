The Rev. Jerry Falwell died this afternoon. The cause of his death wasn\u2019t\n  immediately disclosed, but he\u2019s had a history of heart trouble. \n\u00a0\nIn his life, he was seen as a visionary to some\n  conservatives and an archenemy to liberals. Falwell leaves a legacy of\n  founding the Moral Majority, bolstering the evangelical community and\n  sculpting it into a major political force. Our Richard Schlesinger will tell\n  the story of this influential man\u2019s life.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll also have a slate of in-depth interviews\n  with religious leaders, academics and public figures about Rev. Falwell\u2019s\n  impact on religion and politics in America.\n\u00a0\nIn other news, the search continues for information\n  about three U.S. soldiers\n  feared captured by an al Qaeda group during a weekend ambush in Iraq.\n  Troops have detained 11 people and questioned hundreds in connection with the\n  attack.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi is at Fort\n    Drum, New York,\n  where the troops killed and kidnapped last weekend were based. \n\u00a0\nOne of the savviest ways companies are reaching kids\n  is through the Internet.
