The course will be held just\nbefore the JSM, on Saturday, 28 July 2007, in Salt Lake City. The\ncourse will be presented by Dianne Cook and Hadley Wickham.\n\nIn the course you will learn:\n\n* How to build presentation quality static graphics using the R\npackage, ggplot. We will cover plot creation and modification, and\ndiscuss the grammar which underlies the package.\n\n* How to explore your data with direct manipulation/dynamic graphics\nusing GGobi and rggobi. You'll learn the general toolbox, as well\nspecific approaches for dealing with missing data, supervised\nclassification, cluster analysis and multivariate longitudinal data\nanalysis.\n\nDianne Cook is a full professor at Iowa State University. She has been\nan active researcher in the field of interactive and dynamic graphics\nfor 16 years, and regularly teaches information visualization,\nmultivariate analysis and data mining.\n\nHadley Wickham is a PhD student at Iowa State University. He won the\nJohn Chambers Award for statistical computing in 2006 for his work on\nggplot.\n\nFor more details, or to book your place, please see http://lookingatdata.com\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
