This is a survey\nof 35 different existing and proposed patent pools, covering different\ntechnologies and time periods, beginning in the nineteen century through\nthe present.\n\nPatent pools have been widely used to achieve a number of different\nobjectives, including some that were anticompetitive, and others that\nimproved social welfare. As the title of the research note indicates,\nthe research shows a variety of purposes and management structures.\nThere is no single reason for creating a patent pool, and no single way\nto manage a patent pool.\n\nThe Research Note is available on html and pdf formats here:\nhttp://www.keionline.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69\n\n\n--\nJudit Rius Sanjuan\nAttorney\njudit.rius@keionline.org\n\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nwww.keionline.org / www.cptech.org\n1621 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 500 Washington, DC 20009 USA\nTel.: +1.202.332.2670, Ext 18  Fax: +1.202.332.2673\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
