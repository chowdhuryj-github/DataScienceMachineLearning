I ve run\nnormality tests using 8 different methods:\n- Lilliefors\n- Shapiro-Wilk\n- Robust Jarque Bera\n- Jarque Bera\n- Anderson-Darling\n- Pearson chi-square\n- Cramer-von Mises\n- Shapiro-Francia\n\nAll show that the null hypothesis that the data come from a normal\ndistro cannot be rejected. Great. However, I don't think it looks nice\nto report the values of 8 different tests on a report. One note is\nthat my sample size is really tiny (less than 20 independent cases).\nWithout wanting to start a flame war, are there any advices of which\none/ones would be more appropriate and should be reported (along with\na Q-Q plot). Thank you.\n\nRegards,\n\n-- \nyianni\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
