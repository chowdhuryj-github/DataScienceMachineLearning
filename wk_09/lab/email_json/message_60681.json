But under Russian law (the law of his \nlocal jurisdiction) it was MANDATORY!\n\nYou're basically claiming that if American law flatly contradicts the \nlaw of some other country, then people living in that country have to \nignore their own law and abide by American law instead !!!\n\nCheers,\nWol\n-- \nAnthony W.
