Your \nselection test is wrong (you want to test for NA Priority).\nSomething like\n\nneed <- as.vector(ip[is.na(ip[, \"Priority\"]), 1])\n\n> 2: dependencies 'Design', 'graph', 'RBGL' are not available\n\n\"graph\" and \"RBGL\" are on Bioconductor, and using 'Select repositories' \nfrom the menu to add that repoository would have found them.\n\nFor \"Design\", \"dynamicGraph\", \"ggplot\", \"ref\" see\n\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/checkSummaryWin.html\n\nCRAN does not distribute binary versions of packages that fail their \ntests.\n\nAFAIK tapiR has been withdrawn from CRAN.\n\n\n> Sure enough, those in warning 1 were all in the 2.4.1 library directory\n> tree and those in warning 2 weren't.
