In line 60 of file \"\nSearnShell.pl\" a pipe is opened. The program executes correctly until line 745 of file \"SearnShell.pl\" which is \"my $result = <SearchR>;\". \"$result\" is supposed to receive a value from another end of the pipe but it receives nothing...The other end of pipe is in line 17 of file \"\nControl.pm\" which is \" while (<>) { \". It is supposed to receive the input from line 744 of file \"SearnShell.pl\" and do some comparing works and then print \"OK\\n\" . Unfortunately, \" while (<>) \" receives nothing...As a result the whole thing can not work rightly.\n\nSo I guess the problem is \" while (<>) \" in line 17 of file \"Control.pm\" receives nothing . I don't konw why it happens and really hope you can get me out of this confusion....\n\nsincerely,\nbecky\n"}
