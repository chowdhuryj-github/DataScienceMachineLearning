Granted, it's a \ntext file, and Excel is opening a text file, but none the less, I \nthink that qualifies as exporting to Excel, considering that the \ncontents of the data frame are now in Excel and one can do whatever \nformatting one wishes to do.

Of \ncourse, that does require learning and using tex or latex, for which \nSweave can help, as Gabor mentioned.\n\n>\n>Thanks for any suggestions,\n>\n>-W\n>\n>--\n>Weiwei Shi, Ph.D\n>Research Scientist\n>GeneGO, Inc.\n\n-Don\n\n-- \n---------------------------------\nDon MacQueen\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\nLivermore, CA, USA\n925-423-1062\nmacq@llnl.gov\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
