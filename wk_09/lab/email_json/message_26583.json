But, that doesn't stop \nme from ridiculing the hypocrisy of celebrities who do.\n\nIf you want to blame someone/thing for global warming, check out the sun \nand cyclical warming/cooling cycles. We were in a cooling period from \nthe 1950s to the 1970s, even while our carbon dioxide production was \nskyrocketing--imagine that.\n\n> Great.\n> \n> I wonder, have any of the lh's made a concerted effort to reduce their \n> carbon footprint?\n\nNot too many, I'd guess. All of these Global Warming Alarmists want \nsomeone else to do all the savings, or they want to get off easy by \nbuying the bogus global warming offsets, which are clearly a joke.\n\n- Donny\n\n\n\n................................................................\n       Posted via TITANnews - Uncensored Newsgroups Access\n             >>>> at http://www.TitanNews.com <<<<\n-=Every Newsgroup - Anonymous, UNCENSORED, BROADBAND Downloads=-\n\n"}
