Any simple way to detect the\npossible compromise? I presently examine my daily log of incoming and\noutgoing emails for anomalies, check for rootkits, etc., and have so\nfar been fortunate (I think).\n\nBTW, the answer to my original question seems to be that I ought to\nopen ports on the server side to support passive mode.

Not much of a\nbenefit, and way too much risk.\n\nChuck\n\n\n-- \nThe Moon is Full\n My home page with some downloads is at http://www.mhcable.com/~chuckh\n The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
