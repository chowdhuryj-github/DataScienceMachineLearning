The only drawback I can see is that it's no longer \"charitable\" when\nthey are fed back into the commercial ticketing system, you'd have to create\nsome kind of not-for-profit deriv.  Renders the whole thing a bit of a\nnon-starter.  Though having said that they could do \"free\" concerts and\nbring along the t-shirts and the merch......who knows.\n\n> >\n> > > > Historically, bundled into the\n> > > > cost of each CD or book is the cost of production and\n> > > > distribution.

To be honest I'm not entirely convinced they're aware\nof the options, otherwise they may have opted for something more open.\nReading their occasional interviews and posts they seem keen to duck out of\nthe traditional systems.  I was also encouraged recently by something Thom\nYork said about wanting to do something similar in Time Magazine.\n\nShould CC have some kind of lobbying group to stalk these artists? lol :)\n\n> >\n> > http://www.thecrimea.net/\n> >\n> > They're smart enough to realise it'll benefit them in the longrun, as\nfar\n> > as gigs and promotion goes.

That's exactly the kind of thing I'd love to see, and I agree, I'd\nhappily pay good money for something like that.  I think one of the issues\nwith CDs is that the price remained fixed whilst the \"costs\" bottomed out.\nMost music lovers and consumers are well aware of the costs now, especially\nas daily newspapers include \"free\" CDs and DVDs whilst still paying dues to\nthe artists and creators.  It's difficult to convince people to pay for data\nI guess.\n\nSo it's the additional and exclusive things people expect to pay more for,\nthe physical things they can touch, wear or play with.  I kept my old vinyl\nbecause some of the artwork is simply iconic, awesome stuff from the 70s and\n80s.  I was thinking of framing some of those old album covers.\n\nIt'd be great to bring back that sense of ownership, the internet is a great\nplace for things like fanclubs and fan-feedback, though we're not seeing so\nmuch of that just yet - beyond myspace..\n\n> > The costs associated with writing and recording are a fraction\n> > of what they used to be, and the opportunities for the band to claw back\n> > the investment with merchandising and in the commercial space are\nmassive.\n> >\n> > > > \u2013 The Site \u2013\n> > > >\n> > > > With actualizing this vision in mind, I created\n> > > > www.strayform.com.

I don't like the idea for that reason, it's more\nof the same thing but with the convenience of lower risk by burdoning the\nfans with the setup/recording costs.  A lot of the news repotage talks of\n$50,000+ for recording fees, sounds to me like a studio somewhere is making\na good living out of it!\n\n> >\n> > I would suggest building into your plan somehow the \"beyond music\"\nstrategy\n> > of the Chinese, so artists using your site don't expect to make money\nfrom\n> > the fans for the music directly.
