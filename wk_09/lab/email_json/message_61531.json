The ED\nvisit can end in one of a variety of ways (Admit, discharge, transfer,\netc...) Initially, I have modeled the time to event  by fitting a survival\nmodel to  the time the outcome of interest and treat all other outcomes as\ncensoring. However I recently came across the cmprsk package in R which\nseems to be developed specifically for competing risks survival models. I\nhave been able to gather that the key issue in deciding whether to model\neach outcome separately or to use something like the cmprsk package is to\ndetermine whether or not the censoring is \"non-informative.\" I have read a\nup a little about informative vs. no-informative censoring, but remain\nconfused, is their a standard approach to determining whether or not\ncensoring is informative, can anyone suggest some good\n(approachable/non-technical) references on the subject?\n\nbest,\n\nSpencer\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
