Zometa is approved for treating bone mets.\nNovartis hopes to soon begin selling zoledronic acid as Reclast  for\nthe treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It's the exact same drug,\njust two different names.\n\nI'm curious as to whether anyone knows of any other similar examples.\n(I know that Wyeth has \"reformulated\" Effexor to sell under a different\nname for use as a hot flash treatment.)\n\nAlso, can anyone explain, or recommend someone who can comment on, the\nbenefits that pharmaceutical companies get (patent or exclusivity\nextensions or otherwise) when they remarket a drug with a new name or\nfor a new use?\n\nThanks,\nSue Rochman\nFreelance Medical/Health Writer\nsue.rochman@earthlink.net\n415-346-0414\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
