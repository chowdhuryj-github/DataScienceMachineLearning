Where did \"A B 4\" come from, and what does it mean for \"2 co-\nocurrences\" under doc number 1?  What is a co-occurrence? I see one\ninstance of \"1 A\", and two instances of \"1 B\".  How does that\ntranslate to \"2 co-ocurrences\" of \"A B\"?\n\nCan you explain your desired goal a little better?\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
