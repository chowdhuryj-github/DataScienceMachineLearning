I was wondering if it's possible to make a message appear on the console whenever a user loads the data. So the console would look like\n\n>data(mydata)\n\"Please do not use these data in any publication without permission of the authors\"\n>\n\nWould  this message be within the terms of GPL? \n\nLooking at the ?data page, it seems \"packageIQR\"  might be the way forward, but I couldn't find any further information on this.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nSimon Bond.\n\n\n      ___________________________________________________________ \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
