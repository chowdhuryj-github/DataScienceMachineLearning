One I hit last week had DNS\ndisabled completely (just doesn't respond on port 53 at all, and no\nother DNS server).  Other ones have completely broken ldap setups, or\nbroken time sync, or any other number of ways that admins have\ninvented to screw up AD.\n\nIt happens because windows clients keep working, so nobody notices\nwhen AD breaks, except the poor sod who has to come into the\nenterprise environment and install a Samba server. In many\nenvironments asking for a DC to be fixed properly is just impossible,\nso I want some way, any way, of making Samba still be able to work in\nthose environments.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
