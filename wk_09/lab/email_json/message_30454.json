In a levelplot for instance, the native units per cm of my x and\ny axes are different, and I need to know the aspect ratio so that I can\ncorrectly plot vectors.  I know how to set the aspect in a high-level\nlattice function but I can't quite figure out how to get it.  I would\nlike call to levelplot() without printing anything, get the aspect\nratio, use it to create my vector arrows, then call levelplot() again\nwith print() to create the final figure.\n\nScott Waichler\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory\nscott.waichler _at_ pnl.gov\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
