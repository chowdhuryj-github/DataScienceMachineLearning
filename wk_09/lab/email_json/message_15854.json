The usual configure rules\napply; don't assume you know what directory holds perl (it will be in\none of the PATH directories but those directories are not the same as on\nUnix/Linux systems).  Try to stick to standard perl features and not use\nany recently-added features.  We are on perl 5.8.0; not ancient but not\nall that new, either.\n\nThanks\nPG\n--\nPaul Green, Sr. Technical Consultant\nStratus Technologies, Inc., Maynard, MA 01754 USA\nTel: +1 (978) 461-7557, Fax: +1 (978) 461-3610, AIM: PaulGreen\n\n\n"}
