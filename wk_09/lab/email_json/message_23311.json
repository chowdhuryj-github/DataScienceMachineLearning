The latter can be crucial for utilities as they seek to make system improvements with new generation or power delivery projects. It\u2019s no secret that many infrastructure projects are delayed or stopped altogether due to public opposition. It is becoming clear that to successfully engage the public, utilities are moving beyond traditional approaches and employing a wide range of participation techniques. So, how can a utility build necessary infrastructure and improve relationships with stakeholders and regulators? What can the utility gain by engaging the public?\n\u00a0\nThis EUCI conference will provide a forum for utility executives, regulators, customers and experts in public participation to discuss how utilities and their affected communities can come together to identify infrastructure improvements that all stakeholders can support. Attendees will learn how utilities are able to obtain meaningful input and how different approaches are used in order to overcome objections, reach out to traditional adversaries and improve relationships with community leaders and regulators.\n\u00a0\nThe first session will be a comprehensive panel discussion among representatives from integrated utilities, transmission owners/operators, utility customers, regulators, alternative energy advocates and public involvement experts. This panel will address specific questions regarding the definitions of trust and transparency and how to create these attributes in the stakeholder involvement process. The panel will also speak to best practices from specific projects across the country and will conclude with a Q&A session from the audience.\n\u00a0\nThe remainder of the conference will take this discussion into more specific focus. Utilities will talk about their company\u2019s philosophy on public participation, their typical methodology, internal training and organizational responsibility. These presentations will also include case-specific examples of the public process for generation and power delivery projects and speak to the specific results, positive and negative, gained from the process.\n\u00a0\nWhat Attendees Will Learn:\n\u00a0\n\nHow to identify and engage key individuals in a balanced conversation that produces positive outcomes\n\nHow to develop trust among all participants\n\nWhat different stakeholders look for and expect in a meaningful process\n\nHow to collaborate with leaders in your community, including traditional \"opponents\"\n\nHow to generate recommendations and build public support\n\nHow to significantly improve relations with regulatory officials\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\u00a0\n\nUtility employees with regulatory and local affairs \nresponsibilities\n\nProject managers\n\nRegulators and regulatory staff\n\nPower consumer representatives\n\nCommunity groups\n\nNGO representatives\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\nClick on any title to download a conference brochure.
