Distribution is one such act. Copying without\ndsitribution is also such an act. Creating a derivative work is\nalso such an act. And for example in Europe, executing software\nis also such an act. \n\nFor most free and open source licenses, only acts that involve\ndistribution come with conditions. But that is a special case.\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
