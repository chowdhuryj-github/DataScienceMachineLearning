Two things in particular:\n\n1) I have longitudinal data and wish to allow for different repeated\nmeasures covariance parameter estimates for different groups (men and\nwomen), each covariance matrix having the same structure. In proc\nmixed this would be done by specifying group= in the REPEATED\nstatement. Is this simple to do in R? (I've tried form=~time|indv/sex\nfor example but this doesn't seem to do the job).\n\n2) I've read that other correlation structures can be specified. Does\nanyone have any examples of how toeplitz or (first-order)\nante-dependence structures can be specified?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nGareth\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
