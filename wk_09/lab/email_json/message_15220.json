The\nSamba 4 test system has a couple of advantages over the one currently\nin Samba 3:\n\n * Support for testing domain members (winbind could be tested)\n * Progress indication\n * Ability to run individual tests rather than the whole bunch\n\nHowever, it would be necessary to depend on perl in Samba 3 for 'make\ntest' to run. Is that a problem?\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niQCVAwUBRi8evQy0JeEGD2blAQIfowP+KqliSDiivcBxO6Xi7Vgiah0vQgW1BnLm\npHRHom8OdD32JxR8FL4mi3MGFDXIFkTuBVdWd6Ac78tGmrvXS9k57ftvLDvb13ge\naa26viG5qZKt2CO8mpTEpg+oYtKhE/B/FQmigYo8coUgwsiFszaSZ+ENqi6bvpdS\nKvESfzx/Fqs=\n=39Gk\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
