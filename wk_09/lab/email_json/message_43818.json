The package contains one function of the same name and it performs an exact rate ratio test for Poisson counts.  Unlike binom.test and fisher.test the p-values and confidence intervals are internally consistent. In other words, if the p-value implies that the null hypothesis should be rejected, then the confidence interval also implies that the null should be rejected. There is a vignette discussing this issue.\n\n\nMike\n\n\n******************************************************************\nMichael P.
