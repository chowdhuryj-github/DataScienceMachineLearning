It doesn't seem to \nbe running too bad for 256 mb of ram on a 1 gig processor. I haven't done a \nlot with it yet though because of a bad spare keyboard that has letter keys \nthat stick together. I think I will replace it with a KVM switch because I \nalso got my wireless keyboard that is fairly new broken trying to reset it, \nbecause I must've poked the recessed button wrong. I think now that it's \ninstalled things will work fairly well once I replace Festival with Dec Talk \nor something.\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"tony seth\" \nTo: \nSent: Thursday, April 12, 2007 9:51 PM\nSubject: Re: Thinkpad Saga Continues\n\n\n> Hi all:  Since we're on the subject of thinkpads, I've got a bit of a\n> poser too.
