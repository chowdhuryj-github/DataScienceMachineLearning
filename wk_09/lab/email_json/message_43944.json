It's called  \nvoice over, and for the most part, it works fairly well.\nIt has it's quirks, but what doesn't.\nAny OSX version 10.4 (that's tiger) or later will work with voice  \nover, so you're able to basically sit down and use *any* mac that is  \nrunning tiger.\nAnd, that's the main benefit here.\nYou buy the computer, the os comes with it, and you need spend  \nnothing extra to make it accessible to a blind user.\nThat more than anything else is why I'm so drawn to the macs, though  \nthe longer I use them, the  more I find to recomend them.\nI've had my current machine only about 6 months, but before that I  \nhad one since only a few months after osx tiger came out.  It came  \nout in April (end of april) and I bought my minimac in August.  That  \nwas nearly two years ago.\nThat mini went to my son, and I got another mini, and a macbook (the  \nmac laptop)\nThey're both nice machines.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
