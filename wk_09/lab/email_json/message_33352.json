Another idea is putting this in a script:\n/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\nservices ports go here\n/sbin/iptables -P INPUT DROP\nOnly apply that policy when you know that all your required ports are open; if not, you may find yourself locked out of your machine, and only console access can fix things again.\nIgor\nOn Sun, May 20, 2007 at 05:33:15PM -0400, Travis Siegel wrote:\n> If you turn off the various utilities in the inetd.conf file that you  \n> don't use, that can help too.\n> I.E. since you're using ssh, you won't need telnet and rlogin.   \n> Simply comment them out.
