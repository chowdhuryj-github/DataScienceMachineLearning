I have a\ndataset that has different years in it.  I am writing scripts using R\nand I would like to give a month a generic name and then use the generic\nname to do different analysis.  The reason for the generic name would be\nso that I only have to change one thing if I wanted to change the year.\nFor example.\nYear1 = 1999\ndatayear <- subset(dataset, Year = Year1)\nI would want  to subset for whatever year is in \"Year1\".  I am not sure\nif R does this but it would be great if it does.  Is there also anyway\nfor R to ask the user for the variable in the console without going into\nthe script and then use whatever the user puts in. Thanks for the help.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
