For example, I would view erotica, or trim the hairs in my pubic region to increase sensation during sex. Last week, with my wife's full knowledge and consent, I tried 25mg of Viagra with very satisfactory results. I told my wife that I had read that I should be very careful to be cuddly and loving when using Viagra. She just laughed and said, \"Don't worry about THAT; it just feels good having something that big inside me\".  I told her that I took half the recommended dose so that I wouldn't cause her discomfort.  She laughed again and blurted, \"I like it big and hard, I'd be crazy if I didn't. Don't ever worry about taking too much\".  I plan to put this stuff to the test, you can believe that.\nJohn Burke.\nY0u can find it here \n\n\n"}
