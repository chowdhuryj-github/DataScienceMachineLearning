Is there a /usr/bin/make? The path to make looks a \nbit wrong, presumably there shold be a leading slash / at the \nbeginning of the path;  \"/usr/bin/make\" as opposed to \"usr/bin/make\".\n\nJust a guess. Hopefully someone else will have more useful info for \nyou,\n\nGood luck,\nDp.\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
