In your example it is \nlikely that all women weren't followed completely, so simple incidences \nare not appropriate to compute because the denominator is not constant.\n\nFrank\n\n> \n>  \n> \n> ____________________________ \n> Nguyen Dinh Nguyen, \n> \n> Bone and Mineral Research Program \n> Garvan Institute of Medical Research \n> St Vincent's Hospital \n> 384 Victoria Street, Darlinghurst \n> Sydney, NSW 2010 \n> Australia \n> Tel; 61-2-9295 8274 \n> Fax: 61-2-9295 8241 \n> E-mail: n.nguyen@garvan.org.au \n> \n>  \n> \n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
