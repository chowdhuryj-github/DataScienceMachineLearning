You \nwere not to blame, as there were many circumstances that would reflect such scepticism to any reasonable being.For your sincere but unfruitful \nsacrifices, I pressurized the influential woman to concede some amount \nas COMPENSATION to you, for the resource that you imp lunged even the time and inconveniences.\n\nThe sum of USD 850,o00,00(Eight hundred and fifty thousand united\nstates dollars) was what she agreed to as your compensation value, and\nthe sum was made in draft but, because of my appointment in Ecuador and\ntoo, I could not get through to you since your number at any time indicated \"not in use\", I then handed it over to the Secretary of the Finance & Management Supports Initiatives, the consulting firm. Her name is MRS ROSE BROWN,EMAIL:rosedeskz1@yahoo.co.uk\n\nThe Secretary is very much informed by me about you and I instructed\nher to hand over the Draft to you as soon as you contact her. I gave\nher the CODE 707, which you have to mention for identification.Note\nthat at times I will be in the site and the Internet does not work \nthere. Onlywhen I am in the city.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nWilliams Mensah.\n\n"}
