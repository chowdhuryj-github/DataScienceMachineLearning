Today is Sony \n  Day!\nposted by Lessig on\u00a0http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003756.shtml\n\n\n\nI would like to ask everyone on the list to raise a cheer for yet another \nmultinational capitalist corporation's co-option of the free culture movement. \nTruly the\u00a0valorization of the hard-earned work of millions of unpaid, free \ncreators across the world should be celebrated for contributing yet again to the \nprofit margins of the world largest, richest and most powerful corporations. \nToday should be recognised as a breakthough for creative commons moving from a \ngrass-roots organisation committed to the creativity of everyone, to becoming \nthe trusted advisor and advocate to capital for implementing a new form of IP \npolicy that encourages 'sharing' ---\u00a0well, sharing as long as it is the \noutput of *us*, rather than anything that the multinational might produce (then \nclearly it is criminal and it is piracy).\u00a0\nHurrah \nfor SONY DAY!\n\n(One can only hope that one day, in the future, everyday will be named \nafter a giant multinational corporation!)\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________cc-community mailing \nlistcc-community@lists.ibiblio.orghttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n"}
