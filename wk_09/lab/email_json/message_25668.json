By default, Samba\ndefines it to be smb_panic(reason).\n\nTalloc's standalone build doesn't use DEBUG().\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niQCVAwUBRkDPpgy0JeEGD2blAQInVAQAlYdFJzIEZgAPgKDfwfI2D+QRl7s7T9uZ\nsHf5reDLF76qFE9wxm+FQGleN64CIh7iXwBQxp2OCDidomFaUDj6t5ZVr6MYHKnA\nGr1vlNG4K1g/tWR9BT6FzmnEISwfNJWOgdL4nPX8kG+U9UMa5fHHfpWt1JkFWk5T\nTufGWJFO2nM=\n=WdSZ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
