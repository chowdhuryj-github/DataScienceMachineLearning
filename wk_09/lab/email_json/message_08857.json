For those using linux who have an interest in seeing current\nweather conditions, I've written a bash script that gets the weather\ninfo from braille.wunderground.com, and displays the current conditions.\n\nI called the script \"conditions\".  you just put it in a directory in\nyour tath, run chmod 755 on the file, and you are rready to go.  You\nmust have the lynx browser installed in order to use this.\n\nYou just type:\n\nconditions Ames Iowa\n\nor some other city state combination, or a zip code, and it displays the\ncurrent conditions for that location.  I've included the script at the\nend of this message.  Have fun!\n\nGene Collins\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# conditions: a bash script to display current weather conditions.\n# Author: Alvin Gene Collins\n# Last modified: Wed Apr 18 09:03:34 CDT 2007.\n# usage: conditions Ames Iowa\n# or some other location or zip code.\n#\nif [ $# -eq 0 ];then export LOCATION=\"ames iowa\";else export LOCATION=\"$*\";fi\nlynx \"http://braille.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=`echo $LOCATION`\" -dump >/tmp/weather.tmp\ngrep -i \"observed\" /tmp/weather.tmp >/dev/null\nif [ $? -gt 0 ];then echo $LOCATION not found\\!;exit 1;fi\nlet A=`grep -i -n  \"observed\" /tmp/weather.tmp | cut -c 1-2`\ndeclare -i A\nA=A-1\ntail -n +$A /tmp/weather.tmp | head -n +8\ngrep -i \"sunrise\" /tmp/weather.tmp\ngrep -i \"sunset\" /tmp/weather.tmp\ngrep -i \"moon rise\" /tmp/weather.tmp\ngrep -i \"moon set\" /tmp/weather.tmp\nunset A\nunset X\nunset LOCATION\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
