The help for aggregate isn't helping me\nmuch (a new R user) to discover what value to give to FUN -'average' doesn't\nseem to exist, and 'sum' (whatever it is supposed to sum) gives an error\nsaying that arguments should have the same length-\n\nAny help will be much appreciated! \nSilvia.\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Averaging-across-rows---columns-tf3885900.html#a11014649\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
