We also cover the tragic crash of one of the Navy's Blue Angels, and we examine the energy-eating costs of computers.\n\n First integrated prom for\u00a0Georgia high school \nFor the first time, the faces of students at the Turner County High School prom were both white and black. Each year, in spite of integration, the school's white students had raised money for their own unofficial prom and black students did the same to throw their own separate party, an annual ritual that divided the southern Georgia peanut-farming county anew each spring. \n\n\n \nCNN Student News is a 10-minute, commercial-free news program that airs on CNN Headline News at 3:12 a.m. EST as well as on CNN.com/EDUCATION.
