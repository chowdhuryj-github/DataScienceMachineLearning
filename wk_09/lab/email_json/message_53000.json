For example, if I'm\nlooking for hex value 58 its fine, because I can just read a byte and\nsee if ($byte eq \"X\") since 58 is X in ASCII. What if I want to search\nfor ff or c6 or something which has no ASCII representation?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
