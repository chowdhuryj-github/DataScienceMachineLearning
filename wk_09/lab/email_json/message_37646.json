One question about the header I recently sent for final \napproval --\n\nThe project developers want to distribute a single set of source files \nunder both the licenses. They don't want to have to maintain two \ndifferent directories with two different versions of the same files with \nmerely the license headers differing.\n\nSo this means that the header must be appropriate for both the GPL and \nthe Professional License. I presume it is sufficient if it indicates \nthat the source file can be used under both licenses. For the GPL the \ndisclaimer of warranty is a must, A similar disclaimer is still \napplicable to their Professional License.\n\nSo how should I change the latest draft I sent so that the same source \nfiles can be distributed to both GPL and Professional License users?\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
