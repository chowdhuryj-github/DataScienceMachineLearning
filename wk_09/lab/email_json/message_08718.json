See Fabian Fagerholm's explanation.\nFor a strong copyleft licence like the GPL it's particularly\ntroublesome if people go around making minor edits: all of that code\nis licence-incompatible with all unedited-GPL code.  So the FSF have\nworked to prevent that by using the copyright on their licence text\nand I don't think that's unreasonable.\n\nThe status quo is quite fine and should be left as it is.\n\nIf this is forced to a GR we should have an option along these lines:\n\n  We note that many license texts are copyrighted works, licensed only\n  under meta-licenses which prohibit the creation of derivative\n  license texts.\n\n  We do not consider this a problem.\n\nIan.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
