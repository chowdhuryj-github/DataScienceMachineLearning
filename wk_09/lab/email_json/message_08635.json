Can/ should lambda be greater than 1 ?\n-- I think it's data dependent, but lambda can certainly be greater than one. \nFor many ridge regression problems you can choose lambda `objectively' by \ngeneralized cross validation (GCV). package `mgcv' provides a routine `magic' \nfor doing this (although it doesn't use the most efficient method if you only \nhave one lambda/ridge penalty). Of course this won't be appropriate if the \nridge penalty is only being used to stabilize the fit and you want the \nminimum lambda that e.g. makes X'X+ \\lambda I +ve definite. \n\n> I have conflicting (or what appears conflicting to me) sources that use\n> lambda >= 0, without any upper limit, but that makes the search space\n> infinite.. right ??\n>\n> So, perhaps my question is: is there an upper limit to lambda.\nI don't think so.\n> Does the  value of lambda convey something about my data ?\nDepends on the details of the model. For some models ridge penalties can be \nviewed as inverses of random effect covariance matrices, in which case lambda \nis related to the random effect variance. (see e.g. section 6.2.6. of 2006 \nbook referenced in ?gam from mgcv package).\n\nbest,\nSimon\n\n>\n> Thanks a lot,\n> Sikander\n>\n>\n> ---------------------------------\n>\n>\n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal,\n> self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n-- \n> Simon Wood, Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY UK\n> +44 1225 386603  www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~sw283\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
