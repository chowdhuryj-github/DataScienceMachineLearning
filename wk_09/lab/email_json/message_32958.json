If I can get some people together willing to record this way, I\nwill run some experiments along these lines.FYI, Antenna Alliance, a CC recording project out of Boston, MA and expanding to other cities is recording bands free of cost and promoting the music to college radio stations in exchange for releasing the music under CC licenses. (They are very heavily promoting\u00a0 CC BY and BY-SA and as a result, most, but not all of the music is under those licenses).\nThe site is still in the works, but you can find out more info at www.antalliance.org. \n\n"}
