Break the factor levels into 2 or 3 groups that have some rational \nconnection. Then fit the factor with a smaller number of levels. \nE.g., \"race\" might have levels \"white\", \"black\", \"asian\", \"pacific\", \n\"Spanish surname\", \"other\". Consider a change to \"white\", \"nonwhite\".\n\n================================================================\nRobert A. LaBudde, PhD, PAS, Dpl.
