The author of the authoritative \"A History of Greek Art\" \n(Cambridge University Press 1975), considered his magnum opus, inherited \nthe items from American archaeologist Lucy Talcott, the recording \nsecretary of Agora excavations in the 1930s and ?40s.\n\n    The artifacts were officially presented by one of Robertson's sons, \nStephen, at the ceremony, who stressed that he was bringing a gift by \nhis father to \"his beloved Greece\".

Martin Gayford\n\nBy Martin Gayford\n\nApril 17 (Bloomberg) -- Is there the merest hint of movement in the \nworld's most intractable restitution drama? That is, the issue of the \nElgin -- or, if you prefer, Parthenon -- Marbles, which has flared up at \nintervals since Lord Elgin removed them from the Acropolis at Athens in \nthe 19th century.\n\nNeil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, appeared to open the \ndoor to compromise in an interview with Bloomberg News, but only by a \nfraction of an inch. In principle, would he and the trustees consider a \nrequest from Athens to borrow the marbles?\n\n``There is no reason why any object in the BM -- if it is fit to travel \n-- shouldn't spend three months, six months somewhere else,'' he said. \n``So, in principle, absolutely yes. The difficulty at the moment which \nwould stand in the way of that is that the Greek government has \nformally, and recently, refused to acknowledge that the trustees are the \nowners of the objects. Therefore, in law the trustees could not possibly \nlend them.''\n\nIn addition, he said, ``the Greek government has never asked for a loan \nof the material from the British Museum. The issue has always been about \nthe permanent removal of all the Parthenon material in the BM collection \nto Athens.''\n\nMight that be the basis for some sort of compromise? Ownership, of \ncourse, is at the heart of the dispute. That question was raised as long \nago as 1816, when Elgin sold the sculptures to the British government. \nHis right of possession depends on interpretation of a letter of \npermission from an official of the Ottoman Empire, then ruling Greece.\n\nOriginal Documents\n\nThe original document and the Ottoman regime both disappeared many years \nago, and possession counts for a lot in law.\n\nAccording to a legal opinion quoted by the historian William St. Clair \nin his book, ``Lord Elgin and the Marbles'' (1998), Elgin's actions were \n``probably technically legal at the time,'' though threats and bribery \nmay have played a part. Any attempt by the Greek government ``to try to \nrecover the marbles in an international court would probably fail.''\n\nIt would be politically impossible for any Greek government to give way \non this point because the marbles have become a symbol of Hellenic \nnational identity. Professor Anthony Snodgrass, chair of the British \nCommittee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, said: ``This \noffer is a theoretical one in every sense. Mr. MacGregor knows that no \nGreek government could ever make a formal concession that the BM has \nlegal ownership.''\n\nLog-Jam\n\nOn the other hand, the British Museum understandably fears that if it \ngave way in this case, it, and other major museums, would receive an \navalanche of demands from around the world for the return of items \nacquired by fair, and less than fair, means in the colonial era.\n\nSo, stalemate? Maybe not. There was considerable speculation about a \npossible loan to coincide with the Athens Olympics in 2004. That came to \nnothing, partly because of the postponement of the opening of the new \nAcropolis Museum, which is now years behind schedule after a log-jam of \nlegal disputes about home demolitions, completion of archaeological digs \nand cost over-runs.\n\nThat gleaming institution is set for completion this summer and \ninauguration in the autumn. Meanwhile, the British Museum is becoming \nmore and more enthusiastic about temporary exhibitions. A blockbuster, \nthe Terracotta Army, opens in September. Brand new, much larger \nexhibition galleries are scheduled for 2012.\n\nSpectacular Show\n\nThere is scope for a spectacular and -- from the scholarly point of view \n-- exciting exhibition about the Parthenon sculptures. It is often \nassumed that all of them are in London. Actually, Elgin only extracted \nabout half from the temple.\n\nMost or the rest are still in Athens, with a couple of panels in the \nLouvre and fragments scattered all over the place. In some cases, \nfragments of the same figure are on opposite side of Europe. The \ncelebrated frieze is split in two.\n\nIf you could put it all back together, you'd have the blockbuster to end \nall blockbusters. Setting the question of ownership aside, that's a \nprospect to entice any museum director.\n\nPerhaps we should admit that the dispute about ownership is \nunresolvable. In the diplomatic world, the only way forward in such \ndifficult cases is to find a formula that each side can accept. Is there \none here? ``The very most that might be negotiable,'' Snodgrass said, \n``would be an agreement by the Greek government that the marbles were \nlegally acquired from Lord Elgin by Parliament, for the Museum.''\n\nIs that enough? The reward for an agreement -- especially for the \nart-loving public of the world -- would be enormous.\n\n(Martin Gayford is a critic for Bloomberg News.

St. Anthony \nhimself ? for its safe return.\n\nThe bronze in the sculpture is estimated to be worth at least $10,000.\n\nThe statue was erected 50 years ago to mark the tomb of Anthony \nStefaniuk. His widow, Anna Solohub, reported to be the first person to \ndie while visiting the Expo 67 world?s fair site 40 years ago, is also \nburied in the plot.\n\nBettie Klemchuck, a great-niece of the deceased couple, noticed the \nstatue was missing when she went to visit her mother?s grave Tuesday.\n\n?It?s pathetic to think someone would stoop so low to steal from a \ncemetery,? she said Thursday.\n\n?We?re a sick world. We really, really are.\n\n?The dead have gone to their rest. They should be resting. We?re praying \nto St. Anthony to get it back. He?s the saint you pray to when you lose \nthings. He?s been stolen. He?s lost.?\n\nThe gravesite apparently was vandalized between Palm Sunday, April 1, \nand Easter Sunday, April 8.\n\nWhoever took the statue had to have planned the theft carefully, \nKlemchuck said.\n\n?Obviously, someone was out for the money. One person alone couldn?t \ncarry the statue away.\n\n?To replace something like that these days would cost $30,000 or so. \nPeople can?t afford these things any more.?\n\nThe statue is one of more than a dozen bronze tombstone decorations that \nhave disappeared from the cemetery in the past five years.\n\nAmong the more prominent works that have vanished are a bust of \nPierre-Pascal Bourque by Quebec sculptor Louis-Philippe Hbert ? worth \nmore as a work of art than for the price of its bronze ? and a bust and \ndecorative bronze medallions from the grave of Alfred Laliberte.\n\nWhile the ?appropriate security measures? to prevent vandalism are \ntaken, cemetery general manager Yoland Tremblay said, it is impossible \nto monitor 55,500 tombstones 24 hours a day.\n\nExperience suggests not all gravesite decorations reported stolen are, \nin fact, stolen, he said.\n\n?All the bronze pieces in the cemetery belong to the families that \ncommissioned them,? he said.\n\n?We have had instances where one family member removed an ancestral \nbronze without telling other descendants. Sometimes pieces have been \ntaken away to be restored.\n\n?Of the dozen or so bronzes that have were reported stolen, four have \nbeen recovered or accounted for.?\n\nTremblay said the cemetery is not patrolled between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., \nbut because all its gates are locked after dark, it would be impossible \nto enter with a truck that thieves would need to remove big statues.\n\nThe theft of bronze statues and memorial plaques in and around Montreal \nhas become chronic in recent years.\n\nMore than two dozen metal historical markers have been ripped from sites \nin Old Montreal in the past two years.\n\nLast week, St. Joachim parish in Chateauguay reported that a Parks \nCanada bronze marker identifying the church as a national historic site \nhad been stolen in the first week of April.\n\nahustak@thegazette.canwest.com\n\nhttp://www.canada.com/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Sat, 21 Apr 2007 11:47:57 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Kashmiris robbed of their rich cultural heritage\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4629DDCD.7040400@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n\n    Kashmiris robbed of their rich cultural heritage\n\nSrinagar, April 19 (KMS): In occupied Kashmir, President of Jammu and \nKashmir Writers? Association (JKWA), Ghulam Nabi Khayal has said that \nKashmir has been robbed of its historical artefacts and cultural \nheritage in the name of security. \n\nKhayal was speaking in a program organized to observe World Heritage \nDay. JKWA President said, ?The centuries old historical arte-facts and \ncultural heritage excavated from different places in occupied Kashmir, \nlike Terracotta tiles of 2nd and 3rd centuries BC and 5000 years old \nfindings in Burzahama were looted and clandestinely transferred to \ndifferent parts of India in the name of security and chemical testing.? \n\nHe said that if serious steps were not taken to ensure the return of \nthis treasure, the days were not far away when Kashmir history would be \nlimited to myths alone. He said that the recently discovered fossils of \na mammoth elephant dating 1.5 lakh years ago were transferred to Jammu \nUniversity. He said that deliberate attempts were being made to destroy \nthe rich historical and cultural heritage of Kashmir. He added that 5000 \nyears? old history of Kashmir had got reduced only to documents. \n\nSpeaking on the occasion a well-known historian, Fida Muhammad Husnain \nsaid, ?Kashmir has a distorted history and the only reason for this \ndistortion is Indian occupation of Kashmir and we are living in an \noccupied land from ages and nobody can accept objectivity in these \ncircumstances.? Kashmir, Husnain said, has the historical evidences of \n1st century existence. ?Ours is the land where world scholars meeting \nwas held in the 1st century and the ruins of Parhaspora proves our \neighth century identity.? \n\nAsserting that Kashmir has always met the step motherly approach from \nIndian authorities, Muhammad Saleem Baig said, Gilgit manuscripts \ncontaining Kashmiri paintings were shifted from the Valley to Delhi in \n1948 and till date we don?t know the reason behind the transfer of the \nvaluable asset. He said, in 1895 Maharaja Hari Singh donated his Deewan \nKhana as museum for preservation of monuments but more than a century \nhas passed but no building was constructed for preservation of cultural \narts and historical treasures. \n\nMocking at puppet regime?s inability to preserve the history and culture \nof Kashmir Hassrat Gadda said that in 1995 CRPF troopers had stolen 35 \nart objects, which had not still gotten back. Gadda said that occupied \nKashmir continued to be ignored by the puppet authorities. ?The advent \nof Islam gave identity to Kashmir,? said columnist Zahid. The Vice \nChancellor Kashmir University, Prof Abdul Wahid Qureshi, Zarief Ahmad \nZarief, Dr Farooq Fayaz, Abdul Ahad Farhad, and Dr Mufti Muhammad \nMaqbool also spoke on the occasion. \n\nMeanwhile, leading Kashmiri English daily, Greater Kashmir (GK), on this \noccasion deplored the loss of valuable Kashmiris heritage from the \noccupied territory. The editorial said that India and its puppet regime \nhad failed to protect Kashmiris? millenniums old heritage. It commented, \n?There seems to be a deep conspiracy in neglecting the departments that \nhave been set up for preservation of heritage of the state and promotion \nof culture?, adding, ?today both the museum and the department of \narchives are in utter shambles.? \n\nThe editorial said that despite Kashmiri intellectuals, academicians, \nhistorians and media professionals? agitations and protests over the \ncriminal neglect, there is no consideration for culture preservation as \nsuch. The GK termed it shameful that the archaeological finds from \nBurzehama, Harwan, Kotabul and many other places have been shifted to \nCalcutta under the pretext that they were not safe in the occupied \nterritory.\n\nhttp://www.kmsnews.org\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 5\nDate: Sat, 21 Apr 2007 11:49:05 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Rogue diggers helping themselves to Macedonia's ancient\n\ttreasure\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4629DE11.5010700@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n  Rogue diggers helping themselves to Macedonia's ancient treasure\n\nThe Associated Press\nThursday, April 19, 2007\n\n*DEDELI, Macedonia:* \"Watch your step,\" goes a joke by archaeologists in \nMacedonia, \"or you might crack an ancient pot.\"\n\nIt could happen: Tiny Macedonia ? which is slightly larger than Belgium \nbut with a population of 2 million ? has some 6,000 registered \narchaeological sites.\n\nExperts warn that since the country gained independence from Yugoslavia \n16 years ago, its ancient heritage has become increasingly vulnerable to \nlooters who use sophisticated navigation and excavating equipment, \nleaving few sites unpillaged.\n\nThere is little to stop them.\n\nA third of the country's work force is jobless, and the government says \nit can only afford to hire one dedicated official to tackle the rampant \nillegal antiquities trade.\n\n\"This is nothing but an open invitation for illegal diggers to come here \nlooking for buried treasure,\" said 72-year-old Taip Tahiri, a retired \nteacher from the village of Dedeli, near Lake Dojran, about 180 \nkilometers (112 miles) south of the capital Skopje. His family home \nstands next to a rich Iron Age site with 98 excavated tombs.\n\n\"This site has been explored a lot ... but groups of illegal diggers are \nstill active in the area. Many of them made a fortune selling famous \nMacedonian bronzes to Greeks and other foreign buyers.\"\n\nIrena Kolistrkoska, head of Macedonia's archaeologists' association, \nwarned each year that scores of local and foreign diggers uncover \npriceless remnants from the Iron Age, as well as Greek, Thracian, Roman \nand Byzantine artifacts.\n\n\"There are two main reasons Macedonia is failing to seriously protect \nits cultural treasure: A lack of a strategy at a national level and the \nabsence of credible experts in the field,\" Kolistrkoska said.\n\nPasko Kuzman, director of the National Directorate for Protection of the \nCultural Heritage, said Iron Age archaeological sites in southeastern \nMacedonia have been extensively looted.\n\nPolice, he said, are already overstretched fighting organized crime, \nadding that fees offered by corrupt art collectors only encourage \nillegal excavations.\n\nMacedonia, a landlocked nation in southeastern Europe, has a rich and \nstoried past.\n\nThe country is part of the broader Macedonia region that includes parts \nof Greece and Bulgaria that became a major power in the ancient world \nunder Phillip II of Macedon, and his son Alexander the Great. Alexander \nwas one of the most successful military commanders in history, who built \na vast empire that stretched to India before his death in 323 B.C.\n\nModern Macedonia's claim to the region's ancient heritage has infuriated \nneighbor Greece, which refuses to recognize the former Yugoslav republic \nby its official name, and is still seeking arbitration of the dispute at \nthe United Nations.\n\nMacedonia's south, on major east-west trading routes, was successively \ndominated by different civilizations ? ancient Macedonian, Roman, \nByzantine and Ottoman.\n\n\"Macedonian bronze is trendy. It is world-famous because of the style \nand it can fetch very high prices on the black market,\" Kolistrkoska said.\n\n\"Even the smallest piece can be sold for ?1,000 (US$1,350).\"\n\nEast of Dedeli lies Isar-Marvinci, where villagers are usually on hand \nto guide visitors up to a hillside to hunt for ancient fragments.\n\n\"You can easily find Roman coins or ceramics. Just look a little \ncarefully. Every stone here is thousands of years old,\" said a villager, \nwho refused to give his name or even his initials, fearing reprisals \nfrom other guides.\n\nFifteen other local men have been arrested for illegal excavation and \ntrading in artifacts.\n\n\"As locals, we can find artifacts easily. But the state is not paying \nfor them. We are jobless and foreigners are often around with money,\" \nthe man said.\n\nKuzman said that during excavations at Isar-Marvinci between 1995 and \n2003, an estimated 2,500 artifacts were stolen.\n\n\"No one knows how many important national treasures have been smuggled \nout of the country, but it's clear the police don't yet have the means \nto stop it,\" he said.\n\nWhile illegal digs are impossible to stop, Kuzman takes a long-term view \nand argues much of Macedonia's looted treasure can still eventually be \ntracked down abroad and returned.\n\n\"Every inch of this soil is so rich that many discoveries are still \nawaiting us,\" he said. \"One of my dreams ... is to bring back to \nMacedonia a bronze bowl with a beautiful relief, which was recently \ntraced to New York.\"\n\nhttp://www.iht.com/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 6\nDate: Sat, 21 Apr 2007 11:49:34 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Restituted Nazi paintings sold in NY\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4629DE2E.8020707@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n\n  Restituted Nazi paintings sold in NY\n\nA collection of more than 30 old masters prints, looted from a Dutch \ndealer by the Nazis during World War II and returned to his heirs last \nyear, has fetched almost $US10 million at auction.\n\nThe 31 lots sold for a total of $US9.7 million, Christie's auction house \nsays.\n\nA river landscape by Salomon van Ruysdael was the top-selling lot, \nselling for $US2.2 million.\n\nThe prints were part of a collection of 200 artworks looted by the Nazis \nin 1940 and restituted to Marei von Saher, the daughter-in-law of Jewish \nart dealer Jacques Goudstikker, by the Dutch Government last year.\n\nOther works from the collection - which features Dutch old masters from \nthe 15th to 19th centuries, as well as works from 16th century Germany \nand 18th century France - are to go on sale in London in July and \nAmsterdam in November.\n\n\"The Dutch Government's return of these pictures was a historic event \nfor us and for all families whose possessions were stolen during the \nHolocaust era,\" Ms Von Saher said in a statement.\n\nShe says she was pleased with the sale.\n\n\"It was also a milestone in my family's mission to restore the legacy of \nJacques Goudstikker and to recover the property that was stolen from his \ngallery,\" she said.\n\nMarc Porter from Christie's described the collection as of \"exceptional \nhistorical importance,\" while director Nicholas Hall said it was \n\"arguably the most important collection of old master pictures ever \nrestituted.\"\n\nThe paintings were looted when Nazi forces invaded the Netherlands in 1940.\n\nGoudstikker fled the country with his wife and son and was forced to \nabandon his business and 1,400 works of art.\n\nBut he took with him a black notebook that recorded details of over \n1,000 of his pictures and proved essential in the search for his lost \nworks.\n\nWhile the Goudstikkers eventually managed to escape to the United \nStates, Goudstikker died on the journey.\n\nAccording to Christie's, Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering was among \nthe officers who looted Goudstikker's gallery, taking some works back to \nGermany.\n\nAnd while some 280 paintings from the original collection were returned \nafter the war, Dutch authorities held on to the prints and incorporated \nthem into the Dutch national collection.\n\nThe heirs to the collection began an eight-year legal battle to win back \nthe works in 1998.\n\nMs Von Saher remains committed to tracking down other works that were \nlooted from the original collection and are believed to be spread around \nthe world.\n\nArt recovery specialist Clemens Toussaint is among those helping Ms Von \nSaher locate missing parts of the collection.\n\n\"This is perhaps the most comprehensive research project ever undertaken \nto track down a single-owner art collection looted by the Nazis and it \nis our goal to find every single work,\" he said.\n\nhttp://www.abc.net.au\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 7\nDate: Sat, 21 Apr 2007 11:50:14 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Museum official faces art theft charges\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4629DE56.4060007@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nMuseum official faces art theft charges\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, April 19 (UPI) -- A Texas art museum executive and his \nwife face accusations that they attempted to snatch paintings from an \nart festival.\n\nPolice in Austin, Texas, arrested Nathan Sheppard, 37, and his wife \nAlexandra, 33, Sunday.
