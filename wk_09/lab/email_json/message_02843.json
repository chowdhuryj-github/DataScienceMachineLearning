The cdf of an exponential distribution\nwith rate = 0.5 evaluated at x = 50 is very close to 1.  If you want\nto find out exactly how close you could use\n\npexp(50, rate = 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\nwhich gives an answer on the order of 10^(-11).\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
