I'm in the process of (slowly, and\neventually) converting all the todo items in the perl source across to\nRT tickets.  This has the dual purpose of us checking corners of the\ncode which might be a bit dusty and cleaning the code up a bit.  If we\ndon't need the comment, we can just delete it and resolve the ticket.\n\nThanks for helping out by looking into the comment!  :-)\n\nPaul\n\n"}
