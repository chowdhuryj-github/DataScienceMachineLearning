Thank you.\n\nIf you installed the module through your system's package manager then\nuninstall it the same way.  If you installed it though CPAN, well, the\nmost complete way is to uninstall Perl, delete the install directory,\nreinstall Perl and all of the modules you want to keep.  CPANPLUS\nseems to offer an uninstall option, but I have heard there are\ncomplaints that it is not complete and may break other modules.\n\nWhy do you uninstall a module in the first place?  This is something I\nhave never understood.  I have tons of modules installed and the\neverything in @INC (baring the current directory) takes up less than\n50 megs, so it can't be space issues.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
