Please give us \nmore information about why a continuous variable should be dichotomized, \nand read\n\n@Article{roy06dic,\n   author = \t\t {Royston, Patrick and Altman, Spielas G. and\nSauerbrei, Willi},\n   title = \t\t {Dichotomizing continuous predictors in multiple\nregression: a bad idea},\n   journal = \t Stat in Med,\n   year = \t\t 2006,\n   volume =\t\t 25,\n   pages =\t\t {127-141},\n   annote =\t\t {continuous\ncovariates;dichotomization;categorization;regression;efficiency;clinical\nresearch;residual confounding;destruction of statistical inference\nwhen cutpoints are chosen using the response variable;varying effect\nestimates from change in cutpoints;difficult to interpret effects\nwhen dichotomize;nice plot showing effect of categorization;PBC data}\n}\n\nFrank\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
