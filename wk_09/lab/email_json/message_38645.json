I'll put it in.\n\nYou got my followup mail right (in reply to Volker and you)?\nI like not changing the default behavior, but it is probably\nless confusing (IMO) to just force the winbindd_rpc methods\nthan to tweak the flags in the winbindd_domain struct.  I believe\nthat was Volker's preference as well but you can double check\nwith him.\n\n> Is the parameter name ok? Better as a non-parametric?\n\nI prefer the parametric in this case (I think).\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXNgfIR7qMdg1EfYRAu2HAKDy6r9/kImWIF3bkuPzWqEuoU9whQCeKAi8\nygl3xn4eFbxbv+8NisNwEMc=\n=rNdk\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
