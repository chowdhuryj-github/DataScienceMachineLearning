EIDE drives take \nan 80, and not 40-wire ribbon cable.  the red or marked wire is wire #1 \nand usually is closest to the power connector on the drive.  Wire #1 \nshould be clearly marked on the motherboard or HDD controller card.  You \nmay be trying to connect an IDE component to an EIDE component or \nvice-versa.
