''If the price of the original heart drug cannot be reduced\nby more than this, any further negotiations may not be necessary. We\nwill buy the generic version to treat patients instead,'' said Public\nHealth Minister Mongkol na Songkhla yesterday.\n\nThailand issued compulsory licences to bypass patents on the anti-Aids\ndrug Efavirenz last November, followed by licences for Kaletra and then\nthe heart medicine Plavix in January.\n\nNegotiations to bring down drug prices have been taking place since late\nMarch between the government and the pharmaceutical giants Merck, Abbott\nLaboratories and Sanofi-Aventis, the patent holders of the drugs.\nHowever, no agreement has been reached.\n\nThe government is asking the firms to lower the drug prices to a maximum\nof 5% above the prices of the generic versions of the medicines.\n\nBut Sanofi-Aventis is standing by its price of 27 baht a tablet for\npatients receiving treatment under the Social Security Office and\nuniversal healthcare scheme.\n\nThe firm also demanded the compulsory licence for Plavix be revoked.\n\nDr Mongkol, who was attending a meeting in Geneva, said the ministry is\ngoing to import a second-line heart drug from a generic maker in India\nnext month due to the urgent need for the medicine among Thai patients.\n\nThailand is currently only able to produce first-line heart medications.\n\nThe second-line heart drug produced by the Indian drug maker costs only\nabout three baht per tablet and is still under the registration process\nwith the Food and Drug Administration, he said.\n\nDr Mongkol said he was also working on cutting the price of cancer drugs\nto about 20 times below those of original versions via compulsory\nlicensing.\n\nAccording to a source at the National Health Security Office (NHSO), the\nleukaemia drug Imatinib is among the list of cancer drugs being targeted\nfor compulsory licensing. The medicine is not yet available under the\nuniversal healthcare scheme due to its high cost. Cancer patients have\nto spend up to 4,000 baht a day on the medication.\n\nThe government spent more than 1.2 billion baht last year on about\n50,000 cancer patients receiving treatment through the universal\nhealthcare scheme run by the NHSO.\n\nCancer is the among the most likely causes of death among Thais, along\nwith accidents, HIV/Aids, heart disease and natural causes.\n\nThe Government Pharmaceutical Organisation has begun importing the\ngeneric version of Efavirenz from a drug maker in India and plans to buy\nPlavix and also Aluvia, the heat-stable version of Kaletra, next month\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
