The deal had some\nunusual provisions, such as giving Novartis right of first-refusal to\nlicensable discoveries, even some not funded with Novartis monies.\nThe deal has since expired, and last I looked (despite the presence of\ntorture-lover John Yoo), UCal Berkeley is still functioning.\n\nTemple University Press has just released a book on the deal titled\n\"Universities in the Age of Corporate Science: the UC Berkeley-Novartis\nControversy\", by Alan Rudy et al.  The book received a good review in\nthe\n12 April 2007 issue of Nature.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nJames Packard Love\nKnowledge Ecology International\nmailto:james.love@keionline.org\ntel. +1.202.332.2670 / mobile+1.202.361.3040\n\n\"If everyone thinks the same: No one thinks.\"  Bill Walton\"\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
