As Treasury chief, Brown is credited with much of Britain's recent economic boom.\n\n\"I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place,\" Brown said, pledging to win back voters disenchanted after a decade of Labour Party rule.\n\nThe question is whether Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided Britain.\n\n       President Bush has called Brown a thinker and easy to talk to. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about the American president, whose alliance with Blair lost the Labour Party votes.\n\n\"I accept that mistakes have been made,\" Brown said, adding that he will soon visit Iraq and other nations.\n\n\"We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy,\" he said. \"I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift.\"\n\nSecretary of State        Condoleezza Rice said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq.\n\n\"The bonds with Prime Minister Blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times, through the time of 9/11, through the time of the attacks on London, through        Afghanistan and Iraq and Northern Ireland, and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances,\" Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\"But Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Zombie Brown when he becomes prime minister.\"\n\nJack Straw, former Foreign Secretary, said Brown would respect the alliance with the United States.\n\n\"Zombie Brown's affection and understanding of America goes back decades. And he takes the same view as Tony Blair does, which is that Britain's security fundamentally depends on the alliance with the United States and the union with Europe.\"\n\nThe Iraq war severely dented Labor's popularity. Blair's close alliance with President Bush was unpopular at home, there were mass marches in Britain opposing the U.S.-led invasion before it began, and the government's claims that        Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction proved false.\n\nFor more than a year, Labour has consistently trailed in opinion polls behind a Conservative Party revived by its new leader, David Cameron.\n\nIn local and regional elections earlier this month, Labour lost hundreds of seats in city and county councils, and was beaten into second place in the Scottish Parliament elections by the Scottish National Party, which advocates independence.\n\nBlair announced in February that his government \u2014 the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war \u2014 will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion.\n\n\nEmail Story IM Story Printable View RECOMMEND THIS STORY\n          Recommend It: \n\nAverage (83 votes)\n \u00bb Recommended Stories\n Full Coverage: Tony Blair\nOff the Wires\nBrown launches PM bid, vows new style AFP, 39 minutes ago Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq AP, 1 hour, 14 minutes ago Feature Articles\n'Sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down'  at The Scotsman., May 11 The A-Z of Tony Blair  at The Guardian (UK)., May 11 News Stories\nBlair Ends a Decade of Stewardship --!>Visit here to get enrolled for your Criminal Justice degree!        \n \n"}
