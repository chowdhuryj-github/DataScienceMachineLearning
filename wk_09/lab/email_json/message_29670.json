Let us know if you'd like a copy sent\nto you.\n\nIn this May/June edition we lead on the Access fires in Thailand and India\nand put them in the context of the larger concerns about a system that is\nfailing to deliver new and affordable medicines for people in need in the\ndeveloping world.\n\nAt the WHA, attention is fixed on the progress of the IGWG negotiations\naimed at developing a more equitable global model of R&D. Supporters are\ncalling for TB to be used as a pilot model to help push the IGWG process\nfoward. That's why you'll find a two-page spread on TB in this edition,\ndrawing on the findings of the symposium held by MSF in New York in\nJanuary.\n\nAnd at the G8 summit in Germany, the leaders are expected to issue a final\nstatement  backing intellectual property rights as the best way forward for\npromoting innovation and growth.  We beg to differ and profile three\nalternative models of R&D which we believe could offer a better chance of\ndelivering medicines to those most in need.\n\n\nLaura McCullagh\nCommunications Officer\n Medecins Sans Frontieres\n Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines\n Tel:+41 22 849 89 00\n E-mail: Laura.McCullagh@geneva.msf.org\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
