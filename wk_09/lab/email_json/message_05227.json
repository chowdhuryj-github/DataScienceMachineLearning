Or do they have some  \nsort of policy about unicity of files in packages? Besides that, if  \nCPAN.pm cached the MANIFESTs of modules installed by it (which if it  \ndoesn't, I guess it would be a matter of programming), wouldn't that  \nsuffice to offer uninstalling?\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
