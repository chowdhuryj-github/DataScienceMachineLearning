The way the function\nworks is:\n\nmy $foo = 5;\n$foo = modify_variable($foo);\nprint \"$foo\\n\"; #prints \"6\\n\"\n\n> Then why are you doing this\n> \n> $_ = modify_variable($_)\n> \n> in all of your examples?\n> snip\n> > Agree on that, but given other details that I didn't communicate, it is\n> > not quite possible (this is actually a pl/perlu function in postgresql,\n> > the variables I am working on are passed to the function, and their type\n> > is limited by the function definition, so unless I create a composite\n> > type I can't pass them as an array directly).\n> snip\n> \n> Perhaps you should describe the full situation then.
