If I get the abstract done in\ntime, there will be a presentation at the R conference about a next\nrelease of the survival package which folds in coxme, improvements in coxme,\nand suggestion of depreciated status for the frailty() function.  There are\ndata sets where frailty() gets lost in searching for the optimum and coxme\ndoes not.\n\n 2. McGilchrist suggested an \"REML\" estimator for Cox models with a Gaussian\nfrailty; but it was motivated by analogy with linear models and not by\na direct EM argument.  Later work by Cortinas (PhD thesis, 2004) showed cases\nwhere it performed more poorly than the ML estimate, which does have a formal\nderivation due to Ripatti and Palmgren.  The coxme function uses the ML,\nthe frailty(, dist='gauss') the proposed 'reml' estimate.  \\\n\n I don't have answers for Karim's further questions about existence of a\nroutine for the positive stable distribution, or comparisons to the nltm()\nor frailtypack routines.\n\n\tTerry Therneau\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
