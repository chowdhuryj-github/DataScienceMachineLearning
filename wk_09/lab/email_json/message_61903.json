When I first added the repsitory line to/etc/apt/sources.list synaptic complained that it was a malformed line.  Ifixed thisby adding \"main\" to end of the entry making it:\n deb http://my.favorite.cran.mirror/bin/linux/ubuntu feisty main\nHowever after this it still complains that it can't find \"packages.gz\"\nIt appears to be looking in http://my.favorite.cran.mirror/bin/linux/ubuntu/distsfeistywhich isn't the directory structure of the cran repository, but I can see anyway to modify this behaviour.  Every other Ubuntu repositoyI have looked at contains the dists directory.\nAny suggestions for modifying this behaviour are gratefully recieved.Many thanks\nMike Smith\n\n\"Stefan Gro\u00dfe\" wrote:> >>I'm using Ubuntu dapper, which only have R of Version 2.2.1.> >>Would anybody tell me how to install the latest version of R with > > > from the CRAN Ubuntu readme- works for synaptic as well:> > * UBUNTU> > R packages for Ubuntu on i386 are available.
