When you're done using it, you can simply delete the\ndirectory and its contents.\n\nIf you didn't install it into a special directory, the most effective\nway is to delete everything in that directory, then reinstall the\nmodules you want. And perl too, if necessary.\n\nThen again, the most effective technique of all may be simply to\ndeclare the module to be uninstalled in a loud, firm voice, as often\nas necessary. It still takes up space on disk, of course, but if\nyou're already ignoring any bug reports you're seeing about the\nmodule, you shouldn't notice any additional problems.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
