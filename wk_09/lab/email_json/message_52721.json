I am hoping that someone \nwill be able to point me in the right direction and/or suggest a \ntechnique/package/reference that will help me with the following.\n\nI have:\n\nSome input variables (integers, real)\nSome output variables (integers, real)\n\nand I want to find out which between the two correlate best - i.e. the \nsalient features.
