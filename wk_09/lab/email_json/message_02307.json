Thanks in advance.\n\nYour examples worked for me with R 2.5.0 beta and knnflex 1.1.\n\nYou haven't followed the advice in the posting guide, and we have no idea \nwhat version of R and what of knnflex this is, nor if there is any other \npackages attached.  (I did not find a function 'as.vector.dist' \nanywhere.)\n\n-- \nBrian D.
