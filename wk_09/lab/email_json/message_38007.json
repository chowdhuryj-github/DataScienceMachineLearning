There's a\ndirty little secret in the broadband industry: Internet Service Providers\n(ISPs) [0]don't have the capacity to deliver the bandwidth that they\nclaim to offer. One way ISPs attempt to conceal this problem is to place\na cap of say 1GB per-month per user, something which is common in the UK\nfor many of the lower-cost broadband packages on the market. Considering\nthat a mere three hours viewing of Joost (the new online video service\nfrom the founders of Skype) would all but use up this monthly allowance,\nit's clear that lots of Internet users aren't invited to the party. But\nwhat about those who (like me) pay more for 'unlimited' broadband access?\nThere shouldn't be a problem, right?

In July 1941 with World War II looming, a small group of army\nofficers met to consider a secret plan to provide a permanent home for\nWar Department headquarters containing 4 million square feet of office\nspace and housing 40,000 people. The building that Brig. Gen. Brehon\nBurke Somervell, head of the Army's Construction Division, wanted to\nbuild was too large to fit within the confines of Washington DC and would\nhave to be located across the Potomac River in Arlington. \"We want\n500,000 square feet ready in six months, and the whole thing ready in a\nyear,\" the general said adding that he wanted a design on his desk by\nMonday morning. The easiest solution, a tall building, was out because of\npre-war restrictions on steel usage and the desire not to ruin\nWashington's skyline. The tract selected had a [2]asymmetrical pentagon\nshape bound on five sides by roads or other divisions so the building was\ndesigned to conform to the tract of land. Then with objections that the\nnew building would block views from Arlington National Cemetery, the\nlocation was moved almost one-half mile south. The building would no\nlonger be constructed on the five-sided Arlington Farm site yet the team\ncontinued with plans for a pentagon at the new location. In the rush to\ncomplete the project, there was simply no time to change the design.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/28/1334258\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://peacecorpsonline.org/\n    1. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/23/AR2007052301296.html\n    2. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2007/05/24/GR2007052400817.gif\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Eben Moglen \u2014 GPLv3 Not About MS and Novell                  |\n|   from the having-to-restate-the-obvious dept.                     |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 28, @13:02 (Software)      |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/28/1637205          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nLinux.com's Joe Barr was recently able to sit down with Professor Eben\nMoglen at the San Diego Red Hat Summit and discuss the GPLv3 and what it\nmeans [0]beyond the Microsoft/Novell deal on video. \"Professor Moglen\nexplains briefly about GPLv3's work on globalization of the software\nlicense, preventing harm to others by members of the community, and the\nmost contentious in earlier drafts, DRM.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/28/1637205\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/05/17/1616214\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| China Crafts Cyberweapons                                          |\n|   from the virtual-arms-race dept.                                 |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 28, @15:11 (Security)      |\n|   http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/28/1835250           |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nMitmWatcher writes to mention that a recent report by the Department of\nDefense revealed that China is continuing to [0]build up their\ncyberwarfare units and develop viruses. \"'The PLA has established\ninformation warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer\nsystems and networks,' the annual DOD report on China's military warned.\nAt the same, Chinese armed forces are developing ways to protect its own\nsystems from an enemy attack, it said, echoing similar warnings made in\nprevious years.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/28/1835250\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132284-pg,1/article.html(News)\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Cell Phones Disable Keys for High-End Cars                         |\n|   from the fun-toys-to-exploit dept.                               |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 28, @16:53 (Communications)|\n|   http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/28/1927213     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]Geoffrey.landis writes \"Turns out if you have a top-end Nissan car,\nyour [1]cellphone may erase your car key.
