What makes\none distro different from another is the choice of which \nprograms are included, how the file system hierarchy is\nlaid out, how the init scripts work, how the install and \nand configuration works. \n\nBSD is a similar situation but the design of the kernel is\nexteremely different, how device drivers are included is\nalso very different, but its based on the same set of GNU\ntools, similar toolchain, similar utilities etc. The difference\nbetween the BSD variants is similar to the difference \nbetween linux distros. People split off from the original\nberkeley unix and started making different distros and \nfocusing on different areas, with somewhat different \nphilosophies as to how things should be done.\n\nRegarding security, BSD is probably more secure only\nbecause there is less of it around, therefore less reason\nfor hackers to attack it, same as mac. \n\nCan speakup work with BSD, no. The source code \npatches the kernel, and the kernels are completely \ndifferent. Something exactly like speakup could be \nwritten for BSD but I think most of the code would \nnot be portable at all.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
