I don't know if it\nprovides all the features that Bacula requires; in my software it was\neasy to add a configure-time choice between the two.  Since gnutls is\nlicensed under LGPLv2.1+ and GPLv2+ (varying by component), there\nshould be no license concerns when using it with other GPLed code.\n\nHaving already put my foot in this mess, I will try that out with the\ngoal of producing patches this weekend, unless Kern, John or someone\nelse prefers to investigate for themselves.  I may miss some run-time\ncases (I don't currently use Bacula), but hopefully the input is\nuseful to Kern and to Debian.\n\nFurther discussion of that is a bit off-topic for -legal; I can post\nquestions to bacula-devel and patches to SourceForge.  John, should I\npost the patches somewhere for your (or other maintainers') benefit?\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
