The example codes below:\n\n{\n\tpackage Animal;\n\tsub speak{\n\t\tmy $class = shift;\n\t\tprint \"a $class goes \", $class->sound, \"!\\n\";\n\t}\n}\n\n{\n\tpackage Horse;\n\t@ISA = qw(Animal);\n\tsub sound{\n\t\t\"neigh\";\n\t}\n}\n\nHorse->speak;\n\nI understand that the class Horse would start looking for the method\nspeak in the Horse package and then move upto Animal. Once the method\nspeak is found in Animal, perl invokes the method\nAnimal::speak(\"Horse\") and moves back to Horse for the sound method.\n\nWhat I'm having trouble understanding is how $class is passed the\nargument \"Horse\" when I don't explicitly pass Horse as a parameter to\nspeak.\n\nThanks, Dean\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
