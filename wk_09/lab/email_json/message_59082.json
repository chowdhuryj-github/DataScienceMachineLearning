This is very serious business. That means\nmy machine is actually doing the scanning. Nobody with any brains\ndoes hacking from their own machine, they log in five, ten or more\nmachines deep. The topic of detecting breaches is a very deep one,\nand if I was to have any ports pemanently open I'd look into\nsoftware that monitors changes to files like tripwire or similar. Also\nset up firewall with logging rules.\n\nI have been hacked more than once, trust me it is not fun. Hackers\nlook for easy entry. It's just like home security, they say you should\nhave bars on your basement windows not because they are\nunbreachable but because they are deterrent, they make the\ncriminals go to someone else's home without bars. Same is true for\nnetwork security, don't make it easy for them. If you ask any security\nguru they will say there is no such thing as guaranteed network security.\nIt is a trade off of risk versus cost, where cost is the effort expended in\nsecuring your system. The only way to be truly secure is too be off the\nnet. Not viable for most but having ports open when you don't to is an\ninvitation. If you do that, get on security alert lists and follow the known\nexploits, update your network software (dns, ftp, etc) as soon as new\nversions are created to fix exploit bugs.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
