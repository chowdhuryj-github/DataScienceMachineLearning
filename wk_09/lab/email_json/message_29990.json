[King Solomon]\n\nThough intelligence is powerless to modify character, it is a dab hand at finding euphemisms for its weaknesses.\n\nI hope with all my heart there will be painting in heaven.\n\nJealousy is love bed of burning snarl.\n\nWoman's first duty in life is to her dressmaker. What the second duty is no one has yet discovered.\n\nOld friends are best. King James used to call for his old shoes they were easiest for his feet.\n\nFor neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy, the only evil that walks invisible, except to God alone.\n\nBetween two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.\n\nBig results require big ambitions.\n\nFailure is not the worst thing in the world -- the very worst is not to try\n\nCommunication is not only the essence of being human, but also a vital property of life.\n\nAll evils are equal when they are extreme.\n\n\n"}
