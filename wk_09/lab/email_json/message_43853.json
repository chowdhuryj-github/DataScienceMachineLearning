I've got the NetInst stuff from people.debian.org/~shane, but\ndon't know if kernel 2.6.18 is the latest version in Testing.  I'm not sure\nif I want to run a mixed distribution: is this common with Debian?\n>     I know that none of the official Deb kernels contain Speakup.  Would I\nneed to roll my own if I wanted to upgrade to Testing?\n> Thanks,\n> Zack.\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
