Release the music under a Free (and in my book, copyleft) license. \nThis is certainly a benefit to the public.\n>\n> > > Historically, bundled into the\n> > > cost of each CD or book is the cost of production and\n> > > distribution.

(Actually, I have been thinking recently that \nit might be a nice twist to go back to the \"album format\" for delivery of \nCDs. Basically, album size, materials, posters, lyrics, etc. with a CD inside \ninstead of vinyl. Is it clear what I mean here?)\n\n> The costs associated with writing and recording are a fraction \n> of what they used to be, and the opportunities for the band to claw back\n> the investment with merchandising and in the commercial space are massive.\n>\n> > > \u2013 The Site \u2013\n> > >\n> > > With actualizing this vision in mind, I created\n> > > www.strayform.com.

Unless there is a Free license involved, what is to stop a sell out in \na few years to the majors?

If I can get some people together willing to record this way, I \nwill run some experiments along these lines.\n>\n> My 2p for what it's worth :)\n>\n> Best of luck with the venture Brandt! :D\n>\n> Kevin\n>\n\nall the best,\n\ndrew\n-- \n(da idea man)\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
