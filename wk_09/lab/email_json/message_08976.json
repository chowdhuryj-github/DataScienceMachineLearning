I do feel that the problems you have\nrightly listed occur infrequently and that often I only care about two\ngroups.  Rank tests generally are good at relatives, not absolutes.  We\nhave an efficient test (Wilcoxon) for relative shift but for estimating\nan absolute one-sample quantity (e.g., median) the nonparametric\nestimator is not very efficient.  Ironically there is an exact\nnonparametric confidence interval for the median (unrelated to Wilcoxon)\nbut none exists for the mean.\n\nCheers,\nFrank\n--\nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
