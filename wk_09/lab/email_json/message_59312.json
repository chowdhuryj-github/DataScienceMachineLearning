Up to I know, I use PCA (or PCoA) for condense the great part of vaciance on the firsts axis, and CA (or DCA) when I would like to identify the structure/composition of data inside a matrix. \n\nBut I have seem that nowadays many ecologists are using NMDS to dimension reduction on data matrices, and interpret the axis (1, 2 etc) like they do on CA or DCA. My question is if I can use the axis of NMDS output on regression like I can do when with PCA, PCoA, CA and/or DCA axis. \n\nWhat is the \"stress\" effect on the usage of NMDS axis on regression?\n\nAnother question is if are there a good PDF text about MDS and NMDS available on the web. \n\nI know that on \"vegan\" library (Thanks Oksanen!!) there are same fuctions which deal with MDS, metaMDS. Are there other packages that also works with MDS/NMDS/isoMDS on R? What are the similarity/difference on them?\n\nAll comments are very welcome!\n\nKind regards,\n\nMiltinho\nBrazil\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttp://yahoo.com.br/oqueeuganhocomisso \n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
