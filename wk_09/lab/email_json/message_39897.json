It is more of a coding standards test\nanyway, and I was wondering if it would be ok if I moved it from the\ndoc tests into the coding standards tests.  This would also allow me\nto un-skip the test, removing the extra output skipping the test\ngenerates in 'make test' output, and allowing people to run the test\nmanually as opposed to part of the main test suite.  Is this ok?  If\nnoone complains I'll make the change in the next couple of days.\n\nPaul\n\n"}
