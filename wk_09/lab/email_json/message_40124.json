To get it, do the following:\n\necho app-accessibility/speechd-up >> /etc/portage/package.keywords\nemerge speechd-up\n\nThen add speechd-up to the default runlevel.\n\nPlease report bugs to http://bugs.gentoo.org.\n\nThanks,\n\n- -- \nWilliam Hubbs\ngentoo accessibility team lead\nwilliamh@gentoo.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.7 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGX5LfblQW9DDEZTgRAqWvAJ4h4Ctwi8oe+rvnBQl6Sep4SPetnQCdGPF3\n0RLlnpsphUREyu81Qwzv/TY=\n=Fstt\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
