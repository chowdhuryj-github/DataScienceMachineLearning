Hi \n      everyone, We'll be broadcasting another hour-long special edition \n      of the CBS Evening News tonight from the campus of Virginia \n      Tech, where President Bush and the first lady today joined students, \n      faculty and the extended university community in mourning the dozens who \n      died in yesterday's horrifying massacre. Bob Orr will tell \n      you more about Cho Seung-Hui, the 23-year-old English major responsible \n      for killing 32 people before turning a gun on himself. Officials haven't \n      yet put together a full picture of Cho, saying only that \"he was a loner.\" \n      But there are some clues that might shed light on his motivation, and \n      we'll share those with you. The identities of the victims are \n      still being released, but it is already clear that Cho's bullets cut \n      across a wide swatch of the campus population. The dead range from bright \n      college freshmen to a 76-year-old internationally renowned engineering \n      professor. Cynthia Bowers will bring you portraits of those \n      murdered. Also, Sharyn Alfonsi will report on what happened \n      in the critical two hours when Cho eluded police. Thalia \n      Assuras will chronicle the grieving process on campus. And our \n      technology correspondent, Daniel Sieberg, will take a look at \n      social networking online in the wake of the tragedy. I hope \n      you'll join us tonight, and be sure to tune in at 10 p.m. ET to a special \n      edition of 48 Hours this evening called Anatomy of a \n      Rampage.
