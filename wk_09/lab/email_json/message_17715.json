Removed chron versions of these\n       functions.\n\n       Placed Hmisc in a namespace\n\n       Factored out category levels that are identical (and in the same\n       order) for multiple variables.  Changed print and html methods\n       accordingly, and made new default for html output,\n       levelType='list'.\n\n       new argument levelType in html.contents.data.frame\n\n       enhanced html.data.frame to set column headings in h2\n\n       added curtail option (default: FALSE) for type='regression' to\n       set imputed values to the boundaries of real data if outside\n\n       added datadensity argument to plot.aregImpute\n\n       fixed bug with curtail, added datadensity argument to\n       plot.aregImpute\n\n       fixed typo related to bass argument\n\n       fixed bug in latex.describe to translate underscores in variable\n       names when listing those with all NAs\n\n       fixed inmChoice by unclassing first argument when pasting\n\n       handled underscore in dataset name in latex.describe by calling\n       latexTranslate\n\n       Finished addition of listunique and listnchar, handled listing\n       of character values in latex.describe.*\n\n       listunique and listnchar\n\n       For listunique option ignored multiple white spaces, leading and\n       trailing white spaces, and case in tabulating character strings.\n\n       For listunique ignored leading and trailing white space,\n       multiple white spaces, and case when tabulating character\n       strings. Carriage returns without new lines are changed to a\n       single space.\n\n       Modified 'extracolheads' such that when cgroup and n.cgroup are\n       used in a latex.summary.formula.reverse statement the extra N=\n       columns line up correctly.\n\n       added boot.method argument to implement approximate Bayesian\n       bootstrap when group is not used\n\n       'R/inc-dec.s' created 2 new functions 'inc<-' and 'dec<-'. \n'inc<-' increments\n       'x' by value assigned to it.  'dec<-' does the same thing but \ndecrements 'x'.\n\n       'R/responseSummary.s' changed 'responseSummary' 'FUN' argument\n       so that is it run on each row of the response instead of the\n       whole of the response.\n\n       'R/latexObject.s' changed names of constant escapes.\n\n       'R/combine.s' functions to perform element wise combination.\n\n       'R/print.char.list.s'  various code simplifications.\n\n       Corrected extra escapes in latexSN function.  fixes #10.\n\n3.2-1 1/25/2007:\n       Hmisc function 'ecdf' has been renamed 'Ecdf' to deconflict it\n       with the existing 'ecdf' function in base.\n\n       Fixed Bug in format.df that would create numbers with many\n       trailing zeros.\n\n       Added arguments 'math.row.names' and 'math.col.names' to\n       indicate that the row or col names should be wrapped in the\n       latex math environment.\n\n       Fixed problem with 'histbackback' function.\n\n-- \nCharles Dupont\tComputer System Analyst\t\tSchool of Medicine\n\t\tDepartment of Biostatistics\tVanderbilt University\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
