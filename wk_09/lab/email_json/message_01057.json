The show of force was \n      orchestrated by the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, who proved that \n      he commands an enormous following among Iraq's largest religious group. \n      Martin Seemungal is in Baghdad, and will have more on this story \n      tonight. Iran announced a dramatic expansion of uranium \n      enrichment, saying it has begun operating 3,000 centrifuges. That's nearly \n      10 times the previously known number, and is in defiance of U.N. demands \n      that it halt the program or face increased sanctions. We will have a \n      reality check on the real threat from Iran. President Bush is \n      making another push for immigration reform. He visited the U.S.-Mexico \n      border to tout a guest worker program for immigrants. With up to 12 \n      million illegal immigrants in the U.S., lawmakers haven't agreed on how to \n      uphold the law without disrupting lives, eroding the work force and \n      risking political upheaval. Kelly Cobiella will report from the \n      desert stretch where Arizona and Mexico meet. Border agents there say they \n      are pelted with rocks and the victims of assault from smugglers. In fact, \n      there have been more assaults against agents in the Yuma sector this year \n      than all of last year. At any one time in this country, as many as \n      100,000 people are suffering from heart failure, but only about 2,000 \n      people a year receive heart transplants. For a long time, doctors were \n      focused on developing a heart pump as a bridge to when a new heart becomes \n      available. But a new device is showing it can be more than just a bridge. \n      Our contributing medical correspondent, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, \n      will tell you about this. There's also a growing uproar over radio \n      host Don Imus' racially charged comments about the Rutgers University \n      women's basketball team. Despite his on-air apologies, the calls continue \n      for him to be fired from his syndicated morning program, after his \n      racially charged comments. Imus appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton's radio \n      program today and issued another apology. Richard Schlesinger will \n      have this report, and will discuss the FCC's regulations as well. \n      Finally, for computer researcher Zombie Bell even his morning walk \n      to work is part of a grand experiment in digitizing and remembering \n      everything. The little camera around his neck takes a picture every 30 \n      seconds or so, and a sound recorder rolls non-stop. Bell is saving his \n      whole life on computer, from childhood certificates to all his medical \n      records. John Blackstone will have his story. I hope \n      to see you tonight.

Ed soon found himself in the Army, where he learned to get \n      things done in hostile places. It was not long after that he began his \n      life as a freelance humanitarian. When Ed met Jim in Moscow in 1993, the \n      two knew they were destined for great things. In Moscow, Ed became a \n      Knight of Malta, a humanitarian order that dates back to the Crusades. \n      Jim, already a Knight for his Community Service, became intrigued by Ed's \n      courage. The two formed Knightsbridge and raise money like any charity, \n      but their ability to distribute large quantities of aid and medicine \n      directly to the people at the end of the line is what sets them apart. Ed \n      Artis and Jim Laws have risked their lives distributing tens of millions \n      of dollars worth of aid to the needy, and they couldn't be happier.
