The glibc is the crux of all of \nthis toolchain, and the same reason why that old viavoice became \na nightmare to support. The distro folks like patrick play with gcc,\nglibc, and binutils combination until they find a stable combination\nto build the entire system out of. The kernel headers, as he states \nin his warning, it's dangerous to use headers newer than the glibc\nversion on your system. You can still build the 2.6.x kernel. There\nare some situations where stuff will not build, which is why he has\nthe headers on the site, but don't change headers as a default \nstarting point, only as a last resort. And yes, you don't need the \nmodules, in fact you don't need anything from there. Patrick uses\nONLY unmodified kernels anyways, so if you want the latest \nthat still works with speakup, grab the last of the 2.21.x from \nkernel.org. Or be like us old folks who prefer the stable \n\"trailing edge\". I have not found a need for 2.6.x yet, so using\nPatrick's similar logic, I will do so when I have a reason to. \nI used to chase the leading edge kernels but found that it was \ngenerally a waste of time in the large scheme of things.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
