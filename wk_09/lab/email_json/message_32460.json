CBS News \n      will celebrate the legendary newsman's singular life and career in a CBS \n      News primetime special, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS - CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT \n      90,\" to be broadcast Friday, May 18th (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS \n      Television Network. \n\n\n\nSATURDAY ON 48 HOURSHere's a note from Producer \n      Miguel Sancho on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, Beyond the \n      Boardwalk: \"This report is a heartbreaker. It chronicles the \n      tragic descent of four beloved but troubled women onto the harsh streets \n      of Atlantic City, and their ultimate demise at the hands of a suspected \n      serial killer. Like any good 48 Hours Mystery episode, this \n      program provides in-depth coverage of the crime and the investigation: the \n      case is a true whodunit, replete with intriguing clues and some very \n      unusual suspects. But just as importantly, the report explores the \n      dynamics of the criminal underworld where the victims, and many young \n      women like them, found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of \n      drug-abuse, prostitution, and violence. From a producer's \n      perspective, covering this story was an intense and harrowing experience. \n      Atlantic City is an awesome place -- in the very literal sense of \n      inspiring awe. To its great credit, Atlantic City does not pretend to be \n      Disneyland - it is an unabashed adult entertainment environment. And it \n      cannot be denied that the gaming industry has created tens of thousands of \n      jobs, and streamed countless millions of tax revenues into the state. \n      Still, when you first arrive in town, the contrast between the hulking \n      casinos and the squalor that surrounds them is a shock. Frankly the place \n      can look like a collaboration of Bukowski and Bosch. Then, as you start to \n      get a sense of how the streets operate and who the players are - the \n      not-so-hidden economy of sin-seeking tourists, drug dealers, hustlers, and \n      street-walkers - there's the thrill of gaining secret, specialized \n      knowledge. Atlantic City is, truly, one of most fascinating places I have \n      ever been, and for the journalist and the junkie alike, the action of \n      street life is an addiction all its own. But after a while, as you become \n      attached to people whose lives are so sad and hopeless, reporting becomes \n      an emotional ordeal. It is hard to wade through all the human wreckage of \n      the city's dark side without absorbing some of the suffering one \n      witnesses. After three days there, you want desperately to leave. Of \n      course once you've left you can think only about going back. It \n      may be easy for people to dismiss the murders as a story of four women who \n      succumbed to their own bad judgment and worse luck. Others may see the \n      killer as a something of an allegorical figure, a human embodiment of the \n      danger and damage of drug addiction. But if there's one thing I hope the \n      viewers remember, it is that these women, for all their problems, were \n      very real human beings. They all had families and friends who loved them. \n      They all had young children. And whatever bad choices they'd made, none of \n      them deserved this.\" - Miguel Sancho (48 \n      Hours Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT) If you would \n      like more information on any of these stories or the broadcast, please \n      click on the following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWSHere is an early \n      preview of what we are planning for tonight\u0092s CBS EVENING NEWS from Anchor \n      and Managing Editor, Katie Couric\u0085 Hi everyone, \n      The Middle East is plunging deeper into chaos as clashes continue \n      between rival Palestinian groups in Gaza.

CHARLES OSGOOD \n      ANCHORS FROM CHICAGO PERFECTVILLE: Most Americans live \n      either in large cities or suburban homes where life revolves around the \n      automobile and traffic. Now government officials, city planners, \n      architects are proposing another way. Small towns, old-fashioned \n      neighborhoods where people talk with the folks next door are popping up in \n      the suburbs and in previously ignored parts of overcrowded cities. It is \n      called the New Urbanism. It's goal--return the word \"community\" to the \n      lives of Americans, and also get us out of our cars and walking again. \n      Rita Braver reports. CLEANING UP: Invention is a \n      great Chicago tradition. In fact, the first manually powered vacuum \n      cleaner was patented there by Ives McGaffey in 1869.

We'll ask Senator Dianne \n      Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Arlen Specter, Republican of \n      Pennsylvania. Then we'll turn to the troop surge in Iraq and have a debate \n      between Major General Paul Eaton (Ret.) who thinks it's not working, and \n      Military Historian Frederick Kagan, who thinks it is. There will be, as \n      always, a final word.
