He doesn't know why they choose him and he's usually too busy to wonder why.\n\nIt's easier to be wise for others than for ourselves.\n\nI can't tell you how many shows I've done with full-blown migraine headaches.\n\nSurmounting difficulty is the crucible that forms character.\n\nBig pay and little responsibility are circumstances seldom found together.\n\nAny girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\n\n\n"}
