I'll look into that. Is there an authoritative document\nthat codifies the new package development procedures for 2.5.0\n(windows-specific), or is that Writing R Extensions? In this thread\nalone I've received multiple emails pointing to multiple web sites with\ninstructions for windows. Inasmuch as its appreciated, I'm a bit\nconfused as to which I should consider authoritative.\n\nI do hope I can resolve this and appreciate the help I've received.\nHowever, I feel a bit compelled to note how very difficult this process\nis. \n\nHarold\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Duncan Murdoch [mailto:murdoch@stats.uwo.ca] \n> Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2007 3:24 PM\n> To: Doran, Harold\n> Cc: Gabor Grothendieck; r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [SPAM] - Re: [R] R package development in windows - \n> Bayesian Filter detected spam\n> \n> On 5/3/2007 3:04 PM, Doran, Harold wrote:\n> > Thanks Gabor, Sundar, and Tony.
