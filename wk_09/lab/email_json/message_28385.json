He\njust likes to push people's buttons to get a rise out of them by reciting\nOxycontin-addled Rush Limabugh-isms.\n\n> Of course, I have a sneaking suspicion that, as someone from\n> jesusanswers.com, you figure that the Second Coming will just take care of\n> any messes people make.\n\nYou need fear not about this, though.  Despite being politically\nreactionary, our Donny is quite enlightened on the matter of religion.\nI.e., it's the Oxycontin of the masses.  After all, not everyone has the\ndisposible income, and Dr. Feelgood connections of Mr. Limbaugh.\n\n|>oug\n\n"}
