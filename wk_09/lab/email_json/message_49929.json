Erected in memory of Prince Alemayehu Tewodros,\nit reads: \"I was a stranger and ye took me in.\" \n\nThe memorial plate and the skeletal remains that lie behind it are the only\nconcrete traces of the tragic and extraordinary tale of a seven-year-old boy\nwho became embroiled in what many believe was the greatest orgy of looting\nconducted in the name of the British Empire.\n\nThe child prince, the son of the Ethiopian emperor Tewodros II, who has a\nclaimed bloodline stretching back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba,\nwas captured in April 1868 by the British Army, which conquered the ancient\ncitadel of Magdala.\n\nAlemayehu, a royal orphan, was transported to England to be educated as a\ngentleman. Along with him came so many looted treasures, including religious\nartefacts and 350 manuscripts, that it reportedly took 15 elephants and 200\nmules to carry them from Magdala to the nearest sea port. The prince died\nbarely a decade later of pleurisy and a broken heart, some 4,000 miles from\nhis homeland, in Leeds. Among his mourners was Queen Victoria herself.\n\nWhile the life of Alemayehu ranks as little more than a colonial-era\ncuriosity in Britain, the events of 139 years ago are still keenly felt as\nan injustice in Ethiopia. The country, where European visitors are proudly\nreminded that it was never occupied for more than two years by a colonial\npower, has conducted a decades-long campaign for the return of the\ntreasures. It recently celebrated the return of a 70ft obelisk from Italy.\n\nThese sentiments were resurrected two weeks ago when the country's\nPresident, Wolde-Giorgis Girma, formally wrote to the Queen asking for the\nremains of Prince Alemayehu to be exhumed and returned to Ethiopia for\nburial in time for the country celebrating its millennium in September.\nEthiopia operates according to the Ethiopic calendar, which runs seven years\nbehind the Western Julian calendar and marks the new year in September. The\nyear 2000 will therefore arrive on 12 September 2007.\n\nThe campaign was further underlined yesterday when a nine-year-old schoolboy\nof Ethiopian origin delivered a petition to Downing Street calling for the\nrestitution of the Magdala artefacts, which are spread throughout\ninstitutions such as the British Library and British Museum and include six\nilluminated manuscripts held in the royal library at Windsor.\n\nGabriel Kassayie, who collected more than 100 signatures among his\nclassmates at a primary school in Hampstead, north London, said: \"I wanted\nto do something. I learned how the artefacts were stolen from my country and\nhow attempts to get them back were prevented. I wanted to do this for my\nancestors.\"\n\nCampaigners in Ethiopia argue that the epitaph to the prince in St George's\nChapel is laden with irony: Alemayehu was not so much taken in as spirited\naway. Although Queen Victoria took a personal interest in Alemayehu's\nupbringing (reputedly paying his fees for Rugby School), they argue he was\njust as much of a \"war trophy\" as the gold crowns and altar pieces seized by\nthe army of Sir Robert Napier, sent by the monarch to crush Emperor Tewodros\nin 1868.\n\nMulugeta Aserate, a second cousin of Ethiopia's last emperor, Haile\nSelassie, and a senior figure on the organising committee of the millennium\ncelebrations, said the return of the remains for burial in a monastery in\nthe northern city of Gondar would remove a blight on relations with Britain.\nHe told The Independent: \"The prince was a prisoner of war. Our relations\nwith Britain are good and warm but the episode of Prince Alemayehu\nrepresents a dark side of that relationship.\n\n\"His return would be a cause for celebration here and what better time for\nit than this very African millennium of ours? He died in a foreign land but\nAlemayehu's name has not been forgotten in Ethiopia.\" It is a further irony\nthat the capture of the prince has its roots in an ill-fated attempt by his\nfather to foster strong relations with Britain. In the late 1860s, the\nChristian emperor had sought the help of Britain in trying to protect\nEthiopia from the Ottoman Empire and Egypt.\n\nWhen his entreaties went ignored and he imprisoned the British diplomatic\nmission, Napier inflicted a crushing defeat against his army on 10 April\n1868 at Magdala, a fortified mountaintop in central Ethiopia.\n\nTewodros freed the prisoners and sent the British general a gift of cattle\nto be slaughtered for Easter Sunday two days' later. When Napier replied\nwith thanks, offering a safe conduct for Tewodros and his family, the\nemperor angrily rejected the overture and vowed never to be taken alive.\nAfter heavy bombardment, Tewodros committed suicide on Easter Monday,\nleaving the British to loot the palaces and churches and capture his young\nheir.\n\nThe American journalist Henry Morton Stanley who witnessed the aftermath of\nthe battle, describe how the plunder covered \"the whole surface of the rocky\ncitadel, the slopes of the hill and the entire road to the [British] camp\ntwo miles off\".\n\nThe British insisted it had been the dying wish of Emperor Tewodros that his\nson and his mother, Queen Terunesh, be looked after by the victorious power.\n\nWhatever the truth of this, the leaders of the expedition recognised the\nusefulness of the prince as a potential pawn in its efforts to expand\nBritish dominion in east Africa to Abyssinia, as Ethiopia was then known.\n\nWhen Queen Terunesh died a month later on the journey from Magdala to the\nRed Sea, a British officer, Captain Tristram Speedy, was appointed as the\nguardian of the young boy.\n\nSpeedy, who was 6ft 6in and sported a bushy red beard, was a veteran of\nBritish campaigns from India to New Zealand. Speedy, a speaker of Amharic,\nthe Ethiopian language, dismissed the prince's tutor, Alaqa Zenneb, before\nbeginning the sea voyage to Britain and it seems he rapidly formed a close\nbond with his new charge. In his journal, he described how a terrified\nAlemayehu refused to leave his side, day or night.\n\nSpeedy wrote: \"The distressing alarm that then seized him rendered him so\ntimid that for the following three months no persuasion could induce him to\nsleep out of my arms, so great was his terror that if he happened to wake\nand find me asleep, he would wake me and earnestly beg me to remain awake\nuntil he should fall asleep, and it was only by continued care and\ntenderness that he is gradually losing his timidity.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that such comforting by the \"gentle giant\" officer was\nanything other than paternal. But it is fitting proof of how the Victorian\nempire builders saw their obligations towards a young boy considered a near\ndivinity in Ethiopia.\n\nOnce in England, the heir of the King Solomon, shown in early photographs\nwith the braided hair and elaborate costume of Abyssinian royalty, began his\nconversion into an English gentleman. He left the care of Speedy and his\nwife in 1871 and was sent to live with Dr Thomas Jex-Blake, the headmaster\nof Cheltenham College, who later was appointed to the same post at Rugby\nSchool.\n\nLater pictures of the teenage prince, who was patronisingly recorded on his\nvoyage to Britain as not having \"the faintest notion\" what to do with a\nknife and fork and had to be shown how to put marmalade on his toast, show\nhim dressed in a tweed suit reading a heavy tome. Evidence suggests the\nphotos were showing Alemayehu as something which he was not. Speedy recorded\n\"he had no interest in his books and had an utter dislike for anything in\nthat line\" while his tutors at Rugby stated baldly: \"Progress in study he\nwill never make.\" Instead, the prince was dispatched to Sandhurst Military\nAcademy. He was no happier there. Despite frequently expressing a desire to\nreturn to Ethiopia, the government refused all his requests.\n\nDr Mandefro Belayneh, an Ethiopian academic researching the life of\nAlemayehu, said: \"He didn't have any friends or family to call on. There\nwere letters coming from Abyssinia from his grandmother ... and all the\nletters said, 'When are you coming back? Your people are expecting you'. But\nI suspect these letters were never shown to him.\"\n\nThe prince died in October 1879. His funeral was held in St George's Chapel.\n\nBuckingham Palace yesterday declined to comment on the request from\nPresident Girma. Ethiopian sources suggested that although the request was\nbeing considered favourably, there were potential problems with identifying\nthe remains.\n\nBut arguably, the official verdict on Britain's role in the life of Prince\nAlemayehu was delivered long ago. After his death, Queen Victoria wrote in\nher diary: \"It is too sad. All alone in a strange country, without a single\nperson or relative belonging to him. His was no happy life.\"\n\nhttp://news.independent.co.uk/\n\n____________________________________\nMuseum Security Network / Museum Security Consultancy\nPostbus 3213\n3003 AE Rotterdam\nThe Netherlands\n+31 10 2233897\n+31 6 242 246 20\ntoncremers@museum-security.org\n_______________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 144\n****************************************\n\n"}
