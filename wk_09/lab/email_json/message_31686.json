What might need to be changed\nare some #defines, etc. in the C code.\n\nIt is much more flexible and easier approach than exchanging data via\nfiles and creating scripts in for R to execute.\n\nBos, Roger wrote:\n> The new version of S+ (version 8.0) is supposed to be able to read R\n> code unmodified.
