I keep myself fit and I have been using Viagra for 3 years. \nI prefer taking small amounts --. half or even less of a 25mg tablet, This amount works on an empty stomach \nwith half a glass of water. I occasionally take about 20mgs - then wow, I want to go on for hours! I have tried\n taking 25mg and 50mg at one time but I find it is too much and reduces the sensations. It is a sensational product!\n\nHope you will enjoy the convenient interface of our online store!\n\n\n"}
