I also had Etch running on my IBM T43 and \nactually got the ipw2200 working till a kernel upgrade came through and then I lost wireless and being a noob I \ncouldn't get it going again :-)\nI tried Linux Mint (Cassandra) and only one click got my wireless working.\nAll the Beryl things work out of the box too. And the T43 doesn't have Nvidia.\nRegards\nGeoff\n> \n> \n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
