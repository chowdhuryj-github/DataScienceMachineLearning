After the \nviavoice was no longer compatible, I managed to do a painful\nbuild where I had two versions of glibc installed, one for use \nwith viavoice and one that was current. Spent many hours on \nthis, and although it worked, I eventually gave up on viavoice.\nDoes this mean capital accessibility is able to rebuild the ibm\nviavoice (actually eloquence inside) tts engine for compatibility \nwith new c libararies? Or does it use some kind of wrapper \ncode as compatibility layer? Can programs be compiled from\nsource using the eci.h header?\n\nGlad to see viavoice is still alive.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
