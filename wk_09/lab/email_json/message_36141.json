I don't know much \non this test and then, I have few questions on the independence_test \nfunction. I have read the help and search the archives but this doesn't \nhelp me...\n \n- They are two ways: either with a formula (independence_test(tumor ~ \ndose, data = lungtumor, teststat = \"quad\")) or with a table \n(independence_test(table(lungtumor$dose, lungtumor$tumor), teststat = \n\"quad\")).\nWhy this difference ? The two ways do not give the same results... Why \n?\n \n- In the teststat option, what is the difference between \"quad\", \"max\" \nand \"scalar\" ? What is used generaly ?\n \n- Why choosing approximate or asymptotic distribution if an exact test \ncan be calculate ?\n \nFor a classical Cochran Armitage test (nothing special was specified \nso I guess I have to do the most classical Cochran Armitage test), \nwhich options should I use ?\n \nThanks for your help.\n \nDelphine Fontaine\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
