It is possible via amazon.com (and\nI guess also for a series of other books on your list).\nI think using MASS together with the included manuals (especially \"An\nIntroduction to R\") is probably the best way to get you started.\n\nBest,\nRoland\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n \nThis information is being sent at the recipient's request or...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
