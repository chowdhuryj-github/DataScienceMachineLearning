Developing countries need to\nunderstand that their greatest strength is in numbers - in their\nwillingness to aggregate markets to energize generic entry and then robust\ngeneric prices that will drive the costs of medicine lower and lower over\ntime.  Brazil thought it had gotten good deals three times in the past only\nto discover that the advantages of temporary and partial price discounts\nwere overrun by the dynamics of generic competition, often aided by\nbehind-the-scenes efforts by the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIt may be hard for Thailand to justify paying higher prices for a generic\nproduct in the short run, but the advantages of having multiple and more\nlocal suppliers to prevent stock-outs and the advantages of helping to\ncreate a highly competitive generics market outweigh the temporary\nadvantages.  Likewise, although Thailand may feel that it needs to back\ndown because of the intense pressure being exerted by the US, by Big\nPharma, and by right-wing think tanks, the issuance and enforcement of\ncompulsory licenses will get easier over time as developing countries\novercome the first-mover problem and more and more countries jump on board.\n\nThe need for compulsory licenses in producing countries and/or in exporting\nand importing countries will become more intense over time as Pharma\npatents its newer medicines more intensively in developing countries and as\nall the major producing countries have now been required to adopt product\npatents and to issue patents on post-TRIPS medical innovations.  Hopefully,\nThailand can become convinced to do no more than suspend, rather than\nrevoke the compulsory license, or better yet continue to source generics\nbecause of the long-term and collective advantage of doing so.\n\nBrook\n\nBangkok Post, May 24, 2007\n\nhttp://www.bangkokpost.net/News/24May2007_news02.php\n\nDRUGS PATENT ROW / INFORMAL TALKS WITH US PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM\n\nGovt considers revoking compulsory licence for Efavirenz\n\nAPIRADEE TREERUTKUARKUL\n\nThe government is considering revoking the compulsory licence issued for a\ngeneric version of the HIV/Aids medicine Efavirenz after a promising start\nto informal talks with patent holder Merck & Co Inc in the United States\nyesterday.\n\nPublic Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla said Merck representatives\nproposed several interesting options for the anti-retroviral medication\nwhich could lead to a win-win solution for both sides.\n\n''Who wants to buy generic drugs for treating patients if the original drug\nis more affordable?'' he said during a teleconference from the United\nStates.\n\nHis unexpected comment came just one day after he said the trip to the US\nhad failed to make any inroads into ending the disagreements between\nThailand and US pharmaceutical firms.\n\nUS Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez was reported to have put pressure\non the Thai team to abandon its policy of compulsory licensing.\n\nThe Public Health Ministry last November issued a compulsory licence to\nimport a generic version of Efavirenz from Indian drug maker Ranbaxy which\nwould cost 540 baht per month per patient _ considerably cheaper than the\noriginal drug, which costs 726 baht per month per patient.\n\nDr Mongkol did not give details of the options proposed by the New\nJersey-based pharmaceutical firm but said it could be a good example for\nother drug makers whose patents for Aids and blood thinning drugs had been\noverridden.\n\nDr Mongkol insisted the government reserved the right to use compulsory\nlicensing if a problem of access to affordable medicines occurred with any\nlife-threatening disease in Thailand.\n\nThai Public Health, Commerce and Foreign Affairs ministry officials were in\nthe US to explain to US representatives from various sectors, including\npharmaceutical firms, the government's decisions to bypass patents on Aids\ndrugs Efavirenz and Kaletra and the heart drug Plavix.\n\nBilly Tauzin, president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Research\nand Manufacturers of America, representing the leading US pharmaceutical\nresearch and biotechnology companies, also made it clear to the health\nminister that leading American drug firms remained deeply troubled by\nThailand's use of compulsory licensing.\n\n''Pursuing such drastic measures, as the Thai government has done, not only\nhurts the innovative engine that helps economies around the world prosper.\nWorse, it could also limit access to new breakthrough medicines for\npatients suffering from life-threatening diseases such as HIV/Aids and\ncancer,'' he said. ''Clearly, Thai patients deserve better.''\n\nBut Dr Mongkol argued that Washington had received misleading information\nabout Thai policy.\n\nVirat Poorahong of the Thai network Living with HIV/Aids expressed concern\nat the government's indecisiveness.\n\n''We do not support the government threatening drug companies by announcing\ncompulsory licensing. But we want the government to think and act fast,''\nMr Virat said.\n\n''We're talking about the lives of half a million HIV-positive people and\nmany more cancer patients who could be short of life-saving medications.''\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
