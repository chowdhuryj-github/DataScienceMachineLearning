Now you can try a new cvs snapshot of C speech\ndispatcher where are some bug fixes.\n\nBest\n\n\n-- \n\nJan Buchal\nTel: (00420) 24 24 86 008\nMob: (00420) 608023021\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
