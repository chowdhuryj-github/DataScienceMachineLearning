Is src/pmc/ the most appropriate location for a .h file?\nOnly the Class and Object PMCs need this header file. Nothing else \nshould include it. It's part of my attempt to encourage encapsulation. I \nwas following the precedent that src/ contains some .h files (I guess, \nfor a similar reason). I'm pretty sure I've seen .h files show up in \nlanguages PMC directories too.\n\nThe fact that you've pointed out its unusual for a .h file to be there \nis perhaps a good thing, 'cus anyone thinking of including it themselves \nwill hopefully think the same. ;-) If anyone feels really strongly \notherwise, I won't be bothered if it gets moved.\n\nJonathan\n\n"}
