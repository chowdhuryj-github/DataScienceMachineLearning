Yesterday, I sat in on Carrie Underwood's rehearsal \n      and was just blown away by how confidant and in control she\u00a0seems this year. Last year, at this time, \n      she was fresh off\u00a0of \"American \n      Idol\" and the new kid on the block. \n      I asked her\u00a0about the difference that this past year has made in her life.\u00a0Carrie told \n      me that not only has she learned a lot, \n      but that staying close to her mom has kept her grounded during this \n      whirlwind year, during which she has \n      become a huge crossover star. And coming right off of Mother's\u00a0Day, \n      I loved hearing her talk about that.\n\u00a0\nBut the mother \n      daughter-relationship can also be painful, as we saw this morning in Kelli \n      Pickler's live performance of her new single,\"I Wonder.\" Kelli's mom left\u00a0her family when Kelli was just\u00a0two, leaving her with a father who \n      struggled with substance abuse and was in and out of jail most of her \n      childhood (Kelli frequently lived with her \n      grandparents, Faye and Clyde Pickler). Kelli wrote the song as a message to her mother;\u00a0behind-the-scenes,\u00a0we were all near tears as she sang \n      it.\u00a0After she was done singing, \n      I just felt compelled to give her a huge hug! She's such a sweet \n      girl.\n\u00a0\nAnd to round things out, \n      we had another up-and-comer, Miranda Lambert, whose album \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" is\u00a0on top of the country charts. The \n      title for it\u00a0explains \n      her big-time \n      Texas tough attitude (remember her first hit \n      single was called\u00a0\"Kerosene\"!) \n\u00a0\nAnd that's just the \n      beginning of our coverage. We'll have an all- star cast on the show tomorrow, including Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, \n      Brooks & Dunn and Rascal Flatts.\u00a0How's \n      that for a\u00a0country party!\n\u00a0\nAlso tomorrow,\u00a0from New York, we'll have the \n      live announcement of the nominations for this year's Tony Awards. \n      \n\u00a0\nI'll see you tomorrow from \n      Vegas!\n\u00a0\n      \nHannah\u00a0StormEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
