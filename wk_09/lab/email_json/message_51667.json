Entry flight director Norm Knight said the shuttle's systems are operating normally and the only question mark is the weather, with forecasters calling for low clouds and afternoon showers at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nNASA's Mission Management Team, meanwhile was asked to gather for an unusual night-before-landing meeting to resolve a trio of seemingly minor issues:\n\n*** A final imagery assessment to determine, if possible, the nature of debris seen floating between the shuttle and the space station after undocking on Monday. Engineers believe the object is of no consequence, but the image analysis is not yet complete.\n\n*** An aero-thermal assessment to make sure a small bit of unraveled thread that serves as the upper edge of a \"gap filler\" between an outboard leading edge panel on the left wing and an adjacent row of heat-shield tiles poses no threat for significantly higher downstream heating during entry.\n\n*** Consideration of a revised analysis of the heat experienced by Atlantis' left-side rocket pod during ascent when one corner of an insulation blanket peeled back. The blanket was repaired during a spacewalk, but because engineers underestimated how hot the underlying structure got during the climb to space, MMT Chairman John Shannon ordered a final discussion to make sure no one had any concerns.\n\n\"We're just trying to be completely thorough,\" Shannon said. \"The reason we're having an MMT is to make sure everybody understands what assumptions were made, what new data we've learned, what the new thermal assessment is. And we also have to get the final aero-thermal analysis for that little bit of fluff that's on the outboard part of the left wing. We're just going to review those, I think we're going to stomp them flat and then we're going to be done with it and be ready to come home.\"\n\nWeather permitting, of course. As Knight reminded reporters today, \"tomorrow's the first day of summer, by coincidence, and we know what summer brings to Florida, and that's afternoon thunderstorms.\"\n\nThe Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston is predicting scattered clouds at 3,000 feet, a broken deck at 5,000 feet and overcast at 12,000 feet. Winds will be out of 240 degrees at 8 knots with gusts to 13 and thundershowers are expected within 30 nautical miles of the runway. NASA's flight rules require ceilings of at least 8,000 feet and no shower activity within 30 nautical miles.\n\n\"So those are going to be our challenges tomorrow,\" Knight said. \"Obviously, I would like clear skies, unlimited visibility and little wind. But unfortunately, those are not the cards we're typically dealt. We train to this, we're used to this type of environment in Florida. No landing is easy with weather.\"\n\nThe Florida forecast does not get much better Friday and Saturday, although ceilings improve a bit. Atlantis has enough on-board supplies to stay in orbit until Sunday at the latest.\n\n\"We have consumables that will support out through end of mission plus three,\" Knight said. \"What that means in English is, end of mission being Thursday, we also have Friday and Saturday as a weather extension day and we keep Sunday open as a systems wave-off day.\n\n\"So based on this, our weather strategy going into tomorrow is that on Thursday we're only going to target the Kennedy Space Center and we have two opportunities to do that. Friday, we're going to target Kennedy Space Center again. However, we may target the Edwards Air Force Base landing site, it will all depend on the weather, how it looks on Saturday. We'll look at the Saturday forecast. If the Kennedy Space Center is still questionable and Edwards is not pristine, then we will call up Edwards on Friday and land the vehicle.\n\n\"On Saturday, if we still have not landed, we will bring up all three sites, this is what we call pick 'em day, and we will target Kennedy Space Center, followed by Edwards Air Force Base and if we need to, we will land at Northrup (in New Mexico). Don't expect that to happen.\"\n\nHere is an updated timeline of key events (in EDT; correcting initial times in backup landing timeline):\n\nRev. 202 Deorbit to KSC\n\nEDT...........EVENT\n\n08:49:54 AM...Begin deorbit timeline\n09:04:54 AM...Radiators stowed\n09:14:54 AM...Mission specialists seat installation\n09:20:54 AM...Computers set for deorbit prep\n09:24:54 AM...Hydraulic system configuration\n09:49:54 AM...Flash evaporator checkout\n09:55:54 AM...Final payload deactivation\n10:09:54 AM...Payload bay doors closed\n10:19:54 AM...Mission control 'go' for OPS-3 software\n10:29:54 AM...OPS-3 transition\n10:54:54 AM...Entry switch-list verification\n11:04:54 AM...Deorbit PAD update\n11:09:54 AM...Crew entry review\n11:24:54 AM...Commander/pilot don entry suits\n11:41:54 AM...IMU alignment\n11:49:54 AM...CDR/PLT strap in; mission specialists don suits\n12:06:54 PM...Shuttle steering check\n12:09:54 PM...APU pre-start\n12:16:54 PM...Toilet deactivation\n12:24:54 PM...Vent doors closed for entry\n12:29:54 PM...Mission control 'go' for deorbit burn\n12:35:54 PM...Mission specialists seat ingress\n12:44:54 PM...Single APU start\n\n12:49:54 PM...Deorbit ignition (dV: 199 mph; dT: 2:36)\n12:52:30 PM...Deorbit burn complete (alt: 212.8 statute miles)\n\n01:23:48 PM...Entry interface (alt: 75.5 miles)\n01:28:46 PM...1st roll command to left\n01:40:25 PM...1st left-to-right roll reversal\n01:48:44 PM...Velocity less than mach 2.5 (alt: 16.2 miles)\n01:50:56 PM...Velocity less than mach 1 (alt: 9.6 miles)\n01:51:54 PM...Shuttle on the HAC (alt: 6.9 miles)\n01:55:16 PM...Landing\n\n\nRev. 203 Deorbit to KSC\n\n02:05:23 PM...MCC 'go' for deorbit burn\n02:11:23 PM...MS seat ingress\n02:20:23 PM...Single APU start\n\n02:25:23 PM...Deorbit ignition (dV: 201 mph; dT: 2:38)\n02:28:01 PM...Deorbit burn complete (alt: 213.8 statute miles)\n\n02:58:41 PM...Entry interface (alt: 75.6 miles)\n03:03:37 PM...1st roll command to left\n03:14:55 PM...1st left-to-right roll reversal\n03:23:35 PM...Velocity less than mach 2.5 (alt: 16.3 miles)\n03:25:48 PM...Velocity less than mach 1 (alt: 9.5 miles)\n03:26:27 PM...Shuttle on the HAC (alt: 7.7 miles)\n03:30:07 PM...Landing\n\n\"I'm always optimistic,\" Knight said. \"I know the forecast right now is no-go, but clearly, weather changes. As we get closer, we get a better handle on the forecast models. When I left console today I briefed my team and said 'come in tomorrow with the mindset to land this vehicle. Because we're landing at the Kennedy Space Center tomorrow.' That's what we're prepared to do. If the weather does not cooperate, we'll keep the vehicle safe and the crew safe and obviously go around a day.\"\n\nHere is a list of all available landing opportunities, at Kennedy (KSC), Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
