If this does\nnot make the error go away then you have to reduce your resolution\nand/or DefaultDepth. I think this error is not the reason for X to fail\ncompletely, but your graphics rendering will be significantly faster and\nuse less CPU cycles if you get the DRI (direct rendering infrastructure)\ngoing.\n\n2) mouse and touchpad\n\nThere is a problem with the device node for mouse and touchpad. Try to\ndo \"modprobe psmouse\" as root and check if you can start X after that.\nIf this does not help then we need the output of these two commands:\n\nls -l /dev/input/by-id\nawk '/Section \"InputDevice\"/,/EndSection/' /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nAnother thing to try is to add \n\nOption \"AllowMouseOpenFail\"  \"true\"\n\nto the ServerFlags section of your xorg.conf (see \"man xorg.conf\"). This\nwill at least tell you if it is really the mouse issue that keeps X from\nstarting.\n\n-- \nRegards,     | http://users.icfo.es/Florian.Kulzer\n   Florian   |\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
