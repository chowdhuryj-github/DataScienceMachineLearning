'#'   .   \"\\n\" ;  #100/101 characters\n   #Repeat 1370 lines of $shorty into @manylines:\n   # foreach $i (0..1269)  {$manylines[$i] = $shorty} ;  #Succeeds\n   foreach $i (0..1370)    {$manylines[$i] = $shorty} ;\n   $manylines[$#manylines + 1] =  'echo \"Last Line of large program!\"' ;\n   print qx(@manylines) ;\n   # system(qq(@manylines)) ;   #Same problem.\n\n\nHowever, appending the following lines to the above code\nwill properly execute those 1370  lines.  \n   open(OUTFILE, \">/tmp/zz.out\") ;\n   print(OUTFILE  @manylines) ;\n   close(OUTFILE) ;\n   system(\"bash /tmp/zz.out\") ;\nWhile I can run this latter code, it both adds more code \nand adds a file to the operating system's filesystem.\n\nCan qx() accept large numbers of characters,\nperhaps using some simple technique?\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nJameson C.
