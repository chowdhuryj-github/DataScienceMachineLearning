All lenders require that information, so no one can borrow\nmoney in the consumer's name until he or she lifts the freeze. It's\nsimple, and it works.

Their list of [1]the hundred best games ever is\ntop-heavy with Nintendo titles, a full five out of the top ten being\nreleased to a Nintendo platform. Obviously, this sort of thing can get\ncontentious, and CNet's Crave blog [2]spoke up quickly with a contrary\nopinion. \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is truly a masterpiece\nthat should be thought of as one of the greatest games ever created. But\nto call it the greatest game of all time is a serious misstatement.\nUnlike Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time was released in an era where\nvideo games were booming and sales were on the rise. Simply put, everyone\nwas playing video games, and the game was the best of its time. But no\nother game in history--Ocarina of Time included--was able to save an\nentire industry from almost guaranteed destruction the way Super Mario\nBros. did, and it is for this reason that we should all give ol' Mario\nand Luigi credit where it's due.\" Let's hear it, then. What game deserves\nto top a list of the 100 best games ever made?\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/03/2051221\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6261546.stm\n    1. http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6231&Itemid=2\n    2. http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9739180-1.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=Crave\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
