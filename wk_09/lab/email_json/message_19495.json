It seems like this would do it pretty fast:\n\nRe <- rnorm(n = 2e+06, mean = - 1)\n\n> system.time(Re <- rnorm(n = 2e+06, mean = - 1))\n[1] 0.77 0.01 0.78   NA   NA\n\n  I'm not sure what you expect Re to be (a list with 100000 vectors of\nlength 20?), but you could reshape one long vector into a matrix or\nwhatever you might need.  For example:\n\nRe.mat <- matrix(Re, ncol=20)\n\n> Usman\n> \n> \n> \n> \n>       ___________________________________________________________\n> \n> now.\n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n\n\n-- \nChuck Cleland, Ph.D.\nNDRI, Inc.\n71 West 23rd Street, 8th floor\nNew York, NY 10010\ntel: (212) 845-4495 (Tu, Th)\ntel: (732) 512-0171 (M, W, F)\nfax: (917) 438-0894\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
