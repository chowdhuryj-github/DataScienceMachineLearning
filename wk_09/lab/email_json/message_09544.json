The data stream that I am getting \nis actually from an SQL query a users ID, like \"jones12a3\", a subsystem \nname associated to that ID, like \"Lotus Notes\", and a number, \"3\" tied \nto the number of subsystems changes that that user has implemented.  so \nthat stream comes at me like...\n\njones12a3, lotusnotes, 3, jones12a3, unix, 4, jones12a3, linux, 13, \nsmith18a1, unix, 5, smith, ... etc...\n\nso i use the ID as the key in the first hash, and the value is a new \nanonymous hash whos key is the subsystem name, and value is the number \nof changes...\n\nso i have:\njones12a3 => {lotusnotes => 3 unix => 4 linux => 13}\nsmith18a1 => {unix => 5}\n\nand so forth..\n\ni have used Data::Dumper to see the actual output and it is as \nexpected... but i want to use the data in that anonymous hash and \niterate through it getting a count and such..\n\ni can't seem to figure out how to get to it once it is in there...\n\ndo i dereference it somehow?  they are anonymous hashes, so they have no \nname...\n\nsorry for the lack of real information here but the actual code is at \nwork, and i am emailing this from home... but hopefully someone here has \nrun into this before... Thanks in advance!\n\nCK\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
