No test has yet been written in  \n> part because this is a subroutine which is not really well  \n> positioned in its current package.  Everything else in  \n> Parrot::Configure has to do with initial configuration; runstep()  \n> has to do with *re-running* a step after Configure.pl has already  \n> completed.  It's a tool that some Parrot developers use (Patrick  \n> Michaud has spoken up for it), but is not used by make.\n>\n> Additional problem:  Parrot::Configure also has subroutines named  \n> runstep() and _runstep().  Ideally, any refactoring would include  \n> less confusing names.\n>\n> Because runstep() runs after Configure.pl, any tests for it should  \n> go into the t/postconfigure/ directory.\n>\n> So the task is to write unit tests for Parrot::Configure::runstep()  \n> and, if appropriate, to refactor it, with that refactoring possibly  \n> including renaming and/or relocating the subroutine.\n>\n> kid51\n\n"}
