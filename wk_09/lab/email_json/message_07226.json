Hi everyone, I'll be \n      anchoring a special hour-long broadcast tonight from Blacksburg, Virginia, \n      where earlier today a gunman opened fire multiple times at the Virginia \n      Tech University, resulting in the deadliest campus massacre in U.S. \n      history. Our team of correspondents will bring you complete coverage. \n      We will start by telling you about the incidents that began \n      unfolding at 7:15 this morning in one of the largest residence halls on \n      the Virginia Tech campus and continued two hours later at Norris Hall, an \n      engineering building. By late morning, at least 33 on campus were dead. President Bush said \n      he was \"horrified\" by the news of the shooting, and expressed his sympathy \n      for the victims and their families. Thalia Assuras will talk with \n      some of the students who survived the shooting and have more eyewitness \n      accounts. Daniel Sieberg, our Science and Technology \n      Correspondent, will detail how the university and the students who study \n      there used Internet communications to keep one another informed as the \n      tragedy unfolded. And in the wake of such a massacre, it is \n      natural to ask \"could this have been prevented?\" Hari Sreenivasan \n      will report on the state of security on campuses around the country. \n      In the meantime, residents of the Northeast are coping with the \n      remnants of a massive storm that hit over the weekend, bringing record \n      rainfall and strong winds. By Monday afternoon, much of the East Coast was \n      still under water and hundreds of thousands of people were without \n      electricity. Nancy Cordes will have the story. The National \n      Urban League is releasing a report tomorrow that will show that black men \n      in America don't have many of the same privileges as other citizens. We'll \n      have the study's findings tonight. I hope you'll join us. \n      In the meantime, stay updated on news out of Virginia by visiting \n      CBSNews.com.

With at least 30 dead \n      and close to 22 injured, it is the worst campus shooting in United States \n      history. Police say the gunman killed a victim in a dorm, and then later \n      opened fire in a classroom where most of the fatalities occurred.
