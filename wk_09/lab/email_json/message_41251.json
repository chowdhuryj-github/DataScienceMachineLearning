I know that I get calculate the column totals of a table with\n`apply(mytable, 2, sum)'. Now I want each column total to be 100% and\ncalculate the percentage of each field of the column. How would I do that?\nRcommander, the ultimate newb-tool, has a function `colPercents' which is\nexactly what I need, but I do not want to load the whole thing into memory\njust for this function. Is there a way to load just this single function\nfrom the Rcmdr package?\n\nMany thanks,\nRehceb Rotkiv\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Calculating-column-percentages-of-a-table-tf3858317.html#a10931035\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
