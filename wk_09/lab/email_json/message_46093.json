The professor declares that a straight forward\nexposition of a single case for example, Benin bronzes, does not help the\nunderstanding of a specific case nor the general issue.\n\n    The author refers to the colonial and imperialist expansion overseas and\nthe resulting presence of several artworks in the museums of Western Europe.\nHe cites the example of the \"Montezuma's Crown\" which is the State symbol of\nMexico. Mexico has been claiming the return from Austria of this crown for\nyears without success. The professor states that the loudest claim comes\nfrom a single person who has no legitimate basis and has been playing with\nthe sense of justice of the Indians and the love of the Viennese for the\nIndians! (\"die Indianerliebe der Wiener\") The demand was, according to the\nprofessor, made by communist emigrants who had returned to Mexico and was\nalso supported by the SPO and the Greens.\n\n    The author adds that most of the stolen Benin objects, including those\nin Vienna were the result of the British punitive expedition of 1897 and\nmentions the killing of the British delegation. The professor does not\nexplain what the British delegation was doing there. He does not explain\nthat the Oba of Benin had told the British that he was not ready to receive\nthem and that the time they proposed to visit Benin was not appropriate\nsince it was a period in which certain traditional rites were to be\nperformed and therefore not advisable for foreigners to visit his country. \n\n    The professor then refers to the restoration of Nazi stolen goods and\nsays that it was the atrocity of the Nazi regime which led to an attempt at\nrestitution \"Die Monstrosit?t der Nazi-Verbrechen hat zum Versuch einer\nWiedergutmachung gef?hrt\".He then asks whether one is going to correct all\ninjustices of the past: \"Can one restore America to the Indians? (\"Kann man\nAmerika den Indianern zur?ckgeben?) Is slavery reversible? (Ist die\nSklaverei reversibel?\") The professor ends his exposition with a declaration\nthat we could as well request compensation for the oldest stealing in\nhistory \"Wiedergutmachung des ?ltesten Diebstahls der (biblischen)\nGeschichte\".\n\n    This article by the Director of the V?lkerkunde Museum is remarkable in\nmany aspects.\n\n Contrary to the position of the infamous Declaration on Universal Museums\nthat each claim of restitution should be examined on its own merit, the\nprofessor states that it would be unhelpful to examine each case on its own.\nSo you should not examine Benin's demand in isolation but in a context where\nyou deal with Montezuma's Crown, the return of America to the Native\nAmericans, compensation for the Nazi stolen goods and the original crime or\nsin by Adam and Eve. So instead of clear claims, you deal with an incredible\namalgam of issues of entirely different qualities and dimensions. Is it\nlegitimate to compare a precise historical fact of modern times, the looting\nand invasion of Benin by the British in 1897 with a mythological fact of\ntrillions of years, or even before reckoning of time started, the creation\nof the universe and the world? Must we really deal with Adam and Eve when we\nask for the return of the Benin artworks from Vienna?\n\nWith this method, you can kill all demands. Do we dare compare the stealing\nof the Benin bronzes with the alleged crime of Eve in eating an apple and\ngiving some to Adam? (Is gender discrimination at work here? Incidentally,\nin the version of the myth of Adam and Eve that I know, it was the snake who\ngave Eve the apple and thus the primary culprit. Moreover, the myth is, as\nfar as I know, usually used to explain the idea of original sin from which\nwe, the sons and daughters of the original sinful couple cannot escape as\nmuch as we try. Our lustful/curious progenitors had partaken of the tree of\nknowledge and as consequence were expelled from Paradise. I have never seen\nit used to illustrate theft as opposed to sin). Is there not an obligation\nfor intellectuals to clarify issues rather than confuse them? Does any one\nunderstand better the issue of the return of the Benin art works after he or\nshe has been taken to the dizzy spheres of creation and the cosmos? What is\namazing is the total absence of balance and a sense of proportion in making\nsuch comparisons?\n\n    Should intellectuals not understand and take into account the feelings\nof victims of aggression? Is it allowed that a Viennese ethnologist totally\nignores the feelings and trauma of victims of aggression and thereby throws\noverboard the lessons of Sigmund Freud and the Viennese psychologists and\npsychoanalysts? How can the professor declare that the attempt to restore\nand compensate for property seized by the Nazis was due to the atrocities of\nthe Fascists? Is he saying that without the atrocities there would have been\nno call or need for compensation for the property they seized? Is he telling\nthe people of Benin that they should not place any hope in this example of\nrestitution because there had been no atrocities in their case? Was the\nBritish invasion not an atrocity enough? The professor knows that the\nquestion of legality and legitimacy is not in anyway affected by the fact\nthat the illegal dispossession of a person of his property was or was not\naccompanied by atrocities. Would the professor care to repeat his statement\non the Nazi dispossession to victims or successors to victims of these\nillegalities? \n\n    During the International Symposium at the Hofburg, 9-10 May 2007, I\nstrongly advised the professor that certain arguments should not be made in\nthe presence or to the hearing of the victims of injustice. Apparently, this\nadvice fell on deaf ears. The author declares in his article that in most\nsocieties it was not usual to keep old objects which were no longer used\nwhilst in the Western museums and private collections these objects were\nattributed a value as documentation of foreign culture and as evidence of\nnon-European culture. The implication here is that no values were attached\nto these objects before the Europeans started collecting them. This\ncorresponds to the idea propounded in the catalogue of the Benin Exhibition\nand elsewhere that by being kept in the Western museums these objects have\ngained additional value as aesthetic objects. Such a statement is astounding\nwhen addressed to owners who are claiming the return of their property by\nthose illegally keeping them. Besides, this statement is not true as far as\nBenin is concerned. Some of these art objects are documentary evidence of\nthe history of Benin and as the Benin Royals stated during the International\nSymposium they are needed as records of their history.\n\nDid anybody, anywhere ever ask for slavery to be reversed? Why does the\nprofessor throw in this unfounded demand? To create more confusion? What has\nslavery to do with the restitution of specific art objects in the museums\nand elsewhere? If he wants to talk about demands for restitution, why does\nhe not state clearly the case for compensation for slavery and the demand\nfor final removal of the vestiges of slavery and the arguments against such\ndemands? Should intellectuals not contribute to enlightenment even if they\ndo not share certain views?\n\n    The demand for the return of the stolen or looted art works will\ncontinue for a long time and will not go away. The nature of these works\nmakes it impossible to ignore this question. You can place a Benin bronze\nanywhere you like and the question will always arise. Where did it come from\nand what is it for? Ironically, the argument for defending the anachronistic\ndistinction between art from African countries, which is kept in Museums of\nEthnology and European art which is kept in Art museums and galleries, is\nwhat makes the question of the origin a permanent feature of such\ncollections.\n\nEthnologists and others have always argued that you cannot appreciate\nAfrican artworks as purely aesthetic objects, concentrating on the\ncraftsmanship and the elegance of the objects. That they are best understood\nin their religious and social context. It is this need to know the functions\nand significance of these objects that will keep alive the question of\norigin.\n\n    There is in the article a certain imprecision which leads to confusion,\ninsinuations and misleading impressions. When the professor states that\nUNESCO recommendations were not observed, he does not mention that they were\nnot observed by those Western countries holding illegally these art works\nand creates the impression that the International community does not pay\nmuch attention to UNESCO's efforts.\n\n    It seems to me that the author speaks with two tongues. At the opening\nof the Benin Exhibition and at the International Symposium that followed, he\nspoke about the need for dialogue and co-operation. In this article in\nFALTER, this emphasis disappears and a clear line of refusal is discernible.\nThe people of Benin will no doubt take note of this.\n\n    What is required in the question of restitution is a certain minimum\nsense of justice on the part of those in illegal possession of these art\nobjects and a willingness to arrive at a reasonable solution which will\nenable the victims of imperialist aggression to continue with their history\nand traditions whilst permitting those fascinated by their culture to admire\nand study these works. The selfishness and obstinacy of the Western holders\nof these objects surpass all reasonable limits. \n\n\nKwame Opoku, Vienna. 6 June, 2007.\n\nhttp://www.afrikanet.info/\n\n____________________________________\nMuseum Security Network\nMuseum Security Consultancy\nTon Cremers\nPostbus 3213\n3003 AE Rotterdam\n+31 10 2233897\n+31 6 242 246 20\ntoncremers@museum-security.org\n_______________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Mon, 11 Jun 2007 10:36:49 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Native American artifacts discovered when Lake\n\tOkeechobee's\twaters receded are now under constant guard from looters.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <021b01c7ac03$a8e0e9a0$faa2bce0$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAll eyes on Lake Okeechobee artifacts\nNative American artifacts discovered when Lake Okeechobee's waters receded\nare now under constant guard from looters.\nBY KELLY WOLFE\nThe Palm Beach Post\n\nBELLE GLADE -- Officer David Burnsed is alone out here except for all the\ngators.\n\nAnd it's his job to keep it that way.\n\nHe's an officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,\nposted at the mucky gateway to 2,000 years of Florida history. He uses an\nairboat to pull over boats that get too close to the relics.\n\n''The majority of people know the law and understand we have to do what we\nhave to do,'' Burnsed said.\n\nHe said he's caught a few people poking around the archaeological site. One\nperson said he wasn't there for artifacts -- but for old Coke bottles.\n\n''Riiiiigggghhhhht,'' Burnsed said.\n\nBurnsed is one of about a half-dozen officers patrolling an area in Lake\nOkeechobee where newly discovered Native American artifacts are located.\nThere's already evidence of looting at the site, which is accessible only by\nairboat -- or a long, hot hike through thigh-high muck.\n\n''The people who engage in looting and trafficking are not art lovers,''\nsaid Clifford Brown, an archaeology professor at Florida Atlantic\nUniversity. ``They're crooks. And they traffic in anything they can make\nmoney on.''\n\nAnd old stuff does make money.\n\nA casual look at the online auction house eBay shows arrowheads on sale for\n$2.99 to $200. Brown said ceramics can fetch tens of thousands of dollars\nand Maya carvings can sell for hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe auction house Sotheby's set a new world record for antiquities Thursday\nwhen a bronze figure from 1 A.D., Artemis and the Stag, sold for $28.6\nmillion. A spokeswoman at the auction house said there's a rigorous process\nto ensure items sold there are not stolen.\n\nBut not everyone is as diligent.\n\n''It's where museums get their stuff as well as collectors,'' Brown said.\n\nFAMOUS FIND\n\nPerhaps the most famous case of looting involves the Elgin Marbles, taken\nfrom the Parthenon by the British diplomat Lord Elgin around 1810. They are\nhoused in the British Museum in London. Greece wants them back.\n\nBut England has argued they are better preserved in the museum.\n\nBrown said stolen antiquities are tricky to police.\n\nFor example, he said, if people are selling arrowheads dug from their back\nyards on eBay, it's OK. It's only when relics are taken from federal land\nthat it becomes a crime.\n\nThat's the case with the Lake Okeechobee site, said the state archaeologist.\n\nJust disturbing the area is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a\nyear in jail. Digging at an archaeological site is a felony and carries a\npenalty of up to five years in prison.\n\nLocal man Boots Boyer stumbled on the Lake Okeechobee site in March, when\nwater levels dipped below normal. He called county archaeologist Christian\nDavenport.\n\nSome of the artifacts discovered include a Native American shell hammer,\nsome chips of Native American pottery, a broken piece of amethyst glass\n(most likely a candleholder), bottles dating back to the early 1900s and\nshell pendants that could date back 2,000 years.\n\nDavenport also found a piece of a large ship with copper nails; a 1928\ncatfish fishing boat; a large, one-cylinder gas engine; and a steam-powered\ndredge.\n\nThe ship dates back to about 1900 and is splintered across a mile and a\nhalf, Davenport said.\n\nThere are also some bones belonging to Native Americans -- but their\npresence was previously recorded. They last surfaced after the 2001 drought.\n\nBoyer said he is also pitching in, patrolling the site on his own time.\n\n`RESPECT THE SITE'\n\n''I have a lot of respect for the site,'' Boyer said. ``I ask other people\nto please respect the site. It's our history.''\n\nHe hopes one day the artifacts will be on display in a historical museum in\nBelle Glade.\n\n''It's an awesome find,'' he said.\n\nBut even then, the objects may not be safe.\n\nOne of the largest antiquities thefts in the southern United States happened\nat the Erskine Ramsay Archaeological Repository in Alabama in 1980.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the museum's Indian artifact exhibit was stolen --\n264 items -- and never recovered.\n\nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/\n____________________________________\nMuseum Security Network\nMuseum Security Consultancy\nTon Cremers\nPostbus 3213\n3003 AE Rotterdam\n+31 10 2233897\n+31 6 242 246 20\ntoncremers@museum-security.org\n_______________________________________\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Mon, 11 Jun 2007 10:41:05 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Exhibit from British Museum reveals Egypt's secrets,\n\tbut courts controversy.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <023501c7ac04$3fed6e40$bfc84ac0$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"us-ascii\"\n\n'Mummy: The Inside Story' \nExhibit from British Museum reveals Egypt's secrets, but courts controversy \n \nSianturi Dinah Roma (DinahRS)      \n \nI first read about the Rosetta Stone in Edward Said's groundbreaking\nOrientalism (1978), in which he mentions how Napoleon Bonaparte's 1798\ncampaign in Egypt led to the stone's \"discovery\" the following year by the\nyoung engineer Pierre-Francois Bouchard. As soon as the event was announced,\nit sparked the interest of hundreds of archaeologists, collectors and\ninvestigators into Egypt's ancient civilization. \n\nAmong the scholars who had tried decoding the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta\nStone, the most significant achievement is credited to Jean-Francois\nChampollion. However, an article in the weekly Al-Ahram in November 2005\noffers a contrary opinion. The article quotes London-based Egyptian\nEgyptologist Okasha El-Dali as claiming that Arab scholars in fact decoded\nthe hieroglyphs 1,000 years earlier than Champollion.\n\nIt is interesting that the discovery of the Rosetta Stone is only one of the\nmany layers of mysteries surrounding the exploration of ancient Egypt\nitself. But how the stone ended up in the collection of the British Museum\nas its valued centerpiece since 1802 is another story that highlights the\npower struggles among European countries over the creation and possession of\nknowledge. \n\nThe British Museum's \"Mummy: The Inside Story\" has given me an insight into\nthe long and often controversial history that shrouds the collection. As a\npopular exhibit, it has attracted thousands of visitors in its run in the\nU.K. and U.S. It finally made its first visit in Asia at The National\nScience Museum of Tokyo (Oct. 7, 2006 to Feb. 2, 2007) and is now drawing to\na close at the Kobe City Museum (March 3 to June 17). In Kobe alone, the\nexhibit has already attracted more than 10,000 viewers.\n\nThematically, the 125 artifacts are divided into five sections:\n\"Introduction to the World of Ancient Egypt\", \"Serving the Gods\",\n\"Nesperennub the Priest\", \"Desire for Rebirth and Eternal Life\" and\n\"Departure to the Afterlife.\" The Rosetta Stone leads the entire collection.\n\n\nIt is overwhelming to walk through the rows of glass casings, inside of\nwhich sit many gold and bronze statuettes of gods and goddesses, chalices,\njars, miniature shrines, intricately hand-designed gold jewelries, pendants\nand amulets. An inner area in the exhibit is devoted to the artifacts of\nNesperrennub the Priest while a reconstructed head of his is displayed\nopposite the glass casing that contains a body-length diagram of where the\ntabs and pendants were placed throughout the priest's body during his\nmummification nearly 3,000 years ago. \n\nNesperrennub, who has resided in the British Museum since 1899, also takes\nthe limelight in a 20-minute 3D film projected onto a 12 foot tall and 42\nfoot wide curved screen that travels with the exhibit. The film boasts of\nthe Silicon Graphics Inc.'s (SGI) scanning technology that has distinguished\n\"The Inside Story\" from ordinary exhibits. A project that was conducted over\na two-year period, the mummy was initially scanned at a London hospital and\na follow up scan was done in Scotland using a 3D laser. The film uses high\nvisualization technology that puts together 1,500 computed tomography (CT)\nnon-invasive scans of the priest's wrappings and casings into a single data\nset. The fly-through effect was an impressive virtual reconstruction of the\npriest's face, his life, his environment in Karknak, Egypt and the very\nculture he was thought to have lived in. \n\nWhat the film is able to reveal as well, without the need to \"invade\" the\npriest's remains, is the tedious mummification process that attests to\nancient Egypt's sophisticated method of preserving the human body. Yet as\nall humans are bound to make mistakes, the film through the help of forensic\nexperts makes guesses on what the embalmers neglected during the process. A\nsmall plate attached to Nesperrennub's skull, for example, is assumed to\nhave been left there after the clay had hardened.\n\nI left the exhibit thrilled at the discovery of technology in making the\npast so alive for the individual nowadays. I have never thought that the\nwonders of antiquity can be stored in bits and images and played over and\nover again just like another song. Never before has it been so accessible.\n\nYet another great significance of the exhibit centers on the issue of the\nartifacts' possession itself. As I searched for relevant articles on the\nissue, a close friend told me to look up the name Dr. Zahi Hawass, Egypt's\nSecretary General of the Surpreme Council of Antiquities, who is now a\nstaunch advocate for the return and protection of the country's \"lost\ntreasures,\" particularly the Rosetta Stone.\n\nDr. Hawass's oft-quoted statement that aggressively asks the British to\nreturn the Rosetta Stone \"if they want to restore their reputation\" was\ndismissed by Vivian Davies, keeper of Egypt and Sudanese Antiquities of the\nBritish Museum, by saying that the Rosetta Stone is an important part of\ntheir mission to showcase not only Egyptian antiquity, but its being part of\nthe world's civilization. \n\nIt is expected that Dr. Hawass will continue to pursue ownership over\nEgypt's civilization, but whether and when the Rosetta Stone will be\nreturned only time can tell.  \n\nhttp://english.ohmynews.com/\n\n____________________________________\nMuseum Security Network\nMuseum Security Consultancy\nTon Cremers\nPostbus 3213\n3003 AE Rotterdam\n+31 10 2233897\n+31 6 242 246 20\ntoncremers@museum-security.org\n_______________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 138\n****************************************\n\n"}
