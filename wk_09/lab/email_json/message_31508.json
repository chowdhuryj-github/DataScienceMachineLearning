Libraries I would like to use in S+. So I would like to\nuse the R functions by calling on R from S+. For example export the data to\nbe used in the R calculation in a temporary txt-file, and then S+ calls on R\nto start and read the txt file. R then executes the function specified and\nthen exports the results in another txt file which then S+ uploads. Is this\npossible? Or does anyone have another solution?\n\nThanks Tom\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Is-it-possible-to-control-R-with-S%2B--tf3771485.html#a10662666\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
