But I don't\nsee any output if I use 'ls'. But isn't there a way to get the output from\nls???\n\nThe reason that I am asking this is that I will have to call one more exe\n(similar to ls, obtained from free-ware) for my Perl program and that is not\nrunning either?\n\nThanks & Regards,\nLakshmi\n952-833-1220\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Chas Owens [mailto:chas.owens@gmail.com]\nSent: Wednesday, June 13, 2007 12:35 PM\nTo: lakshmi.sailaja@supersolution.com\nCc: beginners@perl.org\nSubject: Re: Prompt in Net::Telnet\n\n\nOn 6/13/07, Lakshmi Sailaja  wrote:\n> You are right that I am trying to connect to a Windows m/c from a Solaris\n> server.\n>\n> But when I used the below code, it gets connected but I am having problem\n> displaying the output:\n>\n>\n>  my $telnet = Net::Telnet->new(HOST => \"$server\",\n>                 Dump_log => \"telnetdump.txt\",\n>                 PROMPT => '/[>]/');\n>  $telnet->login('user', 'pass');\n>  $telnet->cmd('ls -l >lsop.log');\n>\n> after running this program, lsop.log is being created but I don't see\n> anything in it.\n>\n> If I can display the output, I am all good.
