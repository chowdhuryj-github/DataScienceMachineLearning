Pod6 would be more of the syntax and basic\noperation, but other people could have custom directives that their\nPod6 translators and formatters could then use. That is, not all of\nthis has to be in the spec if the spec has a way to make it possible\nlater. :)\n\nAnd, as far as writing a new S26, does this mean that this really isn't\nopen to discussion? That is, if we want something different than you\nwant we have to have competing specs and there won't be any compromise?\n\n"}
