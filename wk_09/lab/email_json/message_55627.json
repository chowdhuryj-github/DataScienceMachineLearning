Branch\nthe 4.0 tree maxed out at a VSZ of 335MB.  Some of this may\njust be a rsult of python's garbage collection and memory\nmanagement.\n\nI would be very concerned about scaling a bzr repo with our\nexisting number of svn commits.  Granted that we coud drop\nthe svn history and that a DSCM system may not see the same\nhigh number f commits as the \"svn-commit-to-save\" pattern\nwe have here, but long term this could be a real problem.\n\nI don't want to start out with performance issues.\nAnd I don't see rsync as a valid means of initial branching.\nbzr should stand on its own without alternative means of\nobtaining the initial tree.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGgSo7IR7qMdg1EfYRAsqQAJ96zw0rKfL2q7DQSVbuewLKS0VAygCfcAZy\nM4j/kQXEj25fbfOcWbatYlw=\n=yBpo\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
