There were certainly a lot of things to overcome, but in spite of all those surprises we managed to do what we always do and meet our mission objectives and have a successful mission.\"\n\nThe space station has a new look with the retraction of the P6-2B solar panel and installation of the new S3/S4 solar array truss segment on the right side of the lab's main solar power truss. The station now sports two huge solar panels mounted on each end of the power truss, slowly rotating like giant paddle wheels to track the sun.\n\nFlight controllers will get a chance to take in the station's new look during a one-lap fly-around by Atlantis after undocking to photograph the outpost from different angles.\n\nFlight controllers successfully tested the station's orientation control system Monday to make sure revived computers in the Russian segment of the lab complex will be able to keep the outpost properly oriented after Atlantis departs. There were no problems and while troubleshooting continues to find the original cause of the computer problems, engineers are confident the system is healthy.\n\n\"The international space station right now is in very, very good shape,\" Ridings said. \"The other thing we did yesterday was do our test on the Russian thrusters, both with the (Russian) terminal computer controlling as the brains of the operation and then the U.S. navigation computer controlling it. Both of those activities went nominal, there were no problems, no issues.\n\n\"We should expect it to work just fine today,\" she said. \"We certainly still have a lot of work to do in terms of the root cause, but as far as getting everything back up and running, we're very, very comfortable those systems and processes are on line and running properly.\"\n\nUndocking is expected at 10:42 a.m. Here is an updated timeline of today's activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; includes rev. O of the NASA television schedule):\n\n\nDATE/EDT...DD...HH...MM...EVENT\n\n06/19/07\n\n06:38 AM...10...11...00...STS/ISS crew wakeup\n08:43 AM...10...13...05...Group C computer powerup\n08:58 AM...10...13...20...Group B computer powerup\n09:28 AM...10...13...50...Centerline camera installation\n09:31 AM...10...13...53...Sunrise\n09:53 AM...10...14...15...U.S. arrays feathered\n09:59 AM...10...14...21...Noon\n10:26 AM...10...14...48...Sunset\n10:27 AM...10...14...49...Last Russian ground station loss of signal\n10:37 AM...10...14...59...Russian arrays feathered\n10:42 AM...10...15...04...UNDOCKING\n10:43 AM...10...15...05...Initial orbiter separation (+10 seconds)\n10:44 AM...10...15...06...ISS holds current attitude\n10:47 AM...10...15...09...Range: 50 feet; reselect -X jets\n10:49 AM...10...15...11...Range: 75 feet; low-Z jets\n10:50 AM...10...15...12...Russian arrays resume auto sun tracking\n11:02 AM...10...15...24...Sunrise\n11:11 AM...10...15...33...Range: 400 feet; start flyaround\n11:21 AM...10...15...43...Range: 600 feet\n11:23 AM...10...15...45...Shuttle directly above ISS\n11:24 AM...10...15...46...ISS maneuvers to XVV TEA\n11:29 AM...10...15...51...U.S. arrays resume sun auto track\n11:30 AM...10...15...52...Noon\n11:34 AM...10...15...56...Shuttle directly behind ISS\n11:46 AM...10...16...08...Shuttle directly below ISS\n11:57 AM...10...16...19...Separation burn No. 1\n11:58 AM...10...16...20...Sunset\n12:23 PM...10...16...45...PMA-2 depressurization\n12:25 PM...10...16...47...Separation burn No. 2\n12:28 PM...10...16...50...Group B computer powerdown\n12:28 PM...10...16...50...Shuttle robot arm powerup\n12:58 PM...10...17...20...Crew meals begin\n01:58 PM...10...18...20...Heat shield inspection boom unberth\n02:43 PM...10...19...05...Starboard wing survey\n03:58 PM...10...20...20...Nose cap survey\n04:28 PM...10...20...50...EVA unpack and stow\n04:58 PM...10...21...20...Port wing survey\n04:58 PM...10...21...20...Post EVA entry prep\n05:00 PM...10...21...22...Mission status briefing on NTV\n06:18 PM...10...22...40...Inspection boom berthing\n06:53 PM...10...23...15...Robot arm powerdown\n06:53 PM...10...23...15...Orbit adjust rocket firing window\n10:08 PM...11...02...30...STS crew sleep begins\n11:00 PM...11...03...22...Daily video highlights reel on NTV\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
