Like it or not, most scientists store their  \nexperimental data in MS-Excel spreadsheets, and one needs to be able  \nto handle them.... It turned out to be a lot easier to write a  \nfunction for R to read in XLS data than to train our users to convert  \ntheir data to .csv format.\n\n-G\n(author of the gdata package)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
