It's breaking my head.\n\nPerl doesn't require the braces to be escaped. As it is the regex is matching literal\nbraces in the string which don't exist. Try this:\n\n  if ($line =~ /[[:digit:]]{1,3}\\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}\\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}\\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}/) {\n    :\n  }\n\nand, by the way, [0-9] is more concise than [[:digit:]].\n\nHTH,\n\nRob\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
