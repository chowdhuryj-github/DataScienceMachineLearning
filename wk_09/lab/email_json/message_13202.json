Why should\nwe protect goodwill in one narrow way while allowing it to slip away in\nanother more widespread way?\n\nI believe gambling debian goodwill on our derivatives is less dangerous\nthan the current gambling of debian goodwill on unethical merchandise.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
