Apparently most distros have pam but slack does\nnot. Not sure how much it complicates thing altogether but for\ngetting vmware working, once it was configured properly it \nwas not a problem at all for me. PAM is an authentication \nsystem, so yes it does complicate authentication. Vmware \nuses it for authenticating access to those vmware processes\nover that funky local network it creates. More info on pam\nhere\n\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/\n\nI don't know much about gnome because I've been very \ninterested in it.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\nZach wrote:\n I've heard some technical complaints about Dropline.  One of those \nseems to be that it installs PAM, which isn't really something I'm \nfamiliar with.  From what I gather, it complicates traditional ways of \ndoing things considerably.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
