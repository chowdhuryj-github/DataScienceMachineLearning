The \nfirst example ends \"summary(house.plr)\".  The print of this summary \nincludes standard errors.  If you want those numbers for subsequent \ncomputations, you can try str(summary(house.plr)) or \nnames(summary(house.plr)).  If you want to be more sophisticated, \nclass(summary(house.plr)) says it is \"summary.polr\".  Then  \nmethods(class=\"summary.polr\") says there exists a function \n'print.summary.polr', which is however, 'invisible'.  If you want to see \nit, \"getAnywhere('print.summary.polr')\" will produce the code. \n\n      If this does NOT answer your question, please provide commented, \nminimal, self-contained, reproducible code, as requested in the posting \nguide \"www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\". \n\n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n\nadschai@optonline.net wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> I obtained all the coefficients that I need from polr. However, I'm wondering how I can obtain the standard error of each estimated coefficient? I saved the Hessian and do something like summary(polrObj), I don't see any standard error like when doing regression using lm. Any help would be really appreciated.
