I like it's equipped with many I/O. \n\nHere are the specs\n looks like it runs an onboard Intel GMA950 graphic chip but does it have any seperate graphic mem ? They only mention shared one.\n\nHere's a review\n\n\nAnyway, if you got one please drop a note on  http://www.linux-laptop.net your model isn't in yet.\nPersonally i would be interested in your opinion concerning screen glare.\n\n(ps. lookup \"dual channel mode\" RAM and consider to upgrade to 2x1G)\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
