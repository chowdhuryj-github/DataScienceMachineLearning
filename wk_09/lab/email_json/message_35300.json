'@@x' would then bind to any object that does 'sigil:<@@>'.\n\n> If we have a multidim role, don't make it do positional.  Those can\n> only be combined on a case by case basis.

That said, you have a point, in that '@@' vs. '@' is a\nstrange dog; an object that is bound to '@@' behaves differently than\none that's bound to '@', which would not be the case if we relied\nsolely on something to the effect of 'sigil:<@@> does sigil:<@>' to\nhandle matters.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
