What it does buy is that the *unquoted*  \nnotation works:  the definition of Perl6's grammar turns out to lead  \nto `-f' and `- f' parsing identically because tokens must be composed  \nof characters all from the same group (e.g. alphanumeric, or  \npunctuation, etc.), which causes problems.  Larry's fix was to switch  \nto adverbial form, and modify the way they were used to fit the  \nadverbial paradigm.\n\n-- \nbrandon s. allbery  [solaris,freebsd,perl,pugs,haskell]   \nallbery@kf8nh.com\nsystem administrator  [openafs,heimdal,too many hats]   \nallbery@ece.cmu.edu\nelectrical and computer engineering, carnegie mellon university       \nKF8NH\n\n\n"}
