Or is placing the invariant pages in a separate manpage not an\nextract of GFDL documentation? Seems to me that it *is* an extract and\nthat supplying both gcc (1) and fsf-funding (7) adheres to the GFDL.\nIndeed, this almost the path that OpenBSD has followed too.\n\nThere's no practical benefit from removing an insignifcantly small\ninvariant section from a large document except for a desire to not\ndistribute FSF propaganda. If you create a small excerpt from a large\nGFDL document, you can probably omit the invariant section per Fair\nUse policies.\n\nThis isn't a real problem. The FSF isn't going to be enacting legal\naction against OpenBSD or all the other distros who created a gcc\nmanpage from the info docs. Debian decided to make it a problem for\nitself and for its users.\n\n- Jordi G. H.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
