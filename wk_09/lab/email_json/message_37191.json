If not, it is not\navailable. Which synth do you use? If you want a synth other then flite,\nwhich is standard on the CD, you must set it up manually.\nNote: The grml team included espeak into the package, and in English it\nworks well, although there are some problems with other languages (I\ninformed the team).\nHermann\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
