I currently have a a list set up to store\nthe outputs from the function and a plot of one of them (a set of\nordered pairs) like this:\n\nfoo<-function(x,y,z){\n## do some work here ##\nlist(x=x,y=y,z=z,output1=output1,output2=output2,\n     plot=plot(output1[,1],output1[,2],type=p));\n}\n\nThe problem I am having is that when I do\n\n>work<-foo(x,y,z)\n>work\n\nit will show the plot, but I would like to be able to repeatedly call it\nlike I can call the different plots in an lm without having to display\neverything else too (in some cases, output1 could be a 50K by 2 matrix,\nrather inconvenient to keep having it display that over and over again\nto get a graph).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJason Q.
