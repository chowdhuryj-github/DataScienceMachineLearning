If you have in mind an\nR^2-like measure; you can always use 1 -\nerror-variance/variance-of-endogenous-variable, but this is not guaranteed\nto be positive.\n\n> (3) If I would like to diagnostic of model selection, says \n> use AIC criteria, it is a bit unclear for me how I can apply \n> this on structural equation model as it is composed of \n> multiple equations rather than one.

On the other hand, sem() fits by full-information\nmaximum-likelihood (FIML). It prints out the BIC; you could compute the AIC\nif you liked.\n\nJohn\n\n> Any help would be really appreciated.
