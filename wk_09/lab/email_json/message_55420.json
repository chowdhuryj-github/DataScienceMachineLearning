I tried the\n\"hibernate\" package, which someone suggested, and everything works fine,now. I recall there were a couple of changes to the config that I wastold to make, but I think hibernate fixed the problem even without those\nchanges.Try \"hibernate\" first. If that doesn't work, then I can go find thechanges I made.One thing you probably do have to do is change one config file in/etc/hibernate. There's a config file which basically lists the types of\nhibernation to try and in what order. It's something like:\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/ram.conf\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/sysfs-ram.conf\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/ususpend-ram.conf\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/disk.conf\n\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/sysfs-disk.conf\u00a0\u00a0 Load /etc/hibernate/ususpend-disk.confOr something like that. You can rearrange them to alter what orderthey're tried in. You can probably also just use the \"hibernate-disk\"\nand \"hibernate-ram\" commands.- JoeHi all,\n\nThanks for your replies.\n\nBhaskar: I cannot switch to the terminal with Alt+F1 or any other virtual terminal for that.\n\nKevin: I used the raw (low-level) program s2disk and s2ram for it but\nthey do the same thing as the powersave script, which additionally\nremoves some kernel modules. \n\nJoe: I installed hibernate, but with the same result. May be you can suggest me the configs you made for making it work for you. regards,Hardik \n"}
