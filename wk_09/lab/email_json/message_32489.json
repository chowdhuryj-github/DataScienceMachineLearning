All went well and, as well as my previous cut and paste problems, \nthe upgrade fixed some previous sound card problems I was having.  The \nnew problems came in when he tried to change my default sound card from my \nEnsoniq card to my Soundblaster Live card.  He followed the instructions \nin the Debian and alsa how-tos.  However, the system will now not load up \nthe sound card drivers and will not record.  The arecord error is:\n3:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default\narecord: main:550: audio open error: No such device\n\nDoes anyone have some experience and/or ideas on what we can do? My first \npriority is to just have both cards working again.  And then having the SB \nLive as default would be a bonus.\n\nThanks all.\n\nAmanda\n\n--\nAmanda Tink: Email/MSN amanda@amandatink.net\nOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
