Inside a panel function,\npacket.number() will give you the packet number in sequential order\n(column major order if you think of the conditioning variables as\ndefining a multiway cross-tabulation), and which.packet() will give\nyou a vector with the current level of each conditioning variable. You\ncan use these to extract the appropriate subset of points.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
