Please post the output of the following three commands:\n\n\n> cat /etc/debian_version\n4.0\n\n\n> uname -a\nLinux Notebook 2.6.8-2-386 # thu May 19 17:40:50 JST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux\n\n> dpkg -l aptitude libc6 xorg | tail -n 3\nii aptitude       0.4.4-4         terminal-based apt frontend\nii libc6             2.3.6.ds1-13    GNU C Library: Shared libraries\nii xorg              7.1.0-16          X.Org X Window System\n\n> What you say sounds like you tried to upgrade from Sarge to Etch, but we\n> need to know for sure.\n\nmm....sound like that, also seems like my kernel is for 386 but the\nsystem is a i686\ni dunno anything about that\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
