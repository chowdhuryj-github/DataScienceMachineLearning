E.g. by creating\na monthplot via the result of the stl() method it looks ok> but I was\nwondering whether there exist other methods to plot the different years\nas lines on top of each other such that years can be compared with each\nother (temporal change detection)?\n\n \n\nThis is the type of time-series we are working with:\n\nforest <- ts(data, frequency=46, start=c(2000,8), end=c(2006,46))\n\n \n\nI tried it as follows but this is not very clear.\n\nyear0 <- window(forest, start=2000,end=c(2000,46))\n\nyear1 <- window(forest, start=2001,end=c(2001,46))\n\nyear2 <- window(forest, start=2002,end=c(2002,46))\n\nyear3 <- window(forest, start=2003,end=c(2003,46))\n\nyear4 <- window(forest, start=2004,end=c(2004,46))\n\nyear5 <- window(forest, start=2005,end=c(2005,46))\n\nyear6 <- window(forest, start=2006,end=c(2006,46))\n\n \n\nplot(1:46,years[,1], col=2)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,2], col=3)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,3], col=4)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,4], col=5)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,5], col=6)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,6], col=7)\n\nlines(1:46,years[,7], col=8)\n\n \n\nAre there other options to be able to compare years with each other in\norder to detect change (e.g., per month)?\n\n \n\nThanks a lot,\n\nJ\n\n \n\nR 2.5, Win XP \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
