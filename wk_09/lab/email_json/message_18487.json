Meanwhile, the synthesis of neuroprotectin D1\n(NPD1), an endogenous DHA-derived messenger, is upregulated. All of the\nparticipants were white and none of them had problems, such as broken\nbones, that could affect the results. Based on these findings, the Dutch\nteam say late-onset dementia shows clear associations with both\nstructural brain damage and decreased cerebral blood flow. \"See more\narticles and news on resveratrolTrack news on Alzheimer's at\nDiseaseWatch.

Insulin is the hormone which allows sugars to enter your cells to\nbe used as fuel or stored as fat if they are not burned off. \"The\nfindings emphasize the importance of monitoring both high and low blood\npressure in older adults,\" Dr.\nBut researchers found that the late-onset dementia group also had a much\nlower rate of blood flow to the brain than the other two groups.

The researchers looked at what\npercentage of participants' diets contained antioxidant vitamins (E, C,\ncarotenoids) and B vitamins (folate, B-6, and B-12). \"Green tea contains\nmany antioxidants, including those known as flavonoids that can protect\nagainst free radical damage to the brain.
