You are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause.\n\nIt's good to be clever, but not to show it.\n\nDecide that you really want to achieve the goal...\n\nNo one as ever completed their apprenticeship.\n\nNever underestimate your problem or your ability to deal with it.\n\nIf you take all the experience and judgment of men over fifty out of the world, there wouldn't be enough left to run it.\n\nIt is a wise father that knows his own child.\n\nMan should forget his anger before he lies down to sleep.\n\nIf you wish to be loved Love!\n\nThose whom true love has held, it will go on holding.\n\nEducation is what you get from reading the fine print. Experience is what you get from not reading it.\n\nYou can set yourself up to be sick, or you can choose to stay well.\n\nSimply the thing I am shall make me live.\n\n\n"}
