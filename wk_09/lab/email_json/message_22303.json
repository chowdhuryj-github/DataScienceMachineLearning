I believe that patch pressure\nis getting high but maybe this is just from my own need to\nstart clearing out winbindd changes.\n\nThe reason I'm branching from SAMBA_3_0_25 and now SAMBA_3_0\nis that we still don't want the CIFS data encryption work\nthat Jeremy is doing, not the full PIDL/libndr files.  These\nare the only major features in SAMBA_3_0 that are not in\nSAMBA_3_0_25.\n\nOnce the branch is done.  We'll have about 4 weeks of major\nchanges and then will start locking down for another release\napproximately one month after the feature freeze.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGOfatIR7qMdg1EfYRAgxoAJ9bqx/zpiMyCLv8gaeisu2vqG4d3QCfX+/U\nliCONXDoJU3bK9Y0vd+c7Kc=\n=vya9\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
