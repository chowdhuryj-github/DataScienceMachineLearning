If yes, read this letter to the end since it contains the information you will definitely find useful.\n\"High price proves the high quality of the drug\" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.\nCanadianPharmacy 100% safety at the lowest price you've ever seen. Only generic drugs on sale.\nYours faithfully,Jonathon Earl\n\n\n\n\n"}
