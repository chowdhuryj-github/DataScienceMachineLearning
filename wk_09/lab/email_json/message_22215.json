Here's how to remedy that situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does Data Execution Prevention work?\n\n\n\nData Execution Prevention aims to protect your computer by making it \nharder for hackers to silently execute their programs in your PC.\n\nAs Windows runs, its Virtual Memory Manager maps addresses in RAM to \nlocations on the hard disk (in the pagefile or swapfile). At the same time, \nhardware DEP inserts a special bit into the disk version of an address, \nmarking it as non-executable.\n\nIf a hacker program attempts to write code to \nsuch a location and then execute it, a DEP-enabled processor detects the \nexploit and registers an error. If so, Windows can shut down the problem \napplication or, if the hacked code is in an area used by Windows, halt a \nportion of the operating system itself.\n\nWindows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) has a software-only version of DEP, \nwhich is not as effective as the hardware version. Fortunately, Vista \nprovides support for both software DEP and hardware DEP. In either \ncase, you'll want to turn on those DEP settings that you can benefit from. \nVista users should read on, while XP users can skip down to the section \nentitled \"Turning on DEP.\"\n\n\n\nDoes my system support DEP?\n\n\n\nFollow the steps below to find out if \nthe processor in your Vista computer supports hardware DEP:\nStep 1. In Vista's Windows Explorer application, launch the \nSystem Properties dialog box by right-clicking Computer in \nExplorer's folder list.\nStep 2. Choose Properties, \nor launch the System icon in Control Panel's System and \nMaintenance category.\nStep 3. Click Advanced System Settings in the task bar on the left.\nStep 4. Click Continue, if prompted by User Account Control.\nStep 5. Under Performance, click Settings.\nStep 6. In the Performance Options dialog box, click the \nData Execution Prevention tab. If your processor supports this feature, a \nsentence to that effect appears in the lower part of the dialog box.\n\nHere's a fast way to get to the same dialog box using only the keyboard, \nwith minimal mouse clicking:\nStep 1. In Vista, press Win+R to open the Run dialog box.\nStep 2. Type SystemPropertiesDataExecutionPrevention \nand press Enter.\nStep 3. Click Continue, if prompted by User Account Control.\n\n\n\nAre all of my applications using DEP?\n\n\n\nAs the Performance Options dialog box suggests, DEP is turned on by default \nfor most Windows services and programs \u2014 but not all. Vista users \ncan see which applications aren't covered by taking these \nsteps:\nStep 1. Right-click an empty area of the taskbar and choose Task \nManager (or press Ctrl+Shift+Esc).\nStep 2. Click the Processes tab and choose View, Select \nColumns.\nStep 3. Scroll to the bottom of the Select Process Page Columns \ndialog box and check Data Execution Prevention.\nStep 4. Click OK.\n\nThe new column shows you which processes have DEP enabled (most \nof them) and which do not \u2014 notably Explorer (explorer.exe) \nand Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe). If you happen to have Windows \nMedia Player (wmplayer.exe) or Outlook 2007 (outlook.exe)\nrunning, you'll notice DEP is disabled for these applications as well. \nYou may also see some IE plug-ins listed here, like Java \n(jusched.exe) or the Google toolbar \n(GoogleToolbarNotifier.exe).\n\nFigure 1. Windows Task Manager can show you which applications are \nusing DEP.\n\nIf DEP is so useful, why is it disabled for important applications like \nOutlook 2007 and IE 7? The answer is that many developers disable DEP \nto maintain backward compatibility with other products, such as add-ons or \nplug-ins. For example, although plug-ins such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader \nand Flash Player now work with DEP enabled for IE, as of this writing, \nthe Google toolbar and Sun Microsystem's Java plug-in do not.\n\n\n\nHow to turn on DEP\n\n\n\nBoth Vista and XP let you turn on DEP globally, while allowing you to make \nexceptions for applications that have problems.\nTo do that, you need to return to the Performance Options dialog:\n\nIn Vista, click Start, type \nSystemPropertiesDataExecutionPrevention, and press Enter. \nClick Continue in the User Account Control dialog box.\n\nIn XP, click Start, Run, then type sysdm.cpl and press Enter. \nClick the Advanced tab. In the Performance box, click Settings. \nClick the Data Execution Prevention tab.\n\nIn both XP and Vista, select Turn on DEP for all programs and services \nexcept those I select.\n\nIn Vista only, take time now to specify a few of the programs you saw \nlisted in Task Manager earlier to keep DEP disabled for them. To do that, \nclick Add and browse for the .exe file of a program you know \nnormally does not use DEP (for example, explorer.exe, wmplayer.exe, \noutlook.exe). Select the filename and click Open. Click OK to \nacknowledge the risk of turning off DEP for that application. Repeat \nfor each application that normally doesn't use DEP.\n\nThe strategy here is to enable DEP for these applications one at a time \nover an extended period to see if they can live with this feature. Start \nby unchecking one of the boxes for an app you added to the exception list. \nClick OK (and OK again to acknowledge the restart \nprompt) and restart your system. If the unchecked application runs well for a \nfew days, return to the Performance Options dialog box, and uncheck another \napp. Repeat until everything is running with DEP \u2014 or until you find \none or more apps that need DEP disabled to run properly.\n\nFigure 2. Use the Performance Options dialog to add exceptions to your DEP settings.\n\nXP users have no way to spot applications that don't use DEP by default, \nbut they can start with Outlook 2007 and Windows Media Player 11. If \nWindows closes an application with a Data Execution Prevention error message \n(or any serious error on a regular basis), you can add that application \nto the exclusion list, as explained above. If you're lucky, the error message \nwill contain a Change Settings button to get you to the dialog box more \nquickly.\n\nNote that the Data Execution Prevention tab of the Performance Options dialog \nbox only lets you adjust DEP settings for 32-bit applications. If you have \nthe 64-bit version of Vista installed (which can run both 32- and 64-bit \napps), you're covered: Windows applies DEP to all 64-bit services and \nprograms. In fact, if you try to add a 64-bit application to the exclusion \nlist, Vista displays an error telling you it can't be done.\n\n\n\nWorking around the IE exception\n\n\n\nContrary to what you might expect, one type of program in particular \nignores the settings in the Data Execution Prevention tab \u2014 namely, \nbrowsers such as Internet Explorer 7. The only way to enable DEP for IE 7 \nis in the Internet Options control panel in Vista. XP users apparently \nhave no way to activate DEP for IE 7.\n\nTo get a DEP-enabled IE browser in Vista, begin by disabling most or all \nof your IE add-ons. From the IE command bar, choose Tools, Manage Add-ons, \nEnable or Disable Add-ons. In the Manage Add-ons dialog box, select a \nhelper application in the list and click the Disable button below. Repeat \nfor all items in the list, except those you know to be safe (such as \nAdobe Acrobat and Flash). Click OK.\n\nNow let's turn on DEP for Internet Explorer:\nStep 1.  Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl, and press \nCtrl+Shift+Enter to open the dialog with administrative privileges. \n(If you don't run this dialog as an administrator, the option in question \nwill be greyed out.)\nStep 2. Click Continue in the User Account Control prompt.\nStep 3. Click the Advanced tab and scroll to the bottom of the \nSettings list.\nStep 4. Check Enable memory protection to mitigate online \nattacks.\nStep 5. Click OK.\n\nNow, restart Internet Explorer (if it was running). If everything seems to go \nsmoothly, return to the Manage Add-ons dialog box. Enable one of the plug-ins, \nclick OK, and restart IE again.\n\nAs with the applications you specified earlier, you'll want to use IE for a \nwhile to make sure everything works as desired. If IE won't start or you see \nerrors with some Web sites, you may need to disable the problem plug-in. \nIf you can't live without a DEP-intolerant plug-in, you may have to turn off \nDEP for IE altogether.\n\n\n\nOther apps that are DEP exceptions\n\n\n\nIE 7 is not the only program that ignores Windows global DEP settings. \nEven with DEP turned on globally, Task Manager shows that neither Mozilla \nFirefox nor Opera support DEP.\n\nIf DEP is important to your sense of \nInternet security, IE 7 is the only major browser that supports it \n\u2014 until the other applications provide support for this feature.\n\n\n\nManaging installer and application problems\n\n\n\nAlthough the DEP is supposed to display a message \nindicating when it has shut down an errant program, some sources claim that \nthe messages don't always appear, and that DEP can sometimes even prevent \nprograms (especially installers) from launching. These sources go so far as \nto recommend turning off DEP entirely.\n\nSuch advice is like throwing out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. \nIf you do have problems with applications that end abnormally or won't run, \nyou can always return to the Performance Options dialog to turn off DEP \ntemporarily as a test. This can help you get your software installed, for \nexample, if an installer won't run.\n\nOverall, you're much better \noff making exceptions for a few problem programs (and reporting the \ndifficulty to the manufacturer) than shutting down DEP entirely.\n\nFinally, you should look at DEP as only one weapon in your security arsenal. DEP \nadds an important layer of protection, but it isn't a reason to give up your other \nsecurity tools.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

Windows Secrets contributing editor Susan \nBradley sent her own take on this line of thought:\n\n\n\"Over the last couple of newsletters, several ways to cheaply upgrade to \nVista have been discussed. However, the best and cheapest way to 'upgrade' \nor 'buy' Vista is still the way my sister bought her Vista operating \nsystem. She bought it preinstalled on a computer, with the proper drivers \nalready included.\n\n\"OEM licenses aren't legal for the average computer user to purchase and \nuse to install on existing computers. Most of us can't legally buy or \ninstall this software on our computer systems because we aren't system \nbuilders. OEM software by definition is 'original equipment manufacturer' \nsoftware and is licensed to system builders to install and bundle on, \ntypically, new systems.\n\n\"You can read the EULA for the OEM software that I \ncopied on my Web site. \nWhen you purchase OEM software, you are stating that you \nare a 'system builder' of computer devices, that is, you are a  \nmanufacturer of computer equipment. You also certify that you will provide \nall support for that system. And, you need to affix a Certificate of \nAuthority to the system.\n\n\"The bottom line is that unless your name is Michael Dell, chances are \nmost of us aren't system builders. Therefore, it's not legal for us to \nbuy OEM software and use that license to install it on our \nsystems.\"\n\n\nThe purpose of my story was to report on the savings advertised by a \nnumber of online retailers (including reputable dealers like Amazon.com) via \nOEM or System Builder software. As Susan points out, however, some retailers \nmay be violating Microsoft's OEM license when they fail to sell the product \nwith a fully assembled computer system. Microsoft changed its OEM license \nin September 2005 to add this requirement, as described in a \n Microsoft blog post.\n\nIn addition, OEM versions of Microsoft software can only be sold by \n\"authorized dealers\", found on a \n Microsoft list (this link requires IE), to \"system builders,\" who are \nrequired to register with the \n Microsoft Partner Program. This language leaves little room for a \nhome user to take advantage of these discounts while still complying \nwith the license agreement.\n\nLet me be clear that I do not encourage anyone to break the law or behave \nunethically by violating software license agreements. My story reported the \nfact that a large number of online stores do sell OEM versions of software. \nThese sales attract customers, some of whom may not understand the legal \ndetails or choose to ignore them.\n\n\n\nSome academic software is different than retail\n\n\n\nOEM discounts aren't the only complicated subject in the software \nmarketplace. A reader named David points out that not all academic \nsoftware is created equal:\n\n\n\n\"Student versions of software vary widely in their restrictions. Macromedia, \nfor example, used to limit the size of projects in Director and put a 'bug' \n[logo] on the output to indicate it was produced by a student version so it \ncouldn't be used for commercial projects.\n\n\"Adobe, on the other hand, has been easier. I got my first copy of Photoshop \nas a 'student OEM' version with no handicaps and have not had \nany upgrade issues since. It was 25% of the cost of retail.\n\n\"Other products may block professional output formats or limit the number \nof projects produced. So, do your research to see what your best value really \nis. Typically, upgrades are the same cost for everyone, so if offering a \ndiscounted version gets you started with them, vendors are happy to support \nit.\"\n\n\nBecause Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, I wouldn't expect to see these \nkinds of restrictions in Director anymore. But David's \npoint is still an excellent one: do your research on a particular discounted \nproduct before you buy it.\n\n\n\nAn educational way to get software gratis\n\n\n\nOther readers wrote in with more ways and \nplaces to get software discounts. Karl Poehleman clues us in to another \neducational discount option:\n\n\n\n\"Your discounted software finds are all very nice, but you left out an \nalternative \u2014 free! As in free Microsoft software from Microsoft \nAcademic Alliance. All one needs to do is take a computer-related class \nat a local community college (or other qualified educational outlet), \nand then voil\u00e0 \u2014 free software!\n\n\"Sure, you can buy it discounted there as well, but I picked up copies \nof Vista Business, XP Pro, Access 2007, Visio Pro, and more for nada, \nzip, zero. The software itself needs to be downloaded, or in some cases \nchecked out for copy (so you need to have a burner, or in the case of \nVista, a DVD burner). This is a great option that deserves \nmention.\"\n\n\nThe program Karl identifies is formally known as the\n MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) Academic Alliance. It makes \nsoftware available to qualifying institutions and their faculty and students \nfor instructional purposes or noncommercial research. The program's \nEULA \nspecifically rules out commercial use. The license has some other quirks, such \nas requiring that operating systems obtained under this program be installed \nonly on computers that do not have an OS at the time of installation.\n\n\nBecause of the emphasis on software development, the program does not \ninclude products such as Microsoft Office, but it does include some \nMicrosoft operating systems, as Karl mentions. Some schools may not \ninclude the software with the enrollment fee, so check with \nyour local educational institution about policies and pricing.\n\n\n\nFind academic discounts in Australia, too\n\n\n\nTo help academic readers in Australia, reader \nSam McCleary chimes in with some sites that offer educational discounts in the \nland down under:\n\n\n\n\"After reading your article on academic pricing, I thought I'd add my \ntwo-cents worth and tell you where to get discounted educational software \nin Australia. SI Group sells discounted \nMicrosoft and \nAdobe software to students \nof an accredited academic institution.\"\n\n\nThanks for the tip, Sam!\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.
