My fault.  I've rebuilt the mirror bzr tree\n    from scratch which means that you will have to rebranch and\n    merge any local changes.  Sorry.  Had to be done.\n\n(b) I've reworked the mirror scripts\n    (http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/slag/scripts/) to be\n    a little quicker and so the updates are pushed out\n    once per hour now.  I might be able to squeeze that down\n    to twice an hour if really necessary.  Probably no more\n    than that without using post-commit hooks in the svn\n    repo itself (which I don't really want to do).\n\n(c) A couple of bzr trees had missed some changes (SAMBA_4_0\n    & SAMBA_3_0_25).  I manually synced back into shape.\n\n(d) I'm posting new tarballs of the SAMBA_3_0 and SAMBA_4_0 bzr\n    tree so you don't have to branch pull or branch to get a\n    local copy.  See http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/bzr.\n    More details on available SCM tools can be found at\n    http://wiki.samba.org/.\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGRgl8IR7qMdg1EfYRAg66AKDqs3743v5TnhHx//GZo1IELhfgMACguMhf\ncMiJXBQ31goAH6vHbr/tLh4=\n=T+v4\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
