I was wondering if there is an easy way to make it fill a symmetric matrix. I have to do it several times, hence some efficient approach would be very useful.\n\nMany thanks and best wishes,\nRanjan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
