To get the captured\nstring put the regex in list context:\n\n  my ($fileName) = $path =~ /.*\\/(.+)$/;\n\nBut it would still fail if there was no slash in the $path string. You\nmay want to use the slightly simpler\n\n  my ($name) = $path =~ m|([^/]+)$|;\n\nwhich just grabs all the characters at the end of the string that aren't\nslashes, and works whether or not there is a path as well as a file name\nin the string.\n\nCheers,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
