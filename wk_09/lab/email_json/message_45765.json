Role\nTo: Ton Cremers \nMessage-ID: \nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nNew York Times, June 9, 2007\n\nAntiquities Trial Fixes on Collectors? Role\nBy ELISABETTA POVOLEDO\n\nROME, June 8 ? It was a ?sophisticated method of laundering,? a prosecution\nwitness testified on Friday in a trial courtroom here. Private collectors\nwould acquire looted artifacts and eventually donate them to museums, she\nsaid.\n\nThe witness, Daniela Rizzo, an Italian archaeologist, specifically cited the\nowners of four American antiquities collections.\n\nNone are on trial here. None have been legally charged with any wrongdoing.\nNor do Italian prosecutors contend that the collectors had evidence that\ncertain objects had been looted. Yet the prosecutors have clearly adopted a\nstrategy of calling attention to collectors, especially well-heeled\nAmericans, with the implicit message that every player in the global\nantiquities trade is within their sights.\n\nThe actual trial defendants are Marion True, a former antiquities curator at\nthe J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and Robert Hecht, an American\ndealer in classical artifacts. Both are charged with trafficking in objects\nthat were illicitly excavated from Italian soil.\n\nDozens of witnesses have filed through the courtroom since the trial opened\nin November 2005, but only this month did prosecutors fully turn their\nsights on American antiquities collectors in court testimony. The tactic has\ninfuriated defense lawyers, whose objections became so heated on Friday that\nJudge Gustavo Barbalinardo decided to suspend the proceedings until tempers\ncooled. \n\nIn her testimony Ms. Rizzo said that the ?very rich? private collectors\nbuilt collections that ?included objects that were undoubtedly looted from\nItaly.? \n\nShe cited the Texas oilmen Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt (who\nsold their artifacts at auction in 1990 after their fortunes collapsed); the\nNew York diamond merchant Maurice Tempelsman; the art philanthropist\nLawrence Fleischman and his wife, Barbara; and the financier Leon Levy and\nhis wife, Shelby White.\n\nObjects from their collections went on display in major exhibitions,\n?becoming known to the public and the scientific world, after which they\nended up in museums,? Ms. Rizzo said. ?It was a different, more\nsophisticated method of laundering artifacts.?\n\nDefense lawyers for Ms. True and Mr. Hecht repeatedly interrupted Ms.\nRizzo?s testimony; Francesco Isolabella, a lawyer for Ms. True, objected\nthat it was beyond Ms. Rizzo?s mandate to ?come up with inductive or\ndeductive theories.? Mr. Isolabella said that the archaeologist was making\n?evaluations that only a prosecutor can make.?\n\n?She should stick to identifying Etruscan vases,? Mr. Isolabella said.\n\nBecause they are not on trial, none of the collectors are represented in the\ncourtroom. Contacted through their offices, Nelson Bunker Hunt and Mr.\nTempelsman declined to comment on the trial or to be interviewed. Through a\nspokesman, Ms. White declined to comment on the trial. (Her husband died in\n2003.) In a telephone interview from New York, Ms. Fleischman said: ?It\nseems like anyone can accuse anyone of anything without any proof. We\ncollected for the pure joy of the object.? She declined to comment further\non the trial. But she said that she and her husband, who died in 1997, never\nsuspected that they might be buying anything less than legitimate.\n\nMs. Fleishman, a former Getty trustee, and her husband donated or sold more\nthan 300 antiquities to the Getty. Italy?s Culture Ministry is demanding\nthat the museum return a dozen of the Fleischman objects.\n\nIt seems inevitable that as prosecutors began investigating the passage of\nobjects from looted tombs in the Italian countryside to American\ninstitutions, they would become interested in private donors, long the\nlifeblood of the world?s museums.\n\nA report this year by the Association of Art Museum Directors, which\nrepresents nearly 200 museums in the United States, Canada and Mexico, notes\nthat ?more than 90 percent of the art collections held in public trust by\nAmerican?s art museums were donated by private individuals.?\n\nBeyond altruism, the economic benefit for collectors in the United States is\na tax deduction equal to the current market value of the object. This\ndeduction can save the donor 25 to 50 percent of the object?s value,\ndepending on what method is used. In return, museums short of funds can\naspire to top-rate works of art.\n\n?There?s every reason to think that a museum would bring an item it can?t\nafford to the attention of a collector, hoping for a donation,? said Patty\nGerstenblith, a law professor at DePaul University and president of the\nLawyers? Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation.\n\nAt the same time, she said, ?it helps to distance the museum from a\nquestionable piece.? There is less risk of public disapproval should a\nmuseum be forced to return a piece that arrived as a donation, she said.\n\nFor at least the past decade, though, Peter C. Marzio, director of the\nMuseum of Fine Arts in Houston and a past president of the Association of\nArt Museum Directors, said, both collectors and museums have been conducting\n?diligent provenance inquiries? on artifacts that change hands.\n\nHe cited an auction on Thursday at Sotheby?s in New York where a\n2,000-year-old bronze statue of Artemis sold for $28.6 million, a world\nrecord for sculpture and for an antiquity.\n\n?Provenance is what is driving prices up,? Mr. Marzio said. ?Provenance is\nhaving enormous value.? The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo acquired\nthe Artemis from a Manhattan dealer in 1953, well before the adoption of a\n1970 Unesco convention governing traffic in cultural property.\n\nDuring a courtroom break, Mr. Hecht, the dealer on trial here, scoffed at\nthe notion of a collector like Ms. White having an economic incentive for\ndonating to a museum. ?The last thing Shelby Levy White needs is a tax\ndeduction,? Mr. Hecht said. She ?really liked and learned about every piece\nshe bought.? \n\nRunning parallel to the trial is the Italian Culture Ministry?s dogged\neffort to lay claim to what it contends are looted objects in American\nmuseums. Last year it negotiated the return of 21 antiquities from the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art and 13 from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nTalks with the Getty have faltered. Italy is seeking the return of 52\nobjects over all from that museum, among them a dozen donated by Ms.\nFleischman. So far the Getty has agreed to return 26 artifacts to Italy,\nincluding 5 acquired from the Fleischmans and three pieces purchased from\nMr. Tempelsman.\n\nIn an interview Paolo Ferri, the trial prosecutor, asserted that American\ncollectors might one day find themselves at the defense table.\n\nOnce a verdict is delivered in the trial of Ms. True and Mr. Hecht, he said,\n?I?ll draw my conclusions.?\n\n\n\n  \nWinner of the 2004 Hugo Award - The Chesley Awards: A Retrospective, with\nJohn Grant and \nElizabeth Humphrey. http://www.aappl.us/\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Fri, 8 Jun 2007 16:52:06 +0100\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Stolen Vermeer/Art Hostage Blogs\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <6483987C0F684E7E868F5B10B8B3F1BE@ArtHostagePC>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nThese blogs,   http://stolenvermeer.blogspot.com/        http://arthostage.blogspot.com/\n\nalthough raw and full of unsubstantiated rumour provide a good read and reflect a Barometer of fellings within the art related crime world.\n\nNo elitist fluff, these blogs do exactly what they say on the tin, expose the shortcomings in art related crime investigation 2007.\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Sat, 9 Jun 2007 20:30:06 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Faking it. Tom Flynn investigates the world of dodgy\n\tdeals\tand counterfeit creations.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <09bc01c7aac4$343eeec0$9cbccc40$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\n>From 'Art Quarterly'\nThe magazine of The Art Fund, Summer 2007\n\nFaking it\n\nThe recent revelation that Bolton Museum's Amarna Princess statue is a fake\nmanufactured in 2003 rather than an ancient Egyptian piece has focused\nattention on the perennial problem of forgeries. Tom Flynn investigates the\nworld of dodgy deals and counterfeit creations.\n\nFakes have been described as \"the venereal disease of the illicit art\nmarket\" and it is an apt metaphor. As prices in the art market rise\nexponentially, so the risk of contamination by counterfeit objects increases\naccordingly. Reputations are at stake, but so are significant amounts of\nmoney as fakers and forgers become more sophisticated in their methods.?\n\nThe Amarna Princess, which was acquired with Art Fund help in 2003 as an\nancient Egyptian representation of a daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten (reigned\n1379-1362 BC) has left a trail of red faces from Bolton to Bloomsbury and so\nit is hardly surprising that on making a few gentle enquiries for this\narticle lips remained as tightly sealed as a pharaoh's tomb. Then, in late\nApril this year, 84-year-old George Greenhalgh of Bromley Cross, Bolton, and\nfour members of his family, were charged with conspiracy defraud in relation\nto the statue. They are due to appear in court on 24 July.\n\nSuspicions about the Amarna Princess first arose in early 2006 when a\nrelief, purporting to be Assyrian, was submitted to the British Museum for\nexpert opinion. When it emerged that the relief had come from the Greenhalgh\nfamily ? the same source as the Amarna Princess ? Scotland Yard was called\nin. Now it seems the alabaster torso could be one of any number of fake\nobjects allegedly produced by the same highly skilled team of fakers and\nforgers between 1989 and 2003.\n\nDick Ellis, director of the specialist art consultancy The Art Management\nGroup, is a former Head of Scotland Yard's Art & Antiques Unit and a\nworld-renowned expert on art crime, fakes and forgeries. In the early 1990s,\nEllis recalls that paintings purporting to be by the Scottish Colourist S.J.\nPeploe began circulating in the art trade. Alarm bells rang when the paint\nfell off.? The pictures were traced to a family in Bolton. According to\nEllis, Scotland Yard could have made an arrest at the time but failed to do\nso due to organisational constraints. The consequences of that inaction are\nnow becoming clear.?\n\nSome years after the Peploe incident, Ellis was invited to the office of Dr\nRobert Anderson, director of the British Museum. Dr Anderson and his\ncolleagues had begun nurturing some doubts about a large Romano-British\nsilver tray ? the so-called Risley Park Lanx ? which had appeared at\nSotheby's in 1991 and was acquired by the museum shortly after for around\n?100,000.?\n\nThe Risley Park Lanx was discovered at Risley Park, Derbyshire in 1729 and\npublished by William Stukeley in 1736, but subsequently vanished. When it\nreappeared in the 1990s it was supported by a provenance document purporting\nto be a will,? bequeathing the lanx to ? you guessed it ? a member of the\nsame Bolton-based family responsible for the peeling Peploes. What\ncomplicated matters, however, was the fact that the lanx had tested positive\nas Roman silver. Had the family recast the object from genuine Roman coins??\n\nThe Risley Park Lanx continues to be something of a mystery, not to say a\nsource of slight embarrassment to the British Museum, where it is no longer\non display. Deputy Director of The British Museum Andrew Burnett says the\nlanx remains problematic. \"There have been different views of it and it's\nsomething we're looking at again in the light of the Amarna Princess case.\nWe haven't formed a final view on it yet.\"\n\nThe Risley Lanx case illustrates that there are good fakes and bad fakes and\ngood fakes often turn out to be as interesting as genuine pieces. This was\nmade clear in a 1990 exhibition at the British Museum ? Fake? - The Art of\nDeception ? which featured objects from the entire museum spectrum. Andrew\nBurnett says, \"People tend to have a very polarised view of the world of\nfakes and the world of genuine things and see a sharp and easy distinction\nbetween the two. We need to get over to people that it is very difficult to\ntell in a very considerable number of cases and opinions do change.\"\n\nOne member of the London Egyptology trade told Art Quarterly that he had\nseen a number of pieces allegedly from the Lancashire source and that the\nAmarna Princess was better than most of the things they'd done. \"It was very\nconvincing, and not at all surprising that it fooled everyone.\"?\n\nClearly a combination of thorough research and genuine craftsmanship went\ninto the making of the Amarna Princess, suggesting that a network of\nknowledgeable individuals was responsible.?\n\nAnother expert familiar with the Amarna Princess affair, who asked to remain\nanonymous, says the alabaster carving is an example of \"a good fake\". \"We\nshouldn't be thinking of these people as Egyptological forgers, but as\npeople who make things,\" said the source. \"Every curator sees lots of fairly\npoor stuff every year and one can easily spot the workshops turning out fake\nterracotta lamps. But the Amarna Princess falls into an altogether different\ncategory and is a reminder that that the really good fakes in public and\nprivate collections haven't been spotted yet.\"\n\nAndrew Burnett concedes that, \"It may be the case that there are more things\naround,\" but adds, \"There is no need for panic to set in. Fakes have been\naround ever since people started collecting in the Renaissance and that will\nalways go on.\"?\n\nThe house raided by police in Bolton last year contained \"ancillary\nequipment\" for fabricating an eclectic range of objects, making the\ninvestigation all the more difficult. ?\n\nVersatility has been a mark of some of the most successful fakers and\nforgers. The notorious Italian sculptor Alceo Dossena (1878-1937) created\neverything from Greek marble Athenas to 'Simone Martini' Annunciations\nbefore he was discovered, while John Myatt, in league with his accomplice\nJohn Drewe, created works in the style of everyone from Chagall to\nGiacometti until arrested in 1995. ?\n\nLike the Drewe case, the Amarna Princess reveals how today's forgers are\nincreasingly aware that it is not enough to fake the object; supporting\ndocumentary provenance must also be fabricated. Nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century auction catalogues were not always illustrated and often\nrelied on scant descriptions alone, thus making it easier for fakers to\nascribe false histories to their counterfeit creations.\n\nJames Ede, director of leading London antiquities dealer Charles Ede Ltd.,\nsays the trend towards ever more convincing provenance-faking is the most\nirritating aspect of the Amarna Princess case and others like it. \"I hate\nfakers and forgers with a passion because they're trying to undermine one of\nthe most valuable tools of the honest trade ? our approach to authentication\nthrough diligent provenance research.\" Mr Ede believes, however, that the\nAmarna case will not have any negative impact on the legitimate trade, but\neveryone will learn from it. \"My 'Black Museum' is enormous,\" says Mr Ede.\n\"I always say that one's ignorance is encyclopedic and any dealer who\ndoesn't occasionally inadvertently buy fakes isn't trying hard enough. We're\nall human and we all make mistakes.\"\n\nThe main ammunition against fakes and forgeries is a combination of\nprovenance research, scientific analysis and old-fashioned connoisseurial\nexpertise, none of which is infallible. The Amarna Princess could not be\nscientifically authenticated as stone is not amenable to testing, while the\nprovenance connecting the object to a late 19th century auction at Silverton\nPark, Devon appeared to be convincing. As for connoisseurship, this too has\nits limits as the quality of workmanship can often be entirely convincing.?\n\nBut is connoisseurship a dying art? Andrew Burnett believes not. \"I think\nthere are fewer people around who know the material well personally, but\nit's not a dying art. Connoisseurship will always remain very important. My\nsense of scientific tests is that sometimes they can help you rule something\nout, but they can very rarely prove that something is genuine. Hence the\nconnoisseur's knowledge of the object, of the materials and of who produced\nit, will always remain very important.\"\n\nAs for the influence of the market, some commentators believe the\ncombination of rising prices and the easier routes to market via the\ninternet are encouraging illegal activity. In May 2000, Kenneth Walton, a\nformer lawyer, fabricated and sold a forged Richard Diebenkorn abstract oil\npainting for $135,858. He recently wrote a best-selling book about his\nexploits, perhaps proving that crime does pay.? Meanwhile, last year, a\nnumber of fake spot prints by Damien Hirst appeared on the open market in an\nattempt to cash in on the rapidly escalating prices for authentic examples.?\n\n\"This is one of the trends you can expect to see,\" says Dick Ellis. \"The\nlast boom in the art market in the late '80s and early '90s was followed by\na boom in fakes and forgeries. Now the market is booming again. Over the\nnext five years you'll see a commensurate growth in the incidence of art\ncrime.\"?\n? ?\nIn the event that the Greenhalghs are found guilty and their assets are\nhanded to Bolton Museum, The Art Fund will ask Bolton to repay a portion of\nits grant for the Amarna Princess.?\n\nwww.tomflynn.co.uk\nwww.artfund.org\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Sat, 9 Jun 2007 21:26:54 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Over 14,000 objects, artefacts and art works have been\n\tstolen from South Africa?s museums, galleries and heritage\n\tinstitutions in the last four years, the Democratic Alliance said on\n\tFriday.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <0a8801c7aacc$2308d460$691a7d20$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"windows-1257\"\n\n?Thousands of heritage objects stolen?\n\n\nPARLIAMENT ?

The\nWatch List includes sites in the Middle East, Afghanistan,\nBosnia/Herzegovina, Cyprus and Sierra Leone. All of Iraq, which was on the\n2006 list, appears on the new one. Fund grants are training Iraqi experts\nwho will return when conditions improve. \n\nBamiyan Buddhas \n\nThe destruction of great works of art can stoke long-held grievances,\nexplained Marilyn Perry, the WMF's chairman, or motivate aid. When Taliban\nwarriors blew up the monumental 7th- century Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan,\n``the world wept for these great artifacts it had never known about,'' Perry\nsaid. By listing it, the fund hopes to spur additional international efforts\nto stabilize the site, which still possesses important wall paintings, and\nassist in conservation of statue fragments. \n\nThe WMF also has come to recognize the danger posed by global climate\nchange. Melting permafrost and rising seas threaten to swamp Herschel\nIsland, a historic Inuit whaling town in Canada. ``It may not be\nsalvageable,'' Burnham said. \n\nFrequent floods also afflict Sonargaon-Panam City, a medieval trading hub in\nlow-lying Bangladesh, while encroaching desert may destroy the Chinguetti\nMosque in Mauritania. In listing New Orleans, the fund worries that the\nbillions spent to date have yet to assure the future of its extraordinary\npast. \n\nLoved to Death \n\nSome critically important places are being loved to death by insensitive\ndevelopment. Poorly managed tourism threatens once-remote Machu Picchu, the\nancient Incan city in Peru. A tower for Gazprom, Russia's powerful oil\ncompany, will deface the onion-domed low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg. \n\nThe Watch List includes examples of important modern architecture, because\nits significance often goes unrecognized until it's too late. The 2008 list\nincludes Florida Southern College, in Lakeland, Florida, an elegantly domed\nand arcaded campus complex designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. \n\nThe project was underfunded when it was built starting in the late 1930s,\nand substandard materials were used. The maintenance and appropriate\nadaptation of the structures for current needs has long vexed the college. \n\nInsensitive new buildings threaten the sublime vista to the ocean from the\nSalk Center in La Jolla, California, a masterpiece by Louis I. Kahn. \n\nSometimes listing can have immediate impact. Squabbling government agencies\nhave united behind a plan to conserve the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain.\nNew funders have also stepped in to augment a $125,000 grant by American\nExpress. \n\n``Sometimes it's simply a matter of drawing attention,'' said John Stubbs,\nthe fund's vice president of field projects. \n\n(James S.

Nichols\nwitnessed a scene aboard the steamship Republic more terrifying than many of\nthe horrors he had recently witnessed in battle. While en route from New\nYork to New Orleans, the ship, which was carrying 80 passengers and coins\nthen worth a reported $400,000, sailed through a fierce hurricane,\nsustaining grave damage. As the wind howled, the vessel lurched sickeningly\nfrom side to side, rapidly taking on water. The crew struggled heroically to\nsave it. \"I cannot describe in words the impression which [the event] made\nupon my mind,\" wrote Nichols, a former army colonel, to his wife. \"It was\ndesperation intensified.\" A day later, Republic sank off the coast of\nGeorgia. At least 14 passengers perished. \n\n\n(Ken Feisel)\nSettling on the ocean floor, the wreck rested undisturbed for nearly 140\nyears, preserving rare details of the Reconstruction era, \"a brief period of\nAmerican history for which there are few known shipwrecks,\" says Robert\nNeyland, an underwater archaeologist at the Naval Historical Center in\nWashington, D.C. In the 1990s, however, an American shipwreck-recovery firm,\nOdyssey Marine Exploration, Inc., began methodically searching for Republic.\nIt sent out a research vessel loaded with remote-sensing gear, and in the\nsummer of 2003, the company finally located wreckage from the ship in\ninternational waters at a depth of some 1,700 feet. Under maritime law,\nsalvage companies are permitted to keep the ships they find in international\nwaters, provided no one else claims jurisdiction over the vessels. So\nOdyssey staked a claim to Republic in a U.S. federal court, obtaining legal\nownership. Then, with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the firm raised\nmore than 51,000 gold and silver coins from the site, as well as thousands\nof other artifacts, including hair-remedy bottles, mustard jars, children's\nslates, and ink wells. To help finance its operations, Odyssey began selling\nmany of these finds to eager collectors, earning millions in revenues.\nImpressed, Fortune Small Business magazine put the firm on its cover with\nthe headline: \"Treasure Inc.: How an Entrepreneur Went Hunting for Sunken\nGold-and Found a $20 Million-a-Year Business.\" \n\nIf a private corporation had targeted such an important site on land in the\nUnited States and hawked many of its artifacts, heritage activists would\nhave been up in arms, asking hard questions about the commercial\nexploitation of the country's cultural history. But there was no public\nprotest over the fate of Republic, and very little criticism in the press.\nMoreover, this was not an unusual state of affairs-treasure hunters often\nsell off shipwreck artifacts with scarcely a whisper of opposition. As a\njournalist who has been writing about archaeology for 25 years, I find this\ndisturbing. Why isn't there more of a hue and cry against nautical treasure\nhunting? Why does this industry seem to operate so freely? In search of\nanswers, I began closely examining the problem a year ago. I found, to my\ndismay, that we have created a bizarre double standard for terrestrial and\nmarine sites, turning a blind eye to the fate of the world's shipwrecks. In\nmuch of the world's oceans, treasure hunting is a perfectly legal\nenterprise. \n\nNautical archaeologists have long raised the alarm about this worrying state\nof affairs, but their warnings have gone largely unheeded. The discipline of\nmaritime archaeology developed after World War II. With the field being so\nnew, many legislators and members of the public still do not realize how\nmuch knowledge can be gleaned from the scientific investigation of a wreck,\nincluding the conservation and careful analysis of artifacts. The problem is\nfurther compounded by public perception: A certain swashbuckling, pirate\nglamour cloaks the operations of many treasure hunters. \n\nTo better understand treasure hunters and their operations, I paid a visit\nto Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the National Museum of\nAmerican History in Washington, D.C. Since the early 1990s, Johnston, a\nnautical archaeologist, has tracked the activities of treasure hunters\naround the world, amassing an impressive archive of business prospectuses,\ninvestor contracts, auction catalogues, reports, articles, correspondence,\nand other documents. Johnston offered to share this information with me, and\nI gladly took him up on it. Each morning of my visit, Johnston, a burly man\nwith alert, dark eyes and thinning, gray hair, greeted me at the museum's\nsecurity checkpoint and led me up to his office. Decorated with prints of\nsailing ships and a map from his recent excavation of the sunken yacht of\nKing Kamehameha II in Hawaii, it was kind of a shrine to the nautical world.\n\n\nJohnston's files revealed the broad spectrum of treasure hunting-from small\nfly-by-night operations to large sophisticated corporations whose directors\ninclude wealthy European nobles. And as we discussed the main players,\nJohnston mentioned two major trends in the industry he had noticed. \"I\ndefinitely see a major movement toward deeper-water search and recovery,\" he\nsaid, leaning back in his chair. For many years, treasure hunters stuck\nmainly to the shallows, where divers equipped with scuba gear could work\neasily. But increasingly, firms are shifting their focus to wrecks thousands\nof feet below the surface. There they retrieve gold coins or antique\nporcelain dishes by using ROVs equipped with video cameras and manipulator\narms, all under the watchful eyes of highly trained technicians. And the\nsteep cost of deepwater operations has led directly to the second trend that\nJohnston observed. \"I see a more businesslike approach to treasure hunting,\"\nhe told me, \"where charismatic individuals are being replaced by\ncorporations who have great funding and great technical ability.\" \n\nJohnston could not say with certainty how many of these firms are currently\ncombing the sea floor in search of wreck sites. Some companies operate in\nsecrecy, only publicizing their activities when their finds go to auction.\nHe estimated, however, that \"there are probably somewhere under a dozen\nserious treasure hunters worldwide.\" While some employ archaeologists to\nassist in their operations, these researchers contribute relatively little\nto scientific knowledge of ancient seafaring and ship design, as compared to\npublicly funded archaeologists. \n\nLet me give an example. In the late 1990s, Texas A&M archaeologist Filipe\nCastro and his colleagues excavated the wreck of a seventeenth-century\nmerchant ship off the coast of Portugal. Since then, Castro has diligently\nattempted to reconstruct the vessel from hull to rigging, and test its\nseaworthiness-something no treasure hunter has done, due to the grinding,\ntime-consuming analysis required. In pursuit of this goal, Castro has\npublished two scientific books and 26 articles on the wreck, and has\ncompleted six archaeological reports. His students have written a master's\nthesis and a doctoral dissertation on related topics, and Castro continues\nto study the wreck, presenting his findings in scientific journals. By\ncontrast, Odyssey Marine's work on Republic is little known to the\narchaeological community-even though, as the company cofounder, Greg Stemm,\npointed out to me, \"Our budget on a monthly basis is more than the Institute\nof Nautical Archaeology's annual budget [at Texas A&M University].\" To date,\nOdyssey's scientific staff has published just one book-on bottles recovered\nfrom the ship. Of the five reports they have written on Republic, none\nappears to have been published, although the company says it plans to post\nthem online. Moreover, Odyssey has now moved on to other shipwreck projects,\nthe most notable being the search for a treasure-laden seventeenth-century\nBritish warship, HMS Sussex, off the coast of Spain. \n\nAt heart, says Larry Murphy, chief of the Submerged Resources Center in the\nNational Parks Service, Odyssey and other such firms are about turning a\nprofit. \"What's going on is that you are excavating sites under a commercial\ntimeframe, making commercial decisions about profit and loss, and you are\ncollecting artifacts for sale.\" \n\nJust how much of an impact has the treasure-hunting industry had on the\nworld's underwater sites? It's a difficult question to answer because no one\nhas ever compiled statistics on the total number of sites worldwide and the\nnumber that have been damaged or disturbed by treasure hunters. But\narchaeologist Don Keith, president of the Ships of Discovery research\ninstitute at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History, thinks that\nthe movement of treasure hunters into deeper waters is a very worrying sign.\nIndeed, one study that he and colleague Toni Carrell completed suggests that\ntreasure seekers have so depleted shallow-water wrecks that they are now\nincreasingly forced to target ships lying far below the surface. It's a\nsituation, explains Keith, that parallels the excesses of the oil industry.\nJust as in oil prospecting, once you have found all the easy-to-reach\nfields, you have to spend a lot more money to find the difficult,\nhard-to-work ones. \n\nKeith is known among his colleagues as a thoughtful and deliberate man, with\na wry sense of humor. Like many in his profession, Keith has long worried\nabout the toll that treasure hunters are taking on the world's historic\nshipwrecks. In 1998, he read a Scientific American magazine article\nexplaining how petroleum geologists estimate the amount of oil left in the\nground, and it dawned on him that he could apply the same technique to gauge\nthe number of shipwrecks left in the seas. \n\n Is the world running out of shipwrecks? One recent study shows that in\nthree parts of the world-coastal Florida, Sussex County in England, and\nalong the various trade routes of the East Indiamen ships-half of all known\nshipwreck sites were discovered before the mid-1970s. Borrowing a\nmathematical model developed for the oil industry, the study suggests that\nshipwrecks are a rapidly declining resource. [LARGER IMAGE] \n\nDuring the 1950s, American geophysicist Marion King Hubbert set out to learn\nhow much petroleum remained in the lower 48 states. In 1956, he observed\nthat the volume of oil that a particular oilfield produced tended to form a\npredictable bell curve over time. Peak production occurred once about half\nthe crude in a given field was exhausted; after that, the rate of oil\nextraction started tapering off. So Hubbert developed a mathematical model\nto forecast when this halfway point would be reached. Today, geologists can\ngauge the decline of oilfields in a region by using the Hubbert Model. \n\nTo examine the situation with shipwrecks, Keith and Carrell began searching\nfor regional statistics on the numbers of discovered wrecks and the dates on\nwhich they were found. They came up with detailed figures for two\ngeographical regions-the coasts of Florida in the United States and the\nwaters off Sussex County in England-as well as the famous trade routes that\nEast Indiamen ships once plied between Europe and Southeast Asia. The pair\nthen applied the Hubbert Model to all three statistical sets, which covered\nthe period from 1960 to 1998. \"In each case,\" says Keith, \"the curve for\nshipwreck discoveries came out showing that the time between 1974 and 1976\nwas the peak.\" Such findings, he suggests, point to the immediate need for\nstrong conservation measures. \"We concluded that more than half of the\nshipwreck sites that will ever be found have already been found. So the\nresource is being depleted very quickly, and when it's gone, it's gone.\"\nIndeed, Keith and Carrell's data suggest that at the current rate, all wreck\nsites off the coasts of Australia, Europe, Great Britain, Canada, the United\nStates, and in the Caribbean islands will have been found and exploited in\njust another 30 years. \n\nI think Keith and Carrell's study shows clearly why treasure hunters are\nspending so much money to recover artifacts from deepwater sites. Just as\noil companies now invest heavily in wresting crude from costly sources such\nas the Canadian tar sands, commercial salvors are now increasingly forced to\nlook for historic shipwrecks in some of the most inaccessible parts of the\nocean. During the 1960s, treasure hunters spent just a few dollars a day\nhunting for gold coins on a fleet of Spanish galleons that sank in shallow\nwaters of the Florida coast. Working Republic-with ROVs, a crew of 40, and\nall the other technology-cost tens of thousands of dollars a day. \n\nSo how do treasure hunters raise enough money to chase after the world's\never-diminishing number of shipwrecks? As we sat over lunch in the museum's\nstaff cafeteria one day, Paul Johnston offered a colorful primer. Generally,\nhe explained, small private corporations target affluent investors. As the\nprospectuses in Johnston's files disclose, they focus on individuals who\nearn more than $200,000 annually and who possess a net worth exceeding $1\nmillion-people who can readily afford to lose their investment. Often, says\nJohnston, the owners of these companies call on affluent friends to help\nround up prospects. In one case, Johnston wangled an invitation to a private\nevent held for Robert Marx, a legendary treasure hunter who claims to have\nfound a Roman ship off the coast of Brazil. The hostess, says Johnston, \"was\na wealthy Philadelphia woman with strong social connections. As I remember,\nshe was some kind of princess, from a deposed Eastern European monarchy.\" At\nthe gathering, Marx \"showed a movie of his work, told some stories, then\nsaid he was looking for another ship and that it would be a good investment\nopportunity, although you could lose every penny. Then he told the story of\nthe ship, with some embellishments.\" \n\nBlessed with charm and the gift of gab, successful treasure hunters often\npossess an uncanny ability to latch onto investors. For more than 20 years,\nlegendary shipwreck-seeker Mel Fisher searched for Spanish galleons off the\ncoast of Florida, before finding the gold-laden Nuestra Senora de Atocha in\n1985. But Fisher, who died in 1998, was almost equally renowned for his\nprowess in attracting investors. He'd hunt for them as they bent their\nelbows in the bars of Key West, and as they languished in senior-citizen\nhomes. As Cheryl Ward, an underwater archaeologist at Florida State\nUniversity told me, Fisher made a point of carrying a gold doubloon in his\npocket. When he'd meet someone for the first time, he'd drop it and let his\nacquaintance pick it up. \"He said when people touched it, they got gold\nfever,\" recalled Ward. \n\nFor these investors, Fisher often brandished a contract lasting just one\nyear. In it, he agreed to pay .01 percent of the treasure he raised in one\nfield season in exchange for an investment of $1,000. All payouts were to be\nmade in treasure, as opposed to cash, and Fisher was under no obligation to\nraise all the gold he found in one year. Shortly after he found Atocha,\nMoney magazine investigated the soundness of such investments. While Fisher\nclaimed, for example, that the Atocha treasure was worth $400 million, Money\nconcluded that this figure was \"almost surely wrong.\" All estimates of the\ntreasure's worth were supplied by Fisher or an associate, and were based on\nthe prices that starstruck tourists paid on impulse for coins in Fisher's\nsmall museum gift shop in Key West, a place Money called, \"the retail\nbull's-eye.\" But the Atocha treasure commanded considerably lower prices in\nindependent coin shops, perhaps as little as 6 to 25 percent of the gift\nshop prices. This was particularly bad news for Fisher's investors who had\nto sell their payout-items of treasure-on the open market. \n\nBy contrast, the large treasure-seeking corporations conduct their financial\naffairs in a more conventional manner. Odyssey Marine Exploration, for\nexample, is publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange, and files\nregular reports on its activities to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese documents brim with details of complex financial maneuvers and a\nnetwork of subsidiary companies. And as befits a large private corporation,\nOdyssey is hungry for profit and open to partnerships. In 2002, the firm\nsigned a highly controversial deal with the British government to find and\nrecover artifacts from HMS Sussex, a British naval vessel that is reputed to\nhave carried more than $1 billion (in today's dollars) worth of gold and\nsilver when it sank in 1694. If Odyssey is successful, it will split part of\nthe proceeds with the British government-a troubling precedent, I believe,\nfor a country that once prided itself on its naval and maritime heritage. \n\nAlmost six years ago, the general conference of the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized that\nshipwrecks lying in international waters were in grave peril. It voted in\nfavor of adopting a new international treaty to safeguard them, the\nConvention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. Among its\nmany provisions, the convention states that \"Underwater cultural heritage\nshall not be commercially exploited,\" and it directs signatories to impose\nsanctions on those who violate its measures. To date, 14 countries, from\nSpain and Portugal to Panama and Mexico, have ratified the\nconvention-another six must do so before this treaty can take effect. \n\nThe convention is not an ideal solution, but it is certainly a major step\nforward for those intent on protecting the nautical past. Even so, many of\nthe world's leading maritime nations-including the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom-have yet to ratify it. And as these governments drag their\nheels, the clock continues to tick on the world's sunken ships. It's time to\nput science ahead of the Almighty Dollar, and cultural heritage ahead of the\nbottom line of private corporations. If we don't, we will truly be missing\nthe boat.\n\nHeather Pringle is a freelance science journalist and author of Master Plan:\nHimmler's Scholars and the Holocaust.\n\n\nC 2007 by the Archaeological Institute of America\nwww.archaeology.org/0707/etc/insider.html\nhttp://www.archaeologyorg/0707/etc/insider.html\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 9\nDate: Sun, 10 Jun 2007 10:31:24 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Eugene Delacroix drawing of one of his paintings in the\n\tLouvre Museum has been returned to a Milwaukee gallery after\tbeing\n\tstolen nearly two years ago.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <048201c7ab39$bb6cbe20$32463a60$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nDrawing Returned After Theft 2 Years Before\nLast Update: Jun 9, 2007 12:48 PM\n    \nMILWAUKEE (AP) - A Eugene Delacroix drawing of one of his paintings in the\nLouvre Museum has been returned to a Milwaukee gallery after being stolen\nnearly two years ago. \n\nThe sepia drawing is called \"Entry of the Crusaders Into Constantinople.\" \n\nThe French romantic artist drew it around 1840 as a study for a larger\npainting that now hangs in Paris.
