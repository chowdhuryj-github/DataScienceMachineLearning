Still, it's extremely annoying how\nthe mainstream media are getting away with all this talk of \"breaking\"\npatents to describe what the governments of Brazil and Thailand have\nrecently done through compulsory licensing. I'm not a lawyer but I don't\nunderstand how they can use this kind of terminology since the\npossibility of such licensing is written into patent law not to mention\nthe TRIPS Agreement. It's part of the deal when you get a patent. So\nwhat is being broken?\n\nIt reminds me of the campaign to instill the word \"piracy\" in our minds,\nto demonise people who copy (regardless of how people understand fair\nuse under copyright law or what they think is legitimate).\n\nUnless this term \"breaking\" patents is really correct, the media should\nbe challenged and stopped from using it any further. No?\n\nthanks & kind regards\nRenee Vellve\nGRAIN\n\n--\n\n________________________________________\nGRAIN\nAurora Apts, Unit 1, Pearl St, Umali Sbd\nCollege, Laguna 4031 | Philippines\nTel: +63 49 536.39.79 | Fax: +63 49 536.55.26\nWeb: http://www.grain.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
