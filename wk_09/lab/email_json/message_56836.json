Someone spoke of beeing able to do a FreeBsd install \nthrough a serial console but I have not been able to get it working \ndo to it hanging at trying to mount root from ufs:/dev/md0. I was \nwondering if I could instead edit a configuration file on the ISO \nusing an iso editor to manualy turn on ssh and configure the IP \nAddress? I have found a few things talking about placeing a config \nfile on a floppy but couldn't find that much about it. I want to run \na freebsd install from vmware and ssh into it with securecrt and was \nwondering what the best way to go about it was. I have tried the \nserial console from a vm and a real box I have here and got it \nhanging at the same point on each one. Odd thing is, when I hooked a \ncrt up to the real box, and, on the display of the vm, if I just let \nit go to it's normal install, it works fine.\nSorry if I am so new to this.\nThanks for any help I may can get.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
