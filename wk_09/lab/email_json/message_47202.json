For instance,\n> this can happen if you mistakenly type something into a cell; \n> it can also\n> change your column classes when you don't - for example:\n> \n> > options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE)\n> > x <- data.frame(letters[1:5],1:5)\n> > sapply(x,class)\n> letters.1.5.         X1.5 \n>     \"factor\"    \"integer\" \n> > fix(x) # no user-changes made\n> > sapply(x,class)\n> letters.1.5.         X1.5 \n>     \"factor\"    \"numeric\" \n> \n> (3) I believe Deepayan Sarkar contributed the tab-completion \n> capability at\n> the command line. So unless you have a lot of objects beginning with\n> 'AuroraStoch...' you should be able to type a few letters and let the\n> auto-completion handle the rest.\n> \n> Best regards,\n> \n> ST\n> \n> \n> --- Horace Tso  wrote:\n> \n> > Dear list,\n> > \n> > First apologize that this is trivial and just betrays my \n> slothfulness at\n> > the keyboard.
