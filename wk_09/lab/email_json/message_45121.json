If it is, please\nignore it and I apologize for taking up your time.\n\nI'm currently looking to implement a web function and an OS/X widget\nutilizing JavaScript's XmlHttpRequest (aka asynchronous javascript, aka\nAJAX). I thought at first it might make more sense to write the backend\npart of my script in PHP, but PHP lacks\nhttp://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Tail/Tail.pm which I'd like to use for\ncontinuous screening of a spool file.\n\nI was hoping someone could point me in the correct direction to have\nPerl properly speak with XmlHttpRequest. My main objective is to use\nAJAX functionality to speak to Perl on the backend, find me updates to\nthe spool/log file, and push that information back to the JavaScript\nobject which processes it and puts it into the browser.\n\nIs what I'm looking for feasible? Make sense?\n\nThank you all, and enjoy your weekend!\n\n- sf\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
