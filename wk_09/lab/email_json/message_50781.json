(see the bty parameter in ?par for details)\n\nIf you don't want the lines extending beyond the axes on the right and\ntop then you could do something more like:\n\n> plot(5:10, 5:10, bty='n')\n> library(TeachingDemos)\n> lines(cnvrt.coords( c(0,0,.5), c(.5,0,0), input='plt')$usr)\n\nYou may also get what you want by playing with the xaxp and yaxp\nparameters to par, but the bty='l' seems the easiest way to go. \n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
