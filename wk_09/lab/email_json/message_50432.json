For one reason or another the\ncomputers were never used and no one now seems to be able to locate\neither the paperwork or the hardware. The school district experienced\nhard financial times and ultimately never paid Big Blue for the\ncomputers. In 1993 the district and IBM negotiated a long-term settlement\nthat said the school district would pay the first of four $1.25 million\ninstallments beginning in 2008. Payments were deferred until then because\n2008 was the year the district was scheduled to finish making state loan\nrepayments under its previous loan plan, according to the Contra Costa\nstory.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/18/206258\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://networkworld.com/\n    1. http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/16331\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| AT&T Quietly Introduces $10/Month DSL                          |\n|   from the not-what-i-call-broadband dept.                         |\n|   posted by kdawson on Monday June 18, @19:17 (Communications)     |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/18/220240               |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]prostoalex writes \"As part of the deal with the FCC to approve the\nAT&T/BellSouth merger, AT&T [1]started selling, but not advertising, a\n$10-per-month DSL service in 22 states, AP has learned.
