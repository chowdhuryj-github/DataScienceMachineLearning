I found similar symptoms in that there was no speech during boot \neven though the apposite modules are in the initrd.  After the system \nstarted I did a rmmod amd modprobe of the speakup_dectlk module and 2nd \ntime around it found the Dec Express and all was happy.\nSo I'd say slightly quirky as opposed to being fu-bared.\n\nCheers,\nGarry\n\n-- \nGarry Turkington\ngarry.turkington@gmail.com\n\nOn Sun, 17 Jun 2007, Igor Gueths wrote:\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA512\n>\n> Hi.
