I have a network whose my output has, says K node. I would like to put a set of constraints on this layer. Indeed, I have two type of constraints. The first type is that their outputs should sum up to one. The second type is monotonic increasing from the first output node to the K-th node. How can I achieve this? Thank you so much in advance.\n\n- adschai\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
