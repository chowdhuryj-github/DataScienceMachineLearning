E.g.,\n\nmtcars$HP <- equal.count(mtcars$hp)\n\nxyplot(mpg ~ disp | HP + factor(cyl), mtcars,\n       par.strip.text = list(lines = 0.5),\n       strip = function(which.given, which.panel, ...) {\n           if (which.given == 2)\n               strip.default(which.given = 1,\n                             which.panel = which.panel[which.given],\n                             ...)\n       })\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
