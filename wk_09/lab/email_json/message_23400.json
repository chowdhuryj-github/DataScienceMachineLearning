I was wondering is the density function like? What sort of partitions are you looking for?\n\nSorry I am not of much help, but this question perhaps better-defined?\n\nBest,\nRanjan\n\n\n\nOn Fri, 4 May 2007 14:48:36 -0500 (CDT) David Forrest  wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> \n> I'd like to partition a 2d probability density function into regions of \n> equal probability.
