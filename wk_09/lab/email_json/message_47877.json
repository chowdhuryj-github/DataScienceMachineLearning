The string\nData::Dumper produced has the NUL character in it, put the display\ncannot show it.  To force Data::Dumper to do the right thing for the\ndisplay you must set $Data::Dumper::Useqq to 1.  It will then use\ndoublequoted strings and escape characters (like \\t, \\n, \\0 etc).\n\nperl -MData::Dumper -e '$Data::Dumper::Useqq = 1;%h = (\"\\0\", 3);print\nDumper(\\%h);'\n$VAR1 = {\n          \"\\0\" => 3\n        };\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
