Something of \nsignificance with respect to Google Groups and beginners[at]perl.org \nhappened on May 25th.\n\nBefore May 25, no messages with an \"NNTP-Posting-Host\" header appeared \non this list. After May 24, such messages started to appear, and *all* \nof them have a User-Agent of \"G2/1.0\" (Google Groups).\n\nI've placed a CSV file and an Excel worksheet on my website; they \ndemonstrate the timing of the change:\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~mumia.w.18.spam/msgs3.csv\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~mumia.w.18.spam/msgs3.xls\n\nI hope that the list managers can stop Google's messages from making it \nto the mailing list.\n\n* I was looking at my archive of debian-user when I concluded that there \nwas no problem (Doh!)\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
