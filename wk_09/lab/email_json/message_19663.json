We create a test network rather than a test server. \n\nThe disadvantage is that the network will tend to grow a lot. To test\nclustering we will need at least 4 smbd daemons running, as otherwise\nall the different inter-node patterns aren't tested. That could lead\nto quite a large list of processes running :)\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
