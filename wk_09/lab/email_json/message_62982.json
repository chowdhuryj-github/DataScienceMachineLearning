But why does the loop count through the last\nelement of the @data array, when you're processing the @sta array? And\ndid you ever initialize $kml?\n\nMost uses of the computed for loop, like that one, are simpler as a\nforeach loop in Perl:\n\n  foreach my $i (0..$#data) { ... }\n\nOr even this:\n\n  foreach my $element (@data) { ... }\n\n> At this point, if I use following script, I can work as I wish:\n> print \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\";\n> print $kml;\n>\n> if I use \"print FID $kml;\", the trouble is coming...\n\nWhat trouble? Are you saying that $kml printed to a file is different\nthan $kml rendered in a web browser, or what?\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
