Hamas forces then surrounded the vehicle and riddled it with gunfire, said one witness, who works in a nearby factory. \"It was unbelievable. May God help us,\" said the man, who gave only his first name, Jamil, out of fear for his safety.\n\nHospital and security officials said eight men were killed in the ambush. After the incident, several bodies were seen strewn in the grass near the overturned jeep, as gunmen in pickup trucks nearby held machine guns in the air.\n\nAs the fighting raged, Israeli troops opened fire at two gunmen who approached the border, the army said. Palestinian officials said one man was killed. He was identified as a member of the Presidential Guard, who apparently was trying to help his comrades against Hamas.\n\nWitnesses also said three Israeli tanks approached Karni, and the Hamas force quickly withdrew. Israel also closed the crossing, known as Gaza's lifeline because it is the passage for cargo going in and out of the area.\n\n--!>   \u00a0 Suite 302 - 1111 Lonsdale North Vancouver, BC Canada, V7M 2H4  Follow this link for removal:remove me \n\n\n \n"}
