Check latest reports of Parrot\nconfiguration tools testing coverage to see where your time is best\ndevoted.  You will have to determine a way to test a user response to\na prompt. In the course of writing tests, you should try to resolve\nRT 43171.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
