Tyurin and outgoing space station commander Mike Lopez-Alegria are wrapping up a 215-day mission, a single-flight record for a U.S. astronaut. Joining them for the ride home is U.S. businessman Charles Simonyi, who paid the Russians some $20 million to become the fifth tourist to visit the station. He blasted off with two new station crew members April 7 and is wrapping up a two-week voyage. This status report will be updated after landing or as conditions warrant.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nNASA ISS-15 Crew Page:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition15/index.html\n\nNASA ISS-14 Crew Page:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/index.html\n\nCharles Simonyi:\nhttp://www.charlesinspace.com\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
