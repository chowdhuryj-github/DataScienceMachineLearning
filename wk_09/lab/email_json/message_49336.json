There is a way to do this on most distros these days.\nI have done it on debian, redhat, and slackware for sure. Get \nthe network install boot image and let it go, it will take a long\ntime though.\n\n Tyler said.\nIs there any way I can just install like debian with a really old kernel,\n like off flyppy, then use apt to upgrade?\n\nIt's not that you'd need an old kernel, just a generic one, \nbasically the same bare ones that are used when doing the\ninitial install. But as I said in other message, if you are \ngetting disk boot failure, then something else is wrong. \nA different kernel will not fix that. Check the connections\nand if you can, check the BIOS drive settings. If there is\nanother drive in there, take it out for now and boot with \njust the new drive.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
