Oh well.  \n\nWell, synths seem to be a love-hate thing, some people like a\nparticular synth, and others can't stand the same synth. I personally\nhave had my doubletalk pc for 9 years now, and am happy with\nit. Hopefully, you'll consider your doubletalk lt to have been a\nworth-while investment once you get it. As for a usb synth, you should\nbe able to use your lt under windblows at least via a usb to serial\nconverter, and they'll hopefully become useable under speakup one day\nalso, I mean serial synths via a usb to rs232 converter of course.\n\n> Heard there was a\n> screen reader for DOS, and was considering even that.

You can find it at:\n\nhttp://www.mhcable.com/~chuckh/provox7.zip\n\nand yes, it will work with your doubletalk lt as far as I can recall.\n\nAs for using it in dosemu, you most certainly can, provided you've\nconfigured the serial port correctly in dosemu, but you won't need to\ndo that when using speakup, since speakup actually speaks in your\ndosemu sessions as well. In fact, if you tried to use both speakup and\nprovox in a dosemu session with the same synth, I wouldn't be\nsurprised if you ran into problems.\n\nGreg\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGchvU7s9z/XlyUyARApAyAJ0Q2NHxNMTFaba1XyyIlGswI+3SEwCfTyCx\nA3Yn8u0b13qPhpdoucrXVyE=\n=atHQ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
