I believe I'd \nneed kernel-package to make that a bit easier.  Also, I'm a bit unsure about \nthings like initial ram disks--I never needed an initrd with Gentoo.  Might \nyou be able to provide some instructions on what exactly I'd need to do to \nget a kernel that will boot?  I've never had to deal with the vagueries of \nkernel-package and all that before.\nThanks much,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Gregory Nowak\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Wednesday, June 06, 2007 11:47 AM\nSubject: Re: Upgrading Debian to Testing with speakup\n\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> To upgrade to testing, all you really need to do is to replace the\n> stable word on every line of your /etc/apt/sources.list with the word\n> testing.
