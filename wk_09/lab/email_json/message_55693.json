You can also get the overlay effect using\npar(new=TRUE), but then you need to be careful with axis labels and\nscales and the plot may end up being more confusing then helpful.\n\nFor b), if you are just doing a quick exploration of the plot, there is\nthe zoomplot function in the TeachingDemos package that may work for\nyou.  If you want a plot to print/save, it is best to specify xlim and\nylim in the initial plotting function to create it at the correct\nsize/zoom from the beginning.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
