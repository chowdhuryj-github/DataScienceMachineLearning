It would have been \nmuch better to ask the license questions in the preinst script using \ndebconf. As an Ubuntu packager, I do not endorce the packaging quality \nof the deb.\n\nI would also think that offering a tarball download would make sense, as \nthere are users of other distros here, such as Slackware. At this point, \nsuch users have to jump through hoops just to get the package \ninstalled.\n- -- \nLuke Yelavich\nGPG key: 0xD06320CE \n\t (http://www.themuso.com/themuso-gpg-key.txt)\nEmail & MSN: themuso@themuso.com\nJabber: themuso@jabber.org.au\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGaKCYjVefwtBjIM4RAhsEAKCf8suPqNLlJQx6xwGI/JU3gyQg8wCcCNJl\nQ91sFp13HlogSHsWRY4CFxg=\n=UKuV\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
