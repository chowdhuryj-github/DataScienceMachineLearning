Here is the skeleton of \nwhat my code would be:\n\nfor (i in 1:zillion)\n   {\n    results[[i]]<-do.something.function()\n    if (logical.test(i)) {save(results, \"results.tmp\")}\n   }\n\nlogical.test would test to see if i/1000 has no remainder. What R \nfunction would test that?\n\nIs there an even better way to address my need?\n\nThanks,\nMark\n-- \n\n---\n\nMark W.
