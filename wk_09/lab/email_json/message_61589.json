I can't remember, but \nit was discussed on Groklaw, and v3 *is* retroactive to the extent that \na lot of stuff is licenced \"or later\".\n\nCertainly the feeling is that MS will get caught by this date thingy as \na result of their deal with Novell.\n>\n>If a company entered prior to 1989 into a weird agreement forbidding the\n>distribution of source code, would we say that GPL sections that mandate\n>availability of source are retroactive?\n\nIn that case, they simply wouldn't be able to distribute GPL software, \nbecause they wouldn't be able to comply with the licence.\n\nCheers,\nWol\n-- \nAnthony W.
