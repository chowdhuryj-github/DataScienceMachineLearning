Hence:\n\n> colr[0]\ncharacter(0)\n\n> colr[1]\n[1] \"gray\"\n\n> colr[2]\n[1] \"pink\"\n\n\nAll you really need is:\n\n  barplot(test$score, beside = TRUE, space = .4, col = colr)\n\nas 'colr' will be recycled as required here.\n\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
