I've been planning from long ago on\nporting over from Debian to Slackware.  Makes it kind of convenient that\nthey now support the SpeakUp kernal.  I have a fresh copy of Debian\ninstalled, courtesy of a friend's help, and I've poking around in it\nusing Oralux.  I think I have almost everything but Festival installed.\n  I managed to get emacspeak to say \"ls\" once, so I know there's\nsomething working, sans a hardware speech synth.  I'd rather just get a\nsupported hardware synth and insall Slackware.  I'm not too sure about\nusing a GUI anymore.  I like Midnight Commander, tin, and lynx for\npretty much everything.  bitchx, too.  Never got to use pine.  (All\nthat's from reading the SpeakUp docs on working with SpeakUp and\nemacspeak to use Midnight Commander and pine...whatever pine\nis...probably an email client.(  For email, I'd probably just make due\nwith the Linux mail commend.  I have a passion for scripting and\naliases, as I can get things done a whole lot faster just typing \"ggl\"\nthan booting up mozilla and navagating all the menus to reach\nGoogle...that and I can script the output to filter out all the links I\ndon't need to \"see.\"  Back in '02, all I used X for was X-Chat andForte\nAgent under Wine.\nAnyway, the command line interface is fine for me, as long as there a\ncouple full-screen utilities and clients to possibly make things easier.\n  SpeakUp seems to fit the bill perfectly.  Trying to get Debian running\nagain from Oralux and Windows has been a real education, to say the\nleast. \n     I'll certainly get around to the X environment, once I can get a\nusable command line.  I'm planning on having as many fall-back positions\nas is possible, as I'm stuck out here in the boonies with little or no\nhelp at all, unless I offer money to someone to come 40 miles.\nRelocating to the closest major city has also been an exercise in\nfutility. \n     Maybe I haven't found the info yet, but is there a way to use the\nnew USB synthesizers they're coming out with now?  As far as I've\nmanaged to see in the SpeakUp docs, only serial port models and internal\nmodels are supported  I'm hoping there's something simple, like\nappending something to the lilo boot prompt to have it communicate with \na USB port.   I dunno yet.  Lots more to read up on.\n\n     Thank you again for all the help,\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
