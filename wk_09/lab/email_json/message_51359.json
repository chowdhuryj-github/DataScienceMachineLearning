You will get very close to 2x speed up if you have enough \n(and fast enough) RAM.\n\n> During our discussion one mentioned that RAM is important.

Even my\n2.5 year old laptop has 1Gb, and I'd want at least 2Gb in a dual processor \nmachine given that spec.  My sysadmin suggests a minimum of 4Gb for 64-bit \ndual processors these days.\n\n> Am I right?\n>\n> Best,\n> Rob\n>\n>\n>\n>> I have little doubt that a Pentium 4 would be much slower\n>> than the others.\n>>\n>> I've just bought an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 primarily to run\n>> 64-bit Linux, but it also has Vista 64 and XP (32-bit) on it.\n>>  I don't think the differences between the current dual-core\n>> chips are really enough to worry about: they will all look\n>> slow in less than a year.\n>>\n>> --\n>> Brian D.
