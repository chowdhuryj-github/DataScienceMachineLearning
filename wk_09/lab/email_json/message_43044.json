I might be able to\nfinish sometime later, but if someone beats me to it I won't be\ndispleased ;-)\n\nJust as a note to the list (and in some sense myself) we need categories for:\n\n - Tru64, OpenSolaris, a tag to specify 32 or 64 bit, IntelMac (in platforms)\n - imcc, pir (in languages)\n - RFE, CAGE, PGE, TGE, PDD (in tags)\n\nPaul\n\n"}
