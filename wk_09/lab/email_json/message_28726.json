Mia was pregnant. She was facing a delivery situation. I rented a car to take her to hospital. We were both delighted. Everything looked fresh and new again. I hadn't yet reached the main road when two policemen stopped me. They told me that I couldn't go ahead. On my humble inquiry they told me that a member of the Politburo was to travel through this road so the passage was closed for general public.
