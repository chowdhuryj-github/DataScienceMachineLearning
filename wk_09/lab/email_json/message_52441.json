This helps quite often to spot \nsome mistakes yourself. This is my own experience and has been \nexperienced by others, see, for example:\nlibrary(fortunes)\nfortune(\"Ripleyed\")\n\n  :-)\n\nFor example, mention that you are (probably?) using the package 'nnet'.\n\nnicole baerg wrote:\n> I get the coefficients.

I guess the list should look similar to this:\n  [1] \"n\"             \"nunits\"        \"nconn\"         \"conn\"\n  [5] \"nsunits\"       \"decay\"         \"entropy\"       \"softmax\"\n  [9] \"censored\"      \"value\"         \"wts\"           \"fitted.values\"\n[13] \"residuals\"     \"lev\"           \"call\"          \"terms\"\n[17] \"weights\"       \"deviance\"      \"rank\"          \"coefnames\"\n[21] \"vcoefnames\"    \"contrasts\"     \"xlevels\"       \"edf\"\n[25] \"AIC\"\n\n\n\n> \n> Also can you change the speficiation of the base category without recoding?\n> \nCheck\n?relevel\n\nI hope this helps,\nRoland\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
