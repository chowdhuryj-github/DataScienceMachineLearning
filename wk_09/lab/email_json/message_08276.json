The 'state' variable is the\ncontext for the overall ctdb_call. The idea is to make the incoming\nreply packet (andd everthing else associated with this call) a child\nof that state, so that when the call is finished the packet goes away\nas well.\n\nIf we are leaking memory, then I suspect the real problem is a missing\ntalloc_free() somewhere else. I'll have a look this morning and see if\nI can spot it.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
