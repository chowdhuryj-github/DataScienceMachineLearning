I've committed a fix and will upload a new version soon.\n\n> Is there a simple solution to get filled points un the key ?\n\nIn your example, adding this should work:\n\npar.settings = list(grid.pars = list(fill = \"grey\")),\n\nbut this won't work for more than one fill color.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
