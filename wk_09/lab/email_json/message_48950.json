Just need to keep a copy of links I wand sed to remove in a\nfile called, \"www.google.com.links.deny\".  Ain't that a mouthful.\n  I've been wanting to use that script ever since I started using\nWin-Eyes and had no choice but to tab through each and every link to get\nto the edit box.  Yeah, there's probably a quicker way with the browse\nmode keys, but I don't plan to keep using Windows...or anything else I\nhave little or no control over.\n     Anyway, it sounds like the only place I found that sells the\nDoubleTalk LT is no longer displaying it for sale.  Either that or\nthey're temporarily out of stock.  Story of my life, trying to get this\nstinker running.  Can't believe I've been at it since  January...\n\n         Michael\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
