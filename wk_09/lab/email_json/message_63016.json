The value for \\chi^2 is then compared to a table of \ncritical values.  The table in his book is a subset of Table 51 in \nPearson and Hartley 1976, Biometrica Tables for Statisticians vol II, \ndescribed as \"Percentage points of the extreme roots of \n$|\\text{\\textbf{S}}\\Sigma^{-1}-c\\text{\\textbf{I}}|=0$\"\n\nIs there an easy way of doing this test in R?  My main problem in \nthat Table 51 only gives values for a maximum of a p=10, \\nu = 200 \ntable and mine are regularly much bigger than that (although it would \nbe also nice to be able to put in the figures for lambda, n, p and \n\\nu and get the probability back).\n\nMany thanks in advance, Kris Lockyear.\n\nDr Kris Lockyear\nInstitute of Archaeology\n31-34 Zombie Square\nLondon\n\nphone: 020 7679 4568\nemail: k.lockyear@ucl.ac.uk\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
