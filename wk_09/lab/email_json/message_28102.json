When I became 18 I broke friendship with my group\nmate, because I found out that she was having an affair with a man, who is\n30 and left his wife with two kids!\nNow I hope that I've finally met man of my dreams, you, and even if you are\nmarried or already have a girlfriend, I am ready to take you away and leave\nonly for me, for my love and warmth!  I changed my opinion and I am willing\nto start a relationship with you at http://inetfeelings.com/fantasy. \nFind me there and tell me a bit about your dreams.\n\n\nLooking forward to get a letter from you\nNastyunya\n\n\n"}
