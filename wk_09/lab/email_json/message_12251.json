I thought of\ngiving this a go but the Debian iso loads very few drivers\nin the initrd and the audio subsystem isn't one of them. \nThe kernel used is 2.6.18 with the Debian patches as on the\nofficial iso.  I'm hoping this will work with the Dectalk\nbut let me know if it doesn't and I'll add the new driver\nrecently committed into CVS.\n\nThe CD does not add any extra entries to sources.list not\nadded by the official image.\n\nHth,\nShane\n\nOn Sat, Apr 21, 2007 at 01:31:06PM -0500, Nick Gawronski wrote:\n> Hi, I am going to need to reinstall debian etch and am downloading the net\n> installation image.
