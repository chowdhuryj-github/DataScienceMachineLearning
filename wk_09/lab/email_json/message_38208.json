So we have the regressor matrix X. If the fitted lm object is lmobj, the inverse of the matrix t(X)%*%X is xx, and the residual variance is sigma^2_e, the variance-covariance matrix of the OLS estimate of the coefficients is given by:\nxx*sigma^2_e\nI saw that what the function vcov actually does is simply:\nvcov=summary(lmobj)$sigma^2 * summary(lmobj)$cov.unscaled\nSo the cov.unscaled component should give the matrix xx. I am right?\nI tried inverting the matrix t(X)%*%X with solve by issuing:\nsolve(t(X)%*%X), but I get a matrix quite different from the matrix given by cov.unscaled. Is it just computational instability, or I am missing something important?\n\nRegards,\nMartin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
