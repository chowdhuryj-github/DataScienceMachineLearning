I'm fairly new to Perl and everything I know\nis learnt off the web. I've done stuff like `&myFunction` for zero\nparam functions and going from that to `&myFunction()` isn't such a\nleap.\nI suspect one of the tutorials that Google or Perl.org points to has\nsomething in it that needs correcting.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
