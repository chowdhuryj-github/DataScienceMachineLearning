The idea is use the website for contests, creating an archive of user contributed artwork that can be freely used and included in upcoming Debian releases.\nThe artwork should be pleasant, yet unintrusive. Ideally, it should work well with the default user interface of the three major desktops: GNOME, KDE and Xfce; but there's also room for more generic Debian related artwork like t-shirts, labels and system sounds.\nFor example, the Debian Desktop team can create contests for create packages of popular files.The user can put the follows categories:- Wallpaper- Splash screen- Icon- System sound- Logo\n\n- Usplash- T-shirt- Screenshot- GenericWhat do you think? We think this is one of the available ways for a best desktop....Can you test? Please register and put your artworking :DThanks to Valessio Brito and Gustavo Franco by their precious help !!!\nLinks:[1] - http://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2007/04/msg00045.html[2] - \nhttp://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktopArtwork[3] - \nhttp://www.debianart.org[4] - http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-desktop/\n-- Andre Luiz Rodrigues Ferreira (si0ux) <andrelrf@gmail.com> *******************************************************************\nOrlandia - SP - Brazil\n\"Unix is user friendly...
