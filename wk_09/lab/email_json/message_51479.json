I also examined pdDiag(th1 + th2~1) for another model (mod3) and based on the anova the original mod1 is preferred.\n\nMy question is can I use pdBlocked with only 2 random effects or should I and if so how I would specify that in the model or perhaps the 95% ci for correlation is wide enough to ignore???\n\nDan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
