For user data, you can enable/disable\nposix fcntl locking calls using the usual Samba method of setting\n\"posix locking = yes/no\". \n\nSo it doesn't matter what distributed locking system GFS uses.\n\n > Is it possible use a load balance hardware for distribute load\n > among nodes?\n\nyes, and it's probably a very good idea. The basic Samba/CTDB setup\npresents a system that looks very much like a single multi-homed\nbox. If you want it to appear as a single IP address then a load\nbalancing switch would be ideal. We haven't tested with that setup\nyet, but it should work very well. Please let us know how it goes.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
