", "body": "# New Ticket Created by  Andy Spieherty \n# Please include the string:  [perl #42616]\n# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. \n# \n\n\nWhat version of perl is supposed to be required to build parrot?  \nAccording to README, \n\n    You'll also need Perl 5.6.1 or above to run various configure and\n    build scripts.\n\nAccording to Configure, \n\n    use 5.006_001;\n\nBut if you actually try it with perl-5.6.2, the build proceeds for a\nwhile and then dies with\n\n    perl5.6 tools/build/pmc2c.pl --vtable\n    \"longmess\" is not exported by the Carp module at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PCCMETHOD.pm line 8\n    Can't continue after import errors at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PCCMETHOD.pm line 8\n    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PCCMETHOD.pm line 8.\n    Compilation failed in require at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c.pm line 29.\n    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c.pm line 29.\n    Compilation failed in require at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Library.pm line 29.\n    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Library.pm line 29.\n    Compilation failed in require at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Utils.pm line 9.\n    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /home/spiehera/src/parrot/parrot-andy/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Utils.pm line 9.\n    Compilation failed in require at tools/build/pmc2c.pl line 12.\n    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at tools/build/pmc2c.pl line 12.\n    *** Error code 255\n    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `vtable.dump'\n\nWhat is the actual intent?  Requiring builders to run at least perl-5.8\ndoes not seem unreasonable to me, but neither would requiring\ndevelopers to stick with perl-5.6 seem unreasonable.  Parrot should,\nhowever, be consistent.\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
