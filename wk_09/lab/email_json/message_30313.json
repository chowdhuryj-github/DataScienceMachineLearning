I am using the (I think)\nstandard command:\n\ndata_150<-read.table(\"y_complete06000\", header=FALSE)\n\nwhere y_complete06000 is a 6000 by 40 table of numbers.\nI am puzzled at the fact that R is taking several minutes to read this file.\nFirst I thought it may have been due to its shape, but even\nre-expressing and saving the matrix as a 1D array does not help.\nIt is not a small file, but not even huge (it amounts to about 5Mb of\ntext file).\nIs there anything I can do to speed up the file reading?\nMany thanks\n\nLorenzo\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
