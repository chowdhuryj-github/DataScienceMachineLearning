Would this give me the same\nanswer likelihood wise, of optimizing both\njointly with the restriction ? This methodology doesn't sound right to\nme. Thanks.\n\nP.S : abs(A + beta) also has to be less than 1  but I was just going to\nhope for that and not worry about it right now.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
