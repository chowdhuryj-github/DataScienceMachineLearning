It shows that it's using synaptics.  \nHow do I find the synaptics driver to alter the configuration \nparameters.  What's synclient and [gq]synaptics and where do I find them? \nNext question.  Once  I get to them are they gui interfaces or do they \nhave to be altered from the root terminal? \n\nJim\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
