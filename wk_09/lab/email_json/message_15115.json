I am trying to install ubuntu 7.04, and was \nwondering if someone here can help.  An over-the-phone walk through \nwould be awesome, but will settle for E-mail.  Here is my \nproblem:  When I boot the live cd and enter a terminal, speech seems \nto be fine.  When I follow instructions I found on the orca wiki, \nthat say to enter \"sudo su, unload orca, then type \"orca --no-setup \n--disable main-window\", I get the welcome, then a message that says, \n\"switching to focus tracking mode\", then no speech.  If anyone can \nhelp, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks much,\n\n\nGuy\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
