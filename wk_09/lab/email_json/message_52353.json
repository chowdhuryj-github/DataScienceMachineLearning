The trouble\nwith the current specification is that it draws attention to this\n'exception'!

That'll surprise people when they try to do that\n  and it doesn't work.  I should object!\n\n* Hmmm, now there's this third type of comment as well.  What on earth\n  is that for?\n\nUntil it twigged.  If I hadn't read the spec then everything would just\nhave worked naturally!\n\nSmylers\n\n"}
