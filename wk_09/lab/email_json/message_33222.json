In particular, there are several new  \nsubdirectories of tests under t/ whose purposes have not yet been  \ndocumented in t/README.  These subdirectories are:\n\n           'dynoplibs',\n           'oo',\n           'pdd15oo',\n           'postconfigure',\n           'stm'\n\nSince I created the postconfigure/ subdirectory, I'll start by  \nwriting a patch describing what the tests in that directory are for.   \nIf you worked on one of the other 4 undocumented subdirectories,  \nplease submit a patch as well.\n\nThank you very much.\nkid51\n\n"}
