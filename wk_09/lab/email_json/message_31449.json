Not just Array, but also Seq can typically bind to both @ and $.\n\n2.  Not just Hash, but also [Mapping,Set,Bag,Pair,etc] can bind to \nboth % and $.\n\nSo its not just Array and Hash with the extra sigils, while \neverything else has only the $.\n\nI now recommended that the Synopsis be updated to explicitly clarify \nsuch as these details, to make things less ambiguous for future \nreaders, and they don't make the same mis-assumptions that I did \nabout the limited scope of @ and % use.\n\nThat is, the Synopsis should explicitly state which are all the \nbuilt-in types that could typically bind to each of the sigils (and \neverything can bind to $).\n\nLarry thought that perhaps S02 would be the place for it.\n\nIn conclusion, I retract my previous suggestion of just using $ where \nwe used to use @ and %.\n\n-- Darren Duncan\n\n"}
