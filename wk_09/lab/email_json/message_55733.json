Second, when I untar'd the\nopt-samba-3.0.25a-AIX.tar I only got one .bff file. Is this all there\nis? Seems to me to be a big jump. Does 25a have all of the changes\nneeded between 10 and 25a? I've never installed samba and don't know\nmuch about it. Do I need to remove 3.0.10 first. I didn't see that on\nthe instructions. I'm all set to install on a test box, but, I'm afraid\nto pull the trigger. \n \nThanks for your help,\n\nMartin Liserio\n\nRBC Dain Information Services\n\nAssoc.
