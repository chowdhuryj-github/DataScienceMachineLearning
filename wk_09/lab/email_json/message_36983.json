I know that Gentoo can run SSHD, and let me do the install manually with another machine, but Deebian doesn't seem to do this.\nDoes anybody have any advice?\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
