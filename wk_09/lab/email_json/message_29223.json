Some use can be in\nrle function e.g.\n\n> apply(apply(ac,2,function(x) (is.na(x))),2, function(x)\nrle(x)$values[1])\n   V1    V2    V3    V4    V5 \nFALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE \n\ngives you columns which start with NA and\n\n> apply(apply(ac,2,function(x) (is.na(x))),2, function(x)\nrle(x)$lengths[1])\nV1 V2 V3 V4 V5\n 9  6  6  5 10 \n>\n\ngives you length of NA consecutive sequence in each column. Then you can\n\nelaborate a condition which will compute rowSums differently for a \nparticular row. E.g. when there is a TRUE value take a number for that \ngiven column and increase it by one. You will get row number for which\nyou \nneed rowSum with and without this particular column.\n\nRegards\n\nPetr Pikal\npetr.pikal@precheza.cz\n\nr-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch napsal dne 14.05.2007 08:23:01:\n\n> Hi,\n>    Apologies for the long mail.
