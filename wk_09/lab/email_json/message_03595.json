Or should\nthey only use such measures to deal with AIDS, a disease that has\ndrawn considerable high profile attention among politicians and\ncelebrities.\n\nThere is no medical reason why Thailand should only use compulsory\nlicenses to obtain inexpensive generics for the treatment of AIDS.\nPeople in Thailand suffer from all sorts of diseases, including\neverything we face here, and the prices charged by big drug companies\nare far beyond that which the average wage earner in Thailand can\nafford. This is the reality on the ground in almost every developing\ncountry, where drug companies typically target wealthy elites when\nsetting prices.\n\nIn order to give their letter an appearance of the moral high ground,\nthe Senators offer what is part of the big lie strategy put forth by\npharmaceutical industry PR agents. The Senators \"do not believe that\nWTO members intended those rules to be used to allow compulsory\nlicenses on any medicine whatsoever as a matter of standard\ngovernment policy. . . \" In fact, as is well known by Lieberman's own\nstaff, the WTO rules on patents and compulsory licenses clearly allow\nprecisely the measures that Thailand has undertaken. There is no\nlimit on the scope of diseases in the WTO TRIPS agreement, and\nindeed, no requirement that compulsory licenses even be limited to\npatents on medicines.\n\nThe day after Thailand was criticized by these Senators, Italy issued\ncompulsory licenses\n[ http://www.agcm.it/agcm_eng/COSTAMPA/E_PRESS.NSF/\n92e82eb9012a8bc6c125652a00287fbd/28653b373e56772ac12572ab003a4d68 ]\nfor patents on a drug used to treat prostate problems. Since June of\n2006, the U.S. government has issued compulsory licenses on patents\nat least five times, including licenses on patents for software,\nDirect TV's set-top box, a Toyota transmission, a J&J medical device,\nand computer memory chips. None of these were mentioned in the\nSenator's letter, which says that Thailand's actions \"raise grave\nconcerns about the investment climate in Thailand.\" [These and more\nexamples here:\nhttp://www.keionline.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41 ]\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy Thompson, the former DHHS Secretary and current\nRepublican candidate for President, has also criticized the Thailand\ngovernment, but on March 23 he also offered this good advice:\n\n     \"In this increasingly complex environment, governments also have\na duty to talk and exercise diplomacy to address not only this\nsymptom, but to put into place a framework that considers the larger\nglobal public health need -- the balancing act between innovation and\naccess.\"\n\nTommy Thompson's comment points to a positive way forward. The World\nHealth Organization has created a new \"Intergovernmental Working\nGroup\" or IGWG, to look at precisely these issues -- how does one\nreconcile both innovation and access, when most of the world's\npopulation earns so little? The Congress should look at the IGWG\nprocess and come up with something more appealing than telling most\nof the world they deserve second-class access to medicines for\ndiseases it's not currently fashionable to care about.\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
