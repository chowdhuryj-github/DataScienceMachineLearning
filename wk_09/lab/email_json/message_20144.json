You already\nhave the data... why shove it out as a filehandle and back in line by line,\nwhen all you need to do is split the data up by lines?\n\nstring-as-filehandle is mostly to work around legacy systems that want a\nfilehandle but you actually want the data in memory.  Don't invent *new*\ninterfaces that *require* their use.  Ugh.\n\n-- \nRandal L.
