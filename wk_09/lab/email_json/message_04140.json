Yes, Fedora did notice my \nWindows  partition.  The problem was that the way that Lenovo made the  \npartitions, according\nto my Linux instructor, meant that we had to break  the existing \npartitions before installing Linux and then fix grub to  recognize what \nwe had done.\nThe computer was broken into one 30  gigabyte partition and another 90 \nGB partition.  Since there wasn't  enough room on the smaller partition, \nwe had\nto use the bigger one in  order to put Linux on one 45 GB partition and \nWindows on the other 45 GB  partion we then made. this meant that we had \nto temporarily\nremove  Windows to build the new partitions.  Then when I tried to run \nthe XP installer, either the newer hardware on the Thinkpad wasn't \nrecognized, and also, Windows wouldn't even recognize that I had a Linux \npartition at all.  I really don't know why we  couldn't find another way \nto do this other than using a utility to  re-partition\nthe disk before installing. I'm not knowledgeable enough to  know if we \ncould have done it better. but my instructor said we  had to \nbreakt the\nbig partition in half so that Windows had half and  Linux had half.  \nThat part confused me a little because I didn't  understand why he \ncouldn't break\nup the partition right there and then,  and save my Windows \ninstallation,but he said no, so we started by  breaking up the big \npartition with the Fedora\ninstaller and then  reinstalling Windows.  Here is where things got \nweird and now we're  rebuilding the system.  If nothing else, it's a \nlearning experience.\n\n\nBeth\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
