Interesting that EU was quick to approve Yentreve on very weak\nevidence but Lilly actually withdrew their US application because they\nunderstood that FDA would not approve it....\n\nThere are probably several reasons for this trend. I worry that by giving\npsychotropic drugs different brand names, doctors forget that they are\nactually prescribing 'strong medicines' for non-psychiatric disorders.\n\nThis reference was sent from a colleague directly to Sue Rochman:\n\nhttp://www.pjonline.com/pdf/spectrum/pj_20070203_dualbranding.pdf\n\n\nKirsten Myhr, MScPharm, MPH\nUlleval University Hospital\nNorway\n\n-----Opprinnelig melding-----\nFra: ip-health-admin@lists.essential.org\n[mailto:ip-health-admin@lists.essential.org]Pa vegne av Sue Rochman\nSendt: 19. mai 2007 17:17\nTil: ip-health@lists.essential.org\nEmne: [Ip-health] drug naming/patents/exclusivity\n\nAlso, can anyone explain, or recommend someone who can comment on, the\nbenefits that pharmaceutical companies get (patent or exclusivity\nextensions or otherwise) when they remarket a drug with a new name or\nfor a new use?\n\nThanks,\nSue Rochman\nFreelance Medical/Health Writer\nsue.rochman@earthlink.net\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
