It is good form to\nhandle assigning arguments to lexical variables early in a subroutine:\n\nsub stop_it {\n        my ($vm) = @_;\n        my $state = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \"$vm\" getstate -q`;\n        .\n        .\n        .\n}\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
