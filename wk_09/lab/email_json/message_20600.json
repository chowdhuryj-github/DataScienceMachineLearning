Let's try this again.\n\n As a capacitive sensor, when the environment changes, the capacitive\ntouchpad will need recalibration. The B2 and before touchpads do not\nauto-calibrate.\n 1) if you have your finger on the touchpad during power-on, you can\ncause problems.\n 2) the calibration may shift when you go to/from battery power, or\nafter resuming from suspend (not yet deployed).\n\nTo force a recalibration of the touchpad, you perform what we call the\n\"four finger salute\".  To recalibrate, press all four keys at the\ncorners of the keyboard at the same time, pressing the \"fn\" key last,\nwhile keeping your fingers off the touchpad.\n\nBTest-3 and beyond will automatically recalibrate.  We received samples\nof the BTest-3 touchpads late last week, and have installed several, and\nare happy so far with their behavior.\n\nRemember: please leave the (slightly off color) plastic sheet on the\ntouchpad; it does make the touchpads work much better.\n\nOn Mon, 2007-04-30 at 19:38 -0400, Jim Gettys wrote:\n> As a capacitive sensor, when the environment changes, the capacitive\n> touchpad will need recalibration.
