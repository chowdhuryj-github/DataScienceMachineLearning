Now I'm trying to work out how\nthese failures have happened.\n\nI think some of this could be because of a problem with the mirrors\n(though I've tried both UK(London) and Switzerland(Zurich)).  I have\nseen the posting saying that there are problems.  I also think some\ncould be because I may have installed some packages under 2.4.1 which\ndidn't come from CRAN but I didn't keep careful records stupidly.\n\nAnyway, looking at http://cran.r-project.org/ packages I think that:\n'dynamicGraph', 'ggplot', 'ref', 'stats4' and 'Design' should all be\nthere for me to install with install.packages() but they're definitely\nnot at UK(London) or Switzerland(Zurich).\n\nSearching a bit I can see that Qtoolbox was a non-CRAN package I\ninstalled directly.\n\nHowever, I still seem to have created some warnings here that searching\nthe R site search isn't answering for me.\n\nTwo questions/suggestions:\n1) is there a list somewhere of packages/libraries that were once in R\nbut aren't now?\n2) is there a way of checking for missing dependencies that will\nidentify both what's missing (clearly something like this is producing\nwarning 2 following my call of \"install.packages(ip)\") but might also\nproduce a list of the origins of the dependencies?\n\nSorry if these are trivial issues.\n\nTIA,\n\nChris\n\n\n-- \nChris Evans  Skype: chris-psyctc\nProfessor of Psychotherapy, Nottingham University;\nConsultant Psychiatrist in Psychotherapy, Notts PDD network;\nResearch Programmes Director, Nottinghamshire NHS Trust;\nHon.
