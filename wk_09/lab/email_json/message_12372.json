PETERSBURG, Fla., April 20 /PRNewswire/ -- A shipment of 67\nCroatian Naive reverse glass paintings destined for the recently opened\nCroatian Naive Art Gallery & Museum Collection in St. Petersburg, Florida,\nwas reported missing in the capitol city of Zagreb, Croatia yesterday. The\nlarge wooden crate measuring approximately 100CM (36\") square and weighing\n210 Kilos (462 lbs.) was picked up from the packing company by FedEx in\nZagreb on April 11th and expected to arrive at its final destination in St.\nPetersburg on Saturday, April 14th or sooner. Eleven paintings from the\npersonal collection of prominent Croatian art critic Marijan Spoljar were\nthe \"heart\" of the shipment. The remainder of the 67 paintings was from\nabout 12 of the most famous Croatian Naive artists alive today, many of\nwhom are considered Modern Masters. FedEx has been unable to locate the\ncrate in either Frankfurt or Paris, two possible first European stops for\nshipments to the US. The Gallery is optimistic the shipment will simply\nshow up, but fears that it was stolen are creeping in as the 9th day\nmissing draws to a close.\n    Croatian Naive Art is a genre of art begun in the late 1920s\npredominantly by self-taught farmer artists where the artist paints in\nreverse in oils on the back side of a normal piece of glass. The artist\nmust sign his signature first backwards so that when you view the finished\nwork from the front it reads properly. Details and foreground are also done\nbefore anything else. Former communist suppression has kept this art form a\nEuropean phenomenon until now. Most Croatian Naive Artists have been\npainting for 35-50 years and are internationally recognized as having taken\nthis art form to the highest level.\n    Contact: Sue Cooper-Street, Director, Croatian Naive Art Gallery &\nMuseum Collection, 300 Beach Drive N.E., St. Petersburg, FL 33701,\n727-824-2800, Nannen@CroatianNaiveArt.com , Web site:\nhttp://www.CroatianNaiveArt.com\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Sun, 22 Apr 2007 07:45:33 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] India, Others, Step Up Antiquities Scrutiny\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <462AF67D.7000705@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n\n    India, Others, Step Up Antiquities Scrutiny\n\nBY BRADLEY HOPE - Staff Reporter of the Sun\nApril 20, 2007\n\nThe Republic of India has stepped up its scrutiny of New York's \ninternational antiquities trade, a senior consulate official said during \nan interview this week.\n\nOver the past three years, the consulate has forged a closer \nrelationship with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and several \ninvestigations into smuggled antiquities are under way in the city, the \ndeputy consul general of the consulate, A.R. Ghanashyam, said.\n\n\"There was a time when people in villages would not even contemplate \nthat things like this, objects in temples, could sell in a New York \nmarket,\" Mr. Ghanashyam said. \"Over the last years, with increased \ntourist traffic and globalization, pieces are disappearing.\"\n\nA senior special agent at ICE, James McAndrew, said India is part of a \ngroup of countries, including Thailand and Peru, that is scrutinizing \nthe antiquities trade to a higher degree than in the past. With the \nfiling of high-profile cultural property claims recently involving \nItaly, Greece, and Egypt ? countries that have long been proactive about \nrecovering antiquities they say were looted ? other countries are \nstarting to test the waters for claims of their own, he said.\n\n\"The antiquities trade has turned a corner,\" Mr. McAndrew said. \"In my \nmind, I see a domino effect. Sooner or later, I see other countries \ntrying to model Italy's success at recovering artifacts.\"\n\nOn April 17, 2006, a stolen Vishnu statue worth about $30,000 was turned \nover by ICE to the Indian government. The 250-pound sandstone statue was \ntaken from a temple in the city of Mandsaur in the Madhya Pradesh state \nof India sometime in 2000, according to published reports. Mr. McAndrew \nwas able to trace the statue to a New York gallery owner, Namkha Dorjee, \nwho voluntarily surrendered the object to the government. It was being \nstored in a warehouse in Queens.\n\nNo one was charged with a crime because the original smuggler was \nmurdered in Afghanistan during the course of the investigation. He was \nallegedly involved with another smuggling operation there, Mr. McAndrew \nsaid.\n\nSince that investigation began in 2003, Indian officials have \nincreasingly issued alerts about objects that may be heading to New \nYork, which is one of the largest markets for antiquities collectors in \nthe world, Mr. McAndrew said.\n\nMr. Ghanshyam said discussions were ongoing in India about how to better \nsecure artifacts in remote villages, some of which had never been \ndocumented. It is virtually impossible to legally export an ancient \nobject from India because permits to do so are never issued, he said.\n\nCustoms officials there are starting to use new technology to monitor \noutgoing shipments, and legislators are considering increasing the \npenalties for smuggling antiquities by amending the Antiquities and Art \nTreasures Act of 1972, Mr. Ghanashyam said.\n\nTwo New York gallery owners interviewed yesterday said they believe \nantiquities should be better protected in their home countries, but that \nthe laws shouldn't restrict trade of antiquities altogether.\n\n\"There is a lot of good to this,\" the co-owner of E&J Frankel, Joel \nFrankel, said. \"But, I'm still one of the old believers that sometimes \nwhen you make rules and laws too tight, nothing gets out, and the rest \nof the world doesn't have any idea of what material that country produces.\"\n\nMr. Frankel said he regularly turns away people who come to his gallery \nwith objects that have unreliable histories, but that some collectors \nare willing to turn a blind eye.\n\nAnother gallery owner, Joseph Gerena, said: \"So far the thrust of it has \nbeen overdramatized to demonize the collectors, museums, and dealers.\" \nThe world is in danger of the \"balkanization of culture\" if pieces are \nhorded in the countries from which they originate, he said.\n\nAdvocates of restricting the antiquities trade say the private market \nfor ancient artifacts drives improper excavation around the world. The \nworks can be damaged or slip from smuggler to collector without having \never been seen by an archaeologist or art historian, they say.\n\nhttp://www.nysun.com/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Sun, 22 Apr 2007 07:46:07 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Aydin Ibrahimov?s punishment commuted\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <462AF69F.8020804@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n* Aydin Ibrahimov?s punishment commuted *\n\n*****[ 20 Apr 2007 19:59  ]*\n\n* Preliminary court proceeding on case of Aydin Ibrahimov, who is \naccused of stealing art works from State Art Museum, was held at \nAzerbaijani Court of Grave Crimes, APA reports. *\n\nOgtay Gerekmezli, lawyer for Ibrahimov petitioned for commuting his \narrest to house arrest taking into consideration his disease and \ncontributions for the country.

Budget cut leads to vain quest for private backers\n? Specialist unit accorded 'very low priority'\n\nSandra Laville , crime correspondent\nSaturday April 21, 2007\nThe Guardian\n\nThe dramatic scaling down of Scotland Yard's once renowned arts and \nantique squad has left organised criminals free to plunder the nation's \nheritage, according to a leading fine art insurer.\n\nPolice have sought private money to finance the squad after its annual \nbudget of some ?300,000 was halved earlier this year. But the Guardian \nhas learned that Scotland Yard has failed to secure a penny from \ninsurers or auction houses, after months of discussions.\n\nBritain's art market is second only to the US and experts claim up to \n?200m worth of stolen art and antiques are sold in the UK each year. \nInterpol estimates that art theft is the fourth largest organised crime \nafter drugs, people trafficking and arms.\n\nAnnabel Fell-Clark, chief executive of Axa Art UK, which pays out tens \nof millions of pounds a year to reimburse victims of art theft, \ncondemned the slashing of the unit's budget. She warned that scaling \ndown the unit was already having an impact on pursuing art thieves who \ntarget Britain's stately homes and museums.\n\n\"We have seen that they [the team] are increasingly overstretched and \nbeing treated as a very low priority. At the moment we have very good \ninformation which we are wanting to pass on, which would bring arrests, \nif not convictions. But we are not being treated particularly seriously, \nlet's put it that way.\n\n\"We want to see criminal gangs brought to justice, and in some instances \nlack of interest from the squad has stopped us being able to pursue \nfurther recovery. We want and need to work with the police.\"\n\nShe said Axa was aware the government was seeking funding for the squad \nbut the company had decided it would not consider paying directly for \nthe unit, adding that attempts by the Home Office and the Metropolitan \nPolice to find private sponsors in the art world were shortsighted.\n\n\"It would be a conflict of interest for us to get involved,\" she said. \n\"We have slightly different agendas. As insurers, we are interested in \nrecovering the pieces however we can, and are not that bothered about \nfinding and prosecuting the perpetrators. We are concerned that this \naspect of law enforcement is not taken particularly seriously right now.\n\n\"Very often when you are investigating art theft connections are \nuncovered with organised crime in relation to drugs and arms dealing, so \nit doesn't make sense to ignore this aspect of criminal activity.\"\n\nThe London based \"arts squad\" was formed in 1969 to pursue and prosecute \ncriminals who operate in the second biggest art market in the world. In \nthe past the unit, which is called in to investigate 120 cases a year, \nwas involved in recovery of art works across the world.\n\nAccording to art crime sources, officers from the squad worked with \nSpanish investigators to help crack one of Europe's most spectacular art \nrobberies - the theft of 19 paintings valued at ?30m from the Madrid \npenthouse of Esther Koplowitz, Marquesa of Casa Penalver and Cardenas.\n\nOther successes include the uncovering of a multimillion pound British \nsmuggling operation in which precious antiquities and archaeological \nartefacts were stolen from Egypt, some of which were sold at Sotheby's.\n\nLast year the unit arrested a gang allegedly responsible for stealing \ntens of millions of pounds of art and antiques from stately homes over \nfour years, including ?30m worth of antiques from Ramsbury Manor in \nWiltshire.\n\nMark Dodgson, of the British Antique Dealers Association, said: \"The \nidea of people in the art world funding the squad seems wrong. My \nmembers pay taxes already, and surely paying for the police is what \ntheir taxes are for.\"\n\nScotland Yard confirmed that as yet no private investors had been \nidentified to provide the 50% funding required for the unit by the next \nfinancial year.\n\nhttp://arts.guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 7\nDate: Sun, 22 Apr 2007 07:50:10 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Jail for obsessive collector who stole museum exhibits\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <462AF792.7080101@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n\n    Jail for obsessive collector who stole museum exhibits\n\n///20th April 2007, 14:15 WST\n/\n\nIt was the biggest museum theft in the nation's history, with more than \n2,000 specimens, including a skull from the now-extinct Tasmanian tiger, \nstolen from Sydney's Australian Museum.   \n\nFormer museum pest controller Hendrikus van Leeuwen, convicted of the \ntheft, was today jailed for up to seven years for what a judge described \nas \"enormous, incalculable harm\".   \n\n\"Through his selfish actions he has cost the Australian Museum not only \na great deal of money, but damaged its reputation,\" District Court Judge \nPeter Berman said in sentencing Leeuwen.   \n\n\" ... perhaps most importantly of all, (he has) caused permanent harm to \nthe ability of scientists to study many aspects of the natural history \nof Australia and the rest of the world.\"   \n\nVan Leeuwen, 50, began collecting bird and animal specimens, including \nroad-kill, as a boy in Holland, the court was told.   \n\nBut his interest became an obsession, costing him his job and, \nultimately, his freedom.   \n\nSoon after he was hired in 1996, van Leeuwen began stealing specimens \nfrom the Australian Museum whose natural history collection - the oldest \nin the country - dates back to 1827.   \n\nVan Leeuwen was \"not a very good pest controller\", according to one \nwitness.   \n\nBut he was a very successful thief.   \n\nHis haul included skulls, skins and skeletons from animals such as the \nGanges River dolphin, the clouded leopard and the rare Bulmer's Fruit \nBat.   \n\nVan Leeuwen was sacked in 2003 after the Independent Commission Against \nCorruption recovered more than 2,000 specimens in raids at his \nLondonderry home, in Sydney's west.   \n\nThe 2007 Australian of the Year, scientist and author Tim Flannery, gave \nevidence, saying he believed it was \"the largest theft of museum \nholdings every perpetrated in Australia\".   \n\nSome items were irreparably damaged, the court was told.   \n\nSome exhibits had their identifying numbers removed while others were \nbleached or, like the Tasmanian tiger skull, had teeth removed.   \n\nJudge Berman rejected van Leeuwen's claim that he took the exhibits to \nprotect them, finding he was \"obsessed\" with collecting specimens and \nsimply wanted to possess them.   \n\nMany of the exhibits - valued at more than $875,000 - were \"unique and \nirreplaceable\", the judge said.   \n\nVan Leeuwen pleaded guilty to 15 counts of stealing from his employer, \nwhile Judge Berman took another 179 offences into account in sentencing.   \n\nThe charges were representative of more than 2,000 stolen items, the \nmuseum said.   \n\nAustralian Museum Trust president Brian Sherman said the impact of the \ntheft on museum staff and the community, and the scale of the losses, \nwas \"incalculable\".   \n\n\"Such a betrayal of trust is always regrettable, but when such \ndeliberate and discriminating thefts compromise the work of hundreds of \nresearchers conducted over centuries, it is particularly heartbreaking \nfor our loyal staff,\" he said.   \n\n\"The community is also deprived of the knowledge and experience \nrepresented by these specimens.\"   \n\nVan Leeuwen must serve at least five years behind bars and will be \neligible for parole in 2012.  \n\nhttp://www.thewest.com.au/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 96\n***************************************\n\n"}
