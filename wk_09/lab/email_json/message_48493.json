As it's read long \nafter the code was compiled.\n\nIt's possible to change how a code is compiled by constant and \nsubroutine definition/declaration and prototypes and it's also \npossible to change it by \"source filters\".\n\nJenda\n===== Jenda@Krynicky.cz === http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz =====\nWhen it comes to wine, women and song, wizards are allowed \nto get drunk and croon as much as they like.\n\t-- Terry Pratchett in Sourcery\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
