I am having some\ndifficulties though. During the make test procedure a number of my\ntests fail. One of them is the 10general.t test.\n\nIt fails on lines 31 and 32 which has\n\nis system(\"exit 1;\"), 1<<8, 'system exit 1 should return 256';\nis system(\"exit 0;\"), 0, 'system exit 0 should return 0';\n\nThe errors states that both lines return a value of -1 instead of 256\nand 0 respectively.\n\nI don't understand why it would return such a thing because as far as\nI can tell it should be returning the correct value. I am using a Unix\nsystem with Solaris 9 and Oracle 10 installed.\n\nThanks for any help offerened\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
