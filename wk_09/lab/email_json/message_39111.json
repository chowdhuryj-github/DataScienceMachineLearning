(If you\u2019re into math: $350,000!)\nThat\u2019s why one question I get asked a lot is: Louis do you EVER recommend CHEAPER stocks?\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft Behind\n\n\nIf\nthe Dow had kept up with the S&P Small-Cap Index over the last 8\nyears, the Dow would stand today, not at 13,000, but at 27,000! And\nlots of conservative investors would have twice the wealth! \nIt isn\u2019t too late to catch up, as you\u2019ll learn in this report. \n\n\n\n\nThe\nanswer is yes absolutely! Indeed, this is an especially good time to\nbuy lower-priced stocks. You see, as the blue chips rise, their\ncheaper, smaller brethren soar.\n\nIndeed,\nsince January, smaller-cap, lower-priced stocks are outpacing the Dow\nstocks by 50%. And for the last decade, lower priced stocks have out\nperformed the Dow by 7-to-1.\nWhy?\nSmaller lower priced stocks have been able to grow earnings at warp speed!\nUnencumbered\nby legacy concerns such as pension liabilities and a unionized labor\nforce, management can focus on responding to market demands.\nThat\u2019s why the stocks I recommend in Emerging Growth have just posted 150% annual earnings growth on average this quarter!\nJust\ncompare that to the 9% average growth of the S&P 500 and you\u2019ll see\nwhy the smaller, lower-priced guys are zooming ahead!\nI recommend a portfolio of lower priced (not low-priced, as I\u2019ll explain in a moment) stocks today especially because:\n\nthe Fed is likely to cut rates this year, igniting a big boom in smaller stocks generally\nmerger mania is sweeping the market, and smaller companies are being snapped up at big premiums\nAnd\nthe digitization of the exchanges has shrunk the bid/ask spread to a\npoint where lower-priced stocks are hyper-responsive to buying pressure.\n\nThe Case AGAINST\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese Stocks\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Growth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBAGS DOUBLERS,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTRIPLERS AND QUADRUPLERS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUNDER $24\nJust in the past year, our system has correctly identified these low-priced winners:\n\n\nCompany\nStock Price\nSold for\n\n\nXTO Energy\n$11.25\n287.29% PROFIT\n\n\nEnterra Energy\n$5.56\n273.56% PROFIT\n\n\nNoble Energy\n$13.60\n160.74% PROFIT\n\n\nUrban Outfitters\n$10.48\n158.71% PROFIT\n\n\nTesoro Corp\n$23.32\n150.30% PROFIT\n\n\nSun Hydraulic\n$9.71\n130.07% PROFIT\n\n\nAutodesk Inc\n$17.93\n103.74% PROFIT\n\n\nFrontline\n$21.20\n96.23% PROFIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are already familiar with my research, so you know: I hate uncontrollable risk. And stocks under $5 or $10, listed on the Pink Sheets or the Vancouver Exchanges, are my definition of out-of-control risk!\nMost of the time, I\u2019d rather juggle chainsaws at a baby shower.\nLet me show you the four keys to success with lower priced stocks.\nKEY #1: Nothing under $4, nothing over $24. Stocks under $4 are hockey pucks for the traders and we\u2019re not traders here at Emerging Growth.\nOver $24 and these companies are just a little beyond the inflection\npoint in their growth. But in between, you\u2019ve probably found a company\nthat\u2019s out of the garage\u2014but still under the radar.\n\nThink: Dell at $11 in September, 1990, which is when Emerging Growth subscribers snapped it up. Then think about the $22,000,000 that a $100,000 grub stake in Dell would have become. Got the idea? Ok, let\u2019s look at\u2026\n\nKEY #2. Extremely strong sales growth.\nNothing less than 50% will do here\u2014and 100% is better. Why? This rate\nof sales growth signifies market acceptance. By their nature, these are\ninnovative companies, but we don\u2019t want the RISKS of innovation\n(especially the waiting!).\n\nExample:\nApple spent $500 million on the ill-fated Newton PDA before it was\npulled off the shelves. That made Apple a dangerously expensive stock\nat $9, which is where it languished for most of the decade before the\niPod era.\nBut when the iPod sales kicked in, we bought\u2014and rode the stock up to $85.\n\nKEY #3. Exploding margins. The stocks I\u2019ve uncovered in Emerging Growth\nare currently improving operating margin at a 200% clip\u2014or close. This\nmeans that the strong sales are not being bought at too high a price.\n\nExample:\nWe were impressed with Hansen Natural soft drinks business when it was\na $4 stock, posting sales that were doubling. But the clincher was the\nrate at which Hansen was growing its margins in 2004-\u2014Emerging Growth subscribers have multiplied their money 10 TIMES since then.\n\nKEY #4. The Holy Grail: earnings growth. Expanding operating earnings generally lead to earnings growth going at warp-speed.\nA\ngood clue here is to track how analysts are revising their consumers\nearnings estimates. The more they do this, and the bigger their\nadjustments, the more you can be certain that the stock will pop on\nearnings surprise at the end of the quarter\u2014and hand you windfall\nprofits.\n\nExample:\nHolly, the refinery, was a $12 stock with 105% sales growth and profit\nmargins doubling when we bought it. Analysts were so befuddled, they\ncouldn\u2019t revise their earnings growth numbers fast enough. That\u2019s when\nwe knew we had to step in. The stock\u2019s up over 400% since.\n\nThese are our 4 keys to success with lower-priced stocks.\nWhen you join us here at Emerging Growth I will send you a just-completed report on the lower-priced stocks that are now ready for their big run. The report is called 24 Lower-Priced Doublers for 2007. And what\u2019s more\u2014it\u2019s FREE.

Take it\nfrom me: Emerging Growth became the #1 advisory for 20 years on stocks\nunder $24 that matched my 4 exclusive keys.\n\n\n\n\nWant to know how he did it?\nHis hedge fund locked up an 84% gain in 2006.\nWhich makes you wonder: What\u2019s Jim buying now?\nAnswer: A lot of one tiny company stock that Emerging Growth subscribers were snapping up before him, at around $12. (It\u2019s still at $14.)\nWhat is attracting the attention of a super-quant, crypto-analyst genius?\nFat\nIn particular, the fat on your hips and especially the fat on your stomach, where it is most liable to cause a heart attack.\nA\ntiny company (144 employees) in St. Paul, Minnesota has made a\nbreakthrough in diagnosing and managing heart attack risks.

You see, NutriSystem,\nwhich delivers every meal to your home, is a fantastic idea. The stock\nwas $20 when we bought it and it just flew through our filters. Emerging Growth subscribers are up 217% in short order in NutriSystem.\nBut this new weight-loss system should do even better\u2014because the solution is based on personalized feedback as you go through your exercise routine.\nHow Does It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWork?\nThree\nweeks ago and, I\u2019d guess, with Jim Simons\u2019 billions, this tiny\ndiagnostics company hooked up with Garmin, the GPS people.
