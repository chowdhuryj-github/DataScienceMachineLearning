The tdc->flags is DS_DOMAIN_TRUST_TYPE_UPLEVEL,\nthen it's an AD domain.  The active_directory flag in struct\nwinbindd_domain is still accurate if that is what you are relying\non.\n\n>> 4.

I thought that was what you did with the GRACE_LOGON,\ncorrect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGPyKgIR7qMdg1EfYRAjt6AJ9OVt3Tj4FTx/rJxKq1fbxDwt+/dwCg8z9I\nJYKvXId7oUy0qh6ALsXa9SQ=\n=h6Ke\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
