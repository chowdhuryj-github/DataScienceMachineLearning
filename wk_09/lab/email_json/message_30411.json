We would probably find more bugs more quickly if they did, but this can also be done by a community of users. We have a fairly active user community on the ubuntu-access and Orca lists doing just this, but more would help. The difficult part is analysing and fixing the bugs. Fortunately we have better crash repporting now (apport) which should at least help with the reporting.\n\nHenrik\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
