I sold several \non ebay last year. I would recommend looking into one of the industrial \nboards like PC104, one manufacturer that has very good prices is \nAdvantech \n\nhttp://www.advantech.com/\n\nThere are also very good deals on similar boards selling on ebay quite\nregularly, for example I've seen some sell as low as $30, and I sold \none that was a 1Ghz PC104 with 512MB ram, a dual PCMCIA add\non card, a PCMCIA wireless card, all cables and accessories, and I\nsold it for $199, it was worth much more new but I needed to get \nrid of stuff that wasn't being used. It was a nice setup but too power\nhungry for my projects.\n\nI used to do a lot of work on PC compatible small boards usually in \nthe 6x4 inch format, but now I'm working on ARM based boards,\nwith more specialized purposed, mainly due to their much lower power\nconsumption for battery operation.\n\nSet up automated searches on ebay for keywords PC104, PC/104\nand Single Board Computer and watch for a while, you'll see some \nreally good deals.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
