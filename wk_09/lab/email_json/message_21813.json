The problem with \"lines\" is that they aren't\nnecessarily lines.  But \"records\" is so 1960s...  Also, anything that\nnames the units could be seen as the count of those units in the file as\na whole rather that the number read up till now.\n\nTempted to have $io.sofar or some such...\n\n: I don't see any reference to $. in the Synopses, so I assume this is\n: not yet defined.  Apologies if I just missed it.\n\nThere's a prototype synopsis on variables out in pugs/docs/AES but it's\nstill pretty rudimentary.\n\nAs for $. itself as a variable, it's dead.  Its \"twigil\" has been stolen\nby $.foo for object attributes, and we're trying not to reuse twigils\nfor bare variable names, though it comes to mind that we have both $! and\n$!foo currently.  But there are very, very few punctuational variables\nin Perl 6 compared to Perl 5.  Most of 'em are just gone.\n\nLarry\n\n"}
