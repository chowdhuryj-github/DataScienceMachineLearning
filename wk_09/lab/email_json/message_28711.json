The thing I find most confusing about copyright is that it is\nemergent, not atomic - ie. if you split a copyrighted work into small\nenough pieces (eg. letters, pixels) those pieces are no longer\ncopyrightable.  It is the combination of those small pieces into a\nspecific form that is important, and the definition of derivative\nworks seems to help define what rearrangement of those pieces is still\ncovered under copyright.\n\nThe specific case that I am interested in creating new data sets from\npublically available data (itself stored in copyrightable works) - in\nmy case to produce interesting data sets to use in class.  For\nexample, each individual page on ebay is copyrightable, but if I\nextract the price, name and category from (say) 200 pages, does the\ncopyright of that dataset belong to ebay?  I'm quite comfortable using\nthat data personally, or for a class, but if I want to publish it (ie.\nin jse) do I need to get permission?  Similarly, if I take a few mp3's\nand calculate some summary statistics for them, would that constitute\na derivative work?\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
