For example, it's not able to make the entire shell session \navailable for reviewing, and I become restricted to the 25 lines limit of \nthe current screen.\n\nAlso, there's no way to program macros so that specific keys could read \ndifferent parts of the screen, as well as custom settings for different \napps.\n\nThere seems to be a command to read a text continuously (insert + r), \nhowever, it doesn't work fine here. It reads the first two lines of text and \nthen stops reading.\n\nWhether someone knows any solution for these problems concerning Speakup, or \nperhaps an alternate console screen reader that works with Softsynth, in \nparticular ESpeak, I'll be grateful to know.\n\nCheers,\nCleverson\n\n\"Be realistic; ask for the impossible.\" \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
