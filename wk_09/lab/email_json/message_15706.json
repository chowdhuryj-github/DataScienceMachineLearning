Thanks.\n\nIt does not mean either.\n\nIt means that the true variance of the OLS estimates is greater than the \ntrue variance of the GLS estimates.\n\nA separate issue is whether the estimated variance of an OLS estimator is \ngreater or less than the true variance of the OLS estimator.  This can go \neither way.\n\n \t-thomas\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
