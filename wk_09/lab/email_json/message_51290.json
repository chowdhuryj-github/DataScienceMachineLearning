A final round of media interviews is scheduled for 3:03 p.m. and the shuttle's KU-band antenna will be stowed for entry at 6:58 p.m., ending routine television from the orbiter.\n\nDeorbit ignition is planned for 12:50 p.m. Thursday with landing on tap at 1:55 p.m.\n\nThere are no technical problems with the space shuttle and the only question mark is the weather. As of late Tuesday, the KSC forecast called for scattered clouds at 3,000 feet, a broken deck at 5,000 feet, overcast at 12,000 feet, winds gusting to 13 knots from 210 degrees and thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles. The low ceilings and lightning activity both violate NASA's landing flight rules.\n\nAt Edwards Air Force Base in California, the outlook is favorable for the first of two Thursday opportunities, but high winds are expected to build up as the day wears on. At White Sands, N.M., forecasters are expecting a slight chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles.\n\nThe outlook in Florida remains questionable Friday and into the weekend. An updated forecast will be available later today and entry flight director Norm Knight plans to brief reporters on his entry strategy during a 5 p.m. news conference.\n\nIn the meantime, here is an updated schedule of today's activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; includes rev. P of the NASA television schedule:\n\nDAY,..EDT........DD...HH...MM...EVENT\n\n06/20/07\nWed...09:08 AM...11...13...30...Cabin stow\nWed...09:58 AM...11...14...20...Flight control system checkout\nWed...11:08 AM...11...15...30...Reaction control system hotfire\nWed...11:33 AM...11...15...55...PILOT landing practice\nWed...12:00 PM...11...16...22...NASA Video File on NTV\nWed...12:28 PM...11...16...50...Deorbit review\nWed...01:03 PM...11...17...25...Crew meal\nWed...02:03 PM...11...18...25...Cabin stow resumes\nWed...02:03 PM...11...18...25...Entry video setup\nWed...02:43 PM...11...19...05...L-1 communications check\nWed...03:03 PM...11...19...25...Media interviews\nWed...04:23 PM...11...20...45...Launch-entry suit checkout\nWed...05:00 PM...11...21...22...Mission status briefing on NTV\nWed...05:53 PM...11...22...15...Wing leading edge sensor system deactivation\nWed...06:43 PM...11...23...05...Laptop computer stow (part 1)\nWed...06:58 PM...11...23...20...KU-band antenna stow\nWed...07:08 PM...11...23...30...Ergometer stow\nWed...07:38 PM...12...00...00...Recumbent seat setup (for Williams)\nWed...09:38 PM...12...02...00...Crew sleep begins\nWed...10:00 PM...12...02...22...Daily video highlights reel on NTV\n\n06/21/07\nThu...05:38 AM...12...10...00...Crew wakeup\nThu...07:53 AM...12...12...15...Group B computer powerup\nThu...08:08 AM...12...12...30...IMU alignment\nThu...08:33 AM...12...12...55...Laptop computer stow (part 2)\nThu...08:38 AM...12...13...00...GIRA stow, PGSC stow\nThu...08:53 AM...12...13...15...Deorbit prep timeline begins\nThu...12:50 PM...12...17...12...Deorbit ignition (orbit 202)\nThu...01:41 PM...12...18...03...C-band radar acquisition\nThu...01:55 PM...12...18...17...KSC Landing\n\nShould landing be delayed by the weather or any technical issues, Atlantis has enough fuel, air, water, electrical power and other supplies to remain in orbit until Sunday in a worst-case scenario. Friday and Saturday are available as weather waveoff days while Sunday would be held in reserve in case of technical problems.
