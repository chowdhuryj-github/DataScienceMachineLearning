See RHOME/Tcl/doc.  He'll still have the problem of converting \nTCL/TK documentation conventions into their R equivalents, but I think \nyou've given reasonable documentation on how to do that.\n\nI wish we had a good way to refer to these files from the rest of the \nhelp system.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n\n>> Alberto Monteiro\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
