(destination host  \nunreachable)\n\nI thought the problem might come from the mesh.\nSo I turned down msh0 and ifdow and ifup eth0.\nAfter that the ping works again.\n\nFinally if I restart the mesh on one of the computers, everything is  \nlocked again.\n\nHas any one experienced this behavior before?\n\nThibaut\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
