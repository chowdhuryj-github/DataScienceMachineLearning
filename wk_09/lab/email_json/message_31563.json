Then, when he \nbegan examining some online forms, he became upset. There, in the fine \nprint, he noticed a clause saying he was already signed up for automatic \nsubscription renewal.\n\n\"It's barely noticeable, and, in any event, you aren't given the \nopportunity to decline at this point,\" he told Windows Secrets. All he could see \nwas a link for more information. So, he went to the Symantec Web site to find \nout more.\n\nAccording to Bruce, what ensued was an onerous process of hoop-jumping before he was \nfinally able to tell the company not to renew his subscription and charge his credit card \nautomatically each year.\n\n\"It's really, really an unconscionable scam,\" Bruce adds. \"I'm sure there are \nmany consumers who don't pay attention to their credit card statements, enabling \nSymantec to make quite a profit at about $50 a pop!\"\n\nFor those who feel as Bruce does, the unfortunate truth is that the practice of \nenrolling customers in automatic renewal for antivirus and other security \nproducts is not limited to Symantec. Indeed, it has become an industry standard. \nMicrosoft Windows Live OneCare, Symantec, McAfee, and ZoneAlarm all enroll customers \ninto the companies' automatic subscription-renewal programs with the purchase of a \nsubscription-based product. In most cases, customers aren't given a choice to opt out, \nand only find out about the annual renewals when they receive an e-mail notice or see \na charge on their credit card.\n\nFor some users, automatic renewal is a boon, since it saves the annual chore \nof manually renewing subscriptions to new virus definitions. Others \nview the policy with suspicion, especially since these policies are \noften not made clear at the outset. Moreover, the amount charged for the renewal each \nyear can change, depending on the going rate for the subscription at the time of \nthe renewal.\n\nIn order to get to the bottom of this, I bought products from each of the \nfollowing four security companies to see how transparent the auto-renewal \npolicy is and just how difficult it is to get out of the scheme once you \nknow about it.\n\n\n\nWindows Live OneCare is the least transparent\n\n\n\nOf all the companies I tested, Microsoft's all-in-one security and maintenance \npackage, Windows Live OneCare, has the most-hidden automatic \nsubscription-renewal policy and is the most difficult to learn how to cancel.\n\nYou begin the process by signing up for a free Windows Live account (basically a \nHotmail e-mail account). At the bottom of the form is a link to the \n\nWindows Live Service Agreement, \na 6,708-word document that hints at what's to come. It reads, \"If we \ninformed you that the service will be provided indefinitely or automatically \nrenewed, we may automatically renew your service and charge you for any renewal \nterm.\"\n\nThe actual commitment isn't made until you enter your credit-card information \nand are allowed to review your data before confirming the purchase. \nThe review page shows no information on the subscription-renewal policy \u2014 that is, \nuntil you click View Details under Windows Live OneCare. Only if you open the \nlink do you see this policy statement:\n\n\n\n\"You have selected a one year subscription to Windows Live OneCare ... This is an \nannual subscription that will be automatically charged to your credit card every \nyear at the then current price unless you cancel your account or select an \nalternative plan. You must agree to the Windows Live OneCare Subscription \nAgreement to access the service. Major credit card required. Prices subject to \nchange. Valid in US only.\"\n\n\nDespite the above language, no \"alternative plans\" are listed. Nor is any \ninformation provided on how to get out of the automatic renewal program.\n\nAfter your purchase, you can go to Microsoft's \n Billing and account management page and sign in with your Windows Live \ne-mail and password. There, you can click on the service you purchased (Windows\nLive OneCare) and see links for complete cancellation of the service itself.\nBut nowhere is there information on simply canceling recurring \ncredit-card charges.\n\nIn the end, you have to phone Windows Live OneCare Support at 866-663-2273\nin order to cancel only the automatic-renewal aspect of your subscription. (I\nwas told by a Microsoft representative that this toll-free number also\ncan be called from outside the U.S. if international dialing and the country\ncode 1 is used, but I wasn't able to test this.)\n\n\n\nMcAfee embeds auto-renewal policy in EULA\n\n\n\nA somewhat stealthy approach is taken by McAfee. As part of \nthe online purchase process, users see a scrolling box containing a \n3,280-word end-user license agreement (EULA). Buried in the scrolling text is a \nstatement that reads:\n\n\n\n\"If you have agreed to permit McAfee to automatically renew your subscription to \nthe Software by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to \nMcAfee, your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior \nto the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no \ngreater than McAfee's then-current price, excluding promotional and discount \npricing.\"\n\n\nAccording to the license, simply purchasing with a credit card gives the company \npermission to automatically charge you for a subscription renewal year after \nyear.\n\nHow do you get out of it? The EULA goes on to say:\n\n\n\n\"McAfee may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed \nunless you inform McAfee\u00b4s customer support department at (408) 992-8599 or \n(866) 622-3911 (or any other local number provided by the respective McAfee \nentity in your region) not to renew your subscription to the Software at least \nthirty (30) days prior to the expiration of your subscription to the Software \nand informing them of your desire not to have such subscription automatically \nrenewed.\"\n\n\nGranted, every customer should read the fine print before \npurchase. But, many would argue that this important information about ongoing \ncharges should be made more apparent.\n\nIn case you missed the phone numbers in the EULA, you can always cancel \nauto-renewal of your subscription at the McAfee Web site. However, \nfinding the right page isn't easy, especially since the \nsite's search feature provides no quick answers. Here are the steps for U.S. \ncustomers:\nStep 1: Go to \n\nMcAfee's main U.S. page.\nStep 2: At the right end of the navigation bar near the top, click \nMy Account.\nStep 3: Log in using your e-mail address and password.\nStep 4: In the navigation pane on the left, select Auto-Renewal Setup \nunder My Account.\nStep 5: Under Auto-Renewal Setup, the page should have check boxes \ncorresponding to each product you've purchased. Uncheck the boxes for each \nitem whose subscription you do not want to have renewed automatically. Then \nclick Done.\n\nCustomers outside the United States may need to contact a customer service \nrepresentative either by e-mail, phone, or online chat. These options are \navailable at McAfee's \n main customer service page.\n\n\n\nSymantec: Mandatory auto-renewal, but easier to cancel\n\n\n\nI found that Symantec actually has the second-best policy of the four security \nsites I tested. Symantec products give you no choice, requiring you to accept \nautomatic subscription renewal as part of your purchase, but at least this is \nmade pretty clear from the beginning. An explanation just below the \ncredit-card form in Symantec's online store reads, in part:\n\n\n\n\"By placing this order, you consent to Symantec automatically renewing your annual \nsubscription. Symantec will notify you by e-mail prior to expiration of your \ncurrent subscription ... If you do not want to be automatically charged, you \nmay discontinue the auto-renewal feature of Norton Ongoing Protection at \nany time after completing this order by following the instructions contained on \nthe Symantec Web site and in the confirmation e-mail.\"\n\n\nDespite the lack of choice, Symantec at least warns you, both at the time of \npurchase and in the confirmation e-mail. Moreover, it provides a link to the \n\ncancellation page, both in the \nonline receipt and the confirmation mail.\n\nOn the chance the buyer might miss these statements, I went to \nSymantec's main site to see \nhow hard it would be to find the cancellation page on my own. I entered cancel \nautomatic renewal in the search box at the top of the page. The search returned \nthree results, the first of which was an Enterprise Support Knowledge Base \narticle entitled \"How to cancel On-going Protection.\" The article included a \nlink to the cancellation form.\n\nThe actual cancellation process is a simple matter of filling out the form \nonline and clicking Submit. (This only cancels auto-renewal, not your current \nsubscription.) The only downside is that you'll need to have your name, e-mail \naddress, order number, product activation key, and product serial number to \ncomplete the form! So remember to save your online receipt or the confirmation \ne-mail you received after your purchase.\n\n\n\nZoneAlarm provides a fairly upfront choice\n\n\n\nAs far as security products go, \nCheck Point's ZoneAlarm is the least coercive when it comes to automatic \nsubscription renewal. Unlike the other three companies I tested, the order \nform for ZoneAlarm provides a check box where you enter your credit-card \ninformation that reads \"Automatically renew my subscription upon \nexpiration.\" The box is checked by default, however, so if you miss \nit, you'll be signed up for automatic charges until you cancel. And the \nconfirmation e-mail you receive won't clue you in to this fact.\n\nOnce you're signed up for automatic renewal with a ZoneAlarm product, \ncanceling the auto-renewal isn't too difficult \u2014 providing you know \nwhere on ZoneAlarm's site to look. I had to do a lot of clicking around to \nfind the right page, and the site's search function was little to no help. \nHere's the solution:\nStep 1: On \n\nZoneAlarm's main page, click Customer Support in the navigation pane \non the left.\nStep 2: On the \n Customer Service page, click Login to My Account \nunder Customer Service. You may be \nprompted whether to display both secure and nonsecure items.\nStep 3: On the \n Account Login page, enter the user ID and password you created \nwhen you purchased the product. Click Sign In Now! Again, you \nmay be prompted whether to display both secure and nonsecure items.\nStep 4: On the My Account page, click Manage Subscriptions \nunder the Manage Subscriptions heading.\nStep 5: On the Manage Subscriptions page, look in the section \nwith the Automatic License Renewal heading. Choose Manually renew \nthis license from the Renewal Option drop-down list. Click Submit.\n\n\n\nWhat's behind the hard-to-cancel policies?\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, companies that enroll customers in automatic-renewal programs \nby default tend to describe the policy as an advantage for customers.\n\nA Microsoft spokeswoman explained that \"the goal of implementing the \nautomatic-renewal process was to protect customers from an interruption in their \nservice. Recent studies show as many as two-thirds of antivirus users postpone \ntheir subscription renewal.\" (Microsoft policy prohibits identifying \np.r. spokespeople by name.)\n\nJohn Gable, director of product management for Check Point's ZoneAlarm \ndivision, says the company's recently implemented auto-renewal practice \nwas intended \"to help consumers keep their subscriptions up to date, \nas well as in response to feedback from many users who felt subscription \nrenewal reminders were too intrusive.\"\n\nCorporate altruism doesn't seem to be the only motive in the move to recurring \ncredit-card charges, however. Last year, an article in \n\nTechWeb credited Symantec's then consumer-group chief Enrique Salem as \nsaying that automatic renewal of product updates was one of several \n\"revenue-generating\" strategies to \"pump up the consumer group's \nbottom line.\" (A representative I contacted at Symantec did not \nprovide a comment by press time.)\n\n\n\nConsumer reaction is decidely negative\n\n\n\nDespite the promise of continued service that automatic renewal offers, some \ncustomers clearly don't like being signed up for recurring credit-card billing \nby default. It isn't difficult to find complaints about this practice posted in \nonline forums.\n\nFor example, a user with the screen name RideRed claimed in \n\nBroadbandReports.com that Symantec charged his credit card at renewal time \nwithout his consent, despite the fact that he had turned off automatic renewal \nat the time he made his purchase.\n\nSimilarly, a user of \n Digg.com comments:\n\n\n\n\"I usually don't sign up for services \nthat auto-renew. Why? Because I am surrounded by examples of companies that \nREFUSE to stop charging when the customer tells them to. They call it an 'error' \nand keep right on charging \u2014 all you can do is call and hope they eventually stop \ntaking your money for a service you've long since stopped using.\"\n\n\nQuantifying the level of dissatisfaction is \nmore difficult. None of the companies I was able to reach had (or would reveal) \nthe number of customers who have canceled automatic renewal, although the \nMicrosoft representative did say the majority of customers are auto-renewing \ntheir subscriptions.\n\nNevertheless, it's safe to say most companies track customer \ncomplaints and respond when they reach a critical level. As ZoneAlarm's John \nGable acknowledges, \"We are continuing to run usability testing with regards to \nplacement of the auto-renew option and whether to keep it checked by default or \nnot. Therefore, the way we have it today may very well change based on user \nfeedback.\"\n\n\n\nIf you feel the pain, you must complain\n\n\n\nNo product I reviewed has a completely clean record. ZoneAlarm, to its credit, \nactually does allow users to opt out of automatic renewal before \ncompleting a purchase (but opting out is not the default choice). Symantec, \nfor its part, does make its auto-renewal process apparent and \nrelatively easy to turn off \u2014 compared with the worst cases.\n\nI'm the first to agree that the ability to automatically renew a subscription, \nespecially to an important security service, is a convenience most customers \nshould consider. But to compel customers to adopt automatic charges and then \nhide or obscure that fact is quite another matter. Security \ncompanies compound the problem by making the cancellation process difficult \nand hard to find. In most cases, companies are implementing this policy in every \ncountry where they can lawfully do so.\n\nMicrosoft's spokeswoman told me that the company \"has taken steps to prevent \ntheir customers from being surprised by automatic renewals. Sign-up forms make \nit clear that online customers are entering an automatic-renewal program.\"\n\nBut this is in direct contradiction to my own purchasing experience. It may come as \na surprise to Microsoft that not everyone clicks every link to read the fine print \nduring their online shopping experiences.\n\nAlthough the companies I surveyed send out reminders before the renewal fee is \ncharged, customers can easily lose track of these notices in the deluge of spam \nand business promotions they receive each day.\n\nCorporations seldom change policies that make them rich, unless enough customers \ncomplain. If automatic renewal works for you, then by all means keep the service \ngoing. But, if you don't like the way it's been implemented by your security \nprovider, it's time to let them know.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

Welker writes:\n\n\n\n\"I'm afraid your FUD [fear, uncertainty, and doubt] may be even more dangerous \nthan Microsoft's. There is no basis for trusting a vendor-supplied (or worse, \ndownloaded) binary without code signing. While Microsoft clearly deserves your \nindictment of their shortcomings, your article overlooks the fact that \nthird-party antimalware products can also examine code signatures and prevent \ninstallation and/or execution on that basis.\n\n\"Since it seems unlikely that we're \ngoing to force Microsoft into an open-source model, we have no choice but to \naccept a code-signing model and start signing our code. If there's a real \nAchilles heel in code signing, it would be the allowance of file-based \ncertificates instead of mandatory use of smart cards or similar tamper-resistant \ntokens. Besides, signing open-source code is a good idea \nanyway.\"\n\n\nJust to clarify, it was not and is not my intention to say that driver signing \nis a bad idea, or that it should be abandoned. On the contrary, in light of the \nconstant security and malware threats users face, a multipronged approach to \nsecurity only makes sense.\n\nThe point of the article was that the specific \napproach taken by Microsoft so far in Vista development has not been enough to \nstop serious hackers, while the certification process has created headaches for \nthe legitimate driver developers.\n\n\n\nAnother way to subvert driver signing\n\n\n\nReader Robert Chapin has his own concerns about driver signing:\n\n\n\n\"Scott Dunn didn't mention the most fundamental flaw of the Vista device \ndriver-signing scheme. In fact, because there is no facility for un-signing a driver, \nthis scheme has a history of benefiting malware coders. Once a driver is signed, \nit is considered safe by the OS, even when that driver is obsolete. This \nfundamental problem has been exploited to overwrite drivers with older, published \nversions that are known to have security bugs in them, thus allowing the target \nto be compromised.\n\n\nThere's more on code-signing, our \nMay 3 \nstory on Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and restrictions \u2014 and the \nlack thereof \u2014 on academic editions of software in the \npaid version of today's newsletter. \n\n How to upgrade\n\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.
