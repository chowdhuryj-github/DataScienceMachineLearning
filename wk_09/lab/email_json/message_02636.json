Serial ports just\nwork, since speakup isn't taking them as under linux. The disadvantage\nis that windows is very unstable, to the point of needing to be rebooted\nevery cupple of days.\n\nIf you run vmware under linux and emulate windows, the windows at least\nfor me was sort of slow. Also, sharing between the two operating systems\nwill be an issue - either way. Samba can help with that, or windows file\nsharing on the windows side.\n- - Tyler\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (FreeBSD)\n\niD8DBQFGHPbrTsjaYASMWKQRAkkUAJ9RD5tcLtzuvZWJ1h0ueLaoD+gtaQCePMgZ\nwY43UECWrvrN7gjYI/t4eyE=\n=dnZt\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
