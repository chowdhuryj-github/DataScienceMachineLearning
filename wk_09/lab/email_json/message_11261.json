There will be a loop named for that does the has all\nof the functionality of foreach (just like in Perl 5).  Also the for\nloop will not have the C-style functionality.  A new loop named loop\nwill have that functionality.\n\nSo the Perl 5 code\n\nforeach my $elem (@array) {}\nfor (my $i = 0; $i < 10; $i += 3) {}\n\nwill in Perl 6 become\n\nfor @array -> $elem {}\nloop ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i += 3) {}\n\nNote that the loop construct could also be written like this\n\nfor 0 .. 10 : by 3 -> $i {}\n\nI am not aware of any targeted release date for Perl 6 (other than\n\"when it is done\"), so you still have plenty of time with foreach to\nsay your goodbyes, but I would note that many things from Perl 6 are\ncoming early in perl 5.10: say, given/when, // (like ||, but tests for\nundef, not false), err (like or, but tests for undef not false), and\n~~ (replaces and extends =~).\n\n* http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S04.html\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
