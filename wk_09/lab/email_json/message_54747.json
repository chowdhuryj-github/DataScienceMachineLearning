But\n\n\nIf you need 432MB just to have the data available in R, then you should \nhave *at least* 1GB of RAM in your machine, and for certain function, \nyou might need much more.\n\nHence the advise is to rethink how to reduce the problem or to buy 2GB \nof RAM for your machine (which is advisable in any case, because RAM is \ncheap and thinking hurts). We have upgraded all of our computer labs to \nat least 1GB these days.\n\nUwe Ligges\n\n\n> if I want to get MAplot of my data set, I am getting\n> the messege\n> (\n>> MAplot(ptc.rawData)\n> Error: cannot allocate vector of size 73.8 Mb\n> In addition: Warning messages:\n> 1: Reached total allocation of 503Mb: see\n> help(memory.size) \n> 2: Reached total allocation of 503Mb: see\n> help(memory.size) \n> 3: Reached total allocation of 503Mb: see\n> help(memory.size) \n> 4: Reached total allocation of 503Mb: see\n> help(memory.size))\n> \n> Now how can I get rid of this problem? \n> pls help.\n\n> With thanks\n> \n> Ferdouse\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
