Using these lengths and an offset of 0 should ensure that\nsplice removes all elements of the arrays following the length arguments.\nSo, \"my(@a) = splice(@_,0,shift);\" assigns to @a the values from the first\narray in the call to aeq and \"my(@b) = splice(@_,0,shift);\" assigns to @b the\nvalues from the second array in the call to aeq. Then, the lengths of the two\narrays are compared, and finally, all their elements are compared.\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
