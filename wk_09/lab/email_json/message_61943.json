That if you distribute the Software or any derivative works of the\nSoftware, you will distribute them using a verbatim copy of this\nLicense, and you will not grant any\nrights to the Software or derivative works that are broader than those\nprovided by this Licensing Agreement. For example, you may not\ndistribute any modifications of the Software under terms that would\npermit commercial use, or under terms that require the Software or\nsuch derivative works to be sublicensed to others.\"\n\nYou can't publish a modified version of the work with anything that is\nmixable with the GPL. Unless you published your changes in the form of\npatches only, and even then, only if those patches don't infrnige the\ncopyright in the game at all.\n\nhope this helps,\n\nnic.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
