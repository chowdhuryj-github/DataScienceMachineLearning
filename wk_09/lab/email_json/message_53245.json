Unfortunately I \ndon't think the download was complete.  I got the RPM package.\n\nI'm using Slackware so used\n\nrpm -i --nodeps \n\nThe script asked me for my license key, name and the voice I wanted to \ninstall.  I installed US English. There were no errors after that.\n\nBut when I looked at /opt/IBM/ibmtts, there were no files in the root like \nCOOPYING or readme files.  Also, the source code for ttsynth-say was \nnowhere in the directory nor were there any files in the voicedata/ENG_US.\nAbout all there is in the structure are library files in lib and inc files\nin inc.\n\nSo did I get a partial download or do I misunderstand something.\n\nThe website says not to contact Capital Accessibility so I'm writing you\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nMike Keithley\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
