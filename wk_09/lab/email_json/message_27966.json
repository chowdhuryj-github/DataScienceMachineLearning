Unless I'm\nmissing something, that substitution means the same thing as this\nsimpler one:\n\n    s#(\\d)#$1#g\n\nUnless the value of $1 is useful, it's hard to see what good this\ndoes. It replaces each digit with itself. As side effects it affects\nall the match variables, and it stringifies its target.\n\nDid you find that piece of code somewhere?
