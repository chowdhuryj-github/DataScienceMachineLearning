There were\ninstances of 'INTERP', 'interp' and 'interpreter' within the source\ncode and a TODO item was created (ages ago) to fix this problem and it\nwas decided to standardise everything to 'interp'.  I'm just doing\nsome extra cleanup.  I've not found any problems with build or tests,\nhence why I checked this in.  Is there something I've missed?  Is this\ncausing problems somewhere?\n\nPaul\n\n"}
