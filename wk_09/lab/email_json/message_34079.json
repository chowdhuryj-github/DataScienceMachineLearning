Like the OOXML-ODF translator project announced by\nMicrosoft last year, the new effort will be an open source project hosted\nby SourceForge. The announcement is, in one sense, no surprise. Microsoft\nhas been waging a nation-by-nation battle for the hearts and minds of\nISO/IEC JTC1 National Bodies, in an effort to win adoption of OOXML (now\nEcma 376) as a global standard with equal status to ODF (now ISO 26300).\nIn order to do so, it needs to offset the argument that one document\nformat standard is not only enough, but preferable. With UOF representing\na third entrant in the format race, easy translation of documents would\nobviously be key to lessen the burden on customers of products based upon\none format or the other.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/21/1819214\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php\n    1. http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070521074914744\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Attack-Proof Power Line to be Installed Under NY                   |\n|   from the everyone-is-a-terrorist dept.                           |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 21, @17:01 (Security)      |\n|   http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/21/2029236           |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]Podcaster writes \"American Superconductor Corporation and Con Edison\nhave announced a joint effort to develop and deploy a new system that\nutilizes [1]high temperature superconductor power cable technology in Con\nEdison's grid in New York City.
