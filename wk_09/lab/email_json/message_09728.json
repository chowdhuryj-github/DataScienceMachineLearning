Actually, I am really beginner with R\nand I am sorry for unclear posting while there was chaos in my mind. \n\nNow I will make my question clear. In order to install the package from\nsource, I follows the process from Rtools (http://www.murdoch- \nsutherland.com/Rtools/) and installs all necessary softwares (Rtools, Perl,\nfpTex, the HTML Help Workshop, Inno Setup installer). Althouhg I just want\nto install the RApache package, but I still decide to have them all.\n\nThen I copy the file \"rapache-0.1.4.tar.gz\" to the bin under r-2.4.1 and\ntype command \"Rcmd install rapache-0.1.4.tar.gz\". However, it shows me a\nmessage - \"open(R.INSTALL/rapache-0.1.4/DESCRIPTION): No such file or\ndirectory\". \n\nI have found the description file is under folder of RApache and is\ndifferent from other packages while the file is not under aother folder.\nTherefore, I move it out from the folder of RApache, compress it as .zip,\nand install it through R. Finally, I can find it in my library list but it\ndoes not work. I am wondering if there is any mistake with the process.\nThank you for your helping. \n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Question-for-install-Rapache-package.-tf3582693.html#a10074629\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
