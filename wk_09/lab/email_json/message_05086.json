For example:\n\n  echo '/* begin BSD licensed code */' >> mit.c\n  cat bsd.c                            >> mit.c\n  echo '/* end BSD licensed code */'   >> mit.c\n\nNext I put mit.c and bsd.c into a tarball and send it to you.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nHere is what I think:\n\n  * The portions of mit.c that were not copied\n    from bsd.c remain under the MIT license.\n\n  * The portions of mit.c that were indeed copied\n    from bsd.c remain under the BSD license.\n\n  * bsd.c remains under the BSD license\n\n\nRemarks\n=======\n\nThe BSD is not compatible with the MIT license because it has an\nadditional condition (i.e. you cannot use copyright holder's names\nto promote the product) that the MIT license lacks.\n\nNevertheless, I was able to distribute the tarball in both cases\nbecause I satisfied the distribution conditions of both licenses.\n\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
