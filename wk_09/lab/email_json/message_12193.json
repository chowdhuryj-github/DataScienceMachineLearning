This is why I \nwould like it configurable at boot time so I could just put the settings in \ngrub or module options and the speakup screen reader would automatically \nstart with the settings you want, no later changing them.  If you are \nlistening to a message and fsck is running with the punc_level set to the \ndefault I always get dashes and slashes as it is checking the filesystem. \nIf I could set the level to 0 upon boot then I would not hear these messages \nand I don't really like hearing those anyway.\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Albert E.
