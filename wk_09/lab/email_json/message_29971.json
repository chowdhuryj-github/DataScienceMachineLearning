In the top level \ndirectory there should be a file called INSTALL.  This asks you to read \nthe 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.  The online version is at \nhttp://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html: please search for \n'readline'.\n\n[...]\n\n> configure: error: --with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are not\n> available\n>\n> (3) I issued \"make\" command, then the message I got was:\n> \"make: Fatal error: No arguments to build\"\n>\n> The Unix system that I use is SunOS 5.8.

Try \nsearching the list archives for '--with-readline=yes' if you want to \nconfirm this.\n\nMore generally, Solaris 8 (aka SunOS 5.8) is a rather old OS (our box says \n'October 2001') and did not even come with compilers.  Please read the \nsection on Solaris in the 'Platform Notes' in the manual I cited to make \nsure you have the necessary tools and that they are recent enough.\n(You may need to seek help from your sysadmins on this.)  As well as \nlibreadline, you will need libiconv (unless you use R-patched and \n--without-iconv).\n\n\n-- \nBrian D.
