Another advantage to packages -\nonce built either by myself or from slackware distro, is it is much\neasier to remove all components.

I'm able to try out new Linux distributions on the fly and as I become interested in them.  Today I tried out Slackware 11.0, and I really like it so far.  The only thing I have to get used to is the amount that comes preinstalled and the amount that isn't available.  There are far fewer packages in the Slackware repositories than in, say, the Gentoo Portage system or Debian's package databases.

What is the method for installing stuff that isn't in the Slackware package lists?
