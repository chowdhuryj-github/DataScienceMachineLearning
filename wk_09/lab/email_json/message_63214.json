I don't know how to describe it..\n\nTry this just before you print the variable, to the screen or to the file:\n\n    my $kml_len = length $kml;\n    print \"The kml variable is $kml_len characters long.\\n\";\n\nDoes it give the same answer before you print to the screen as it does\nwhen you print to the file? If it's 12345 bytes one time, it should be\nthe same every time, unless the code generating $kml is doing\nsomething different.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
