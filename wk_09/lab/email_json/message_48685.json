But could one or a few \n      individuals have made off with half a billion dollars?\u00a0As \n      correspondent Steve \n      Kroft\u00a0reports on our lead story, somebody apparently \n      did, making this robbery \u201cthe mother of all heists.\u201d \u00a0The money was \n      supposed to equip the new Iraqi military, instead, say Iraqi \n      investigators, it was stolen by the very people the U.S. government had entrusted to run \n      Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Defense. And \n      they just \u00a0might get away with it. The whole business has become a \n      can of worms, says\u00a0 Kroft: \u201cNeither the United \n      States nor its allies have much of an \n      appetite for pursuing it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWatch Steve Kroft's reporter's \n      notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow wonderful would it be if \n      you could just take a pill to\u00a0take the sting out of bad memories? To \n      the victims of post traumatic stress\u00a0disorder, it would truly be a \n      breakthrough. In fact, correspondent Lesley Stahl\u2019s report on a new \n      use of an old drug suggests there is such a pill that could help \n      millions.\u00a0Our story also looks into the ethical questions \n      involved.\u00a0If\u00a0such a drug were to be put on the market, would it \n      be limited to severe trauma victims, or, as critics say, would the \n      pharmaceutical industry try to profit by encouraging its use for a wide \n      array of situations?\u00a0It would seem the perfect treatment for a rape \n      victim, but what about for a painful breakup or even a bad day at the \n      office?\u00a0 One ethicist tells Stahl\u00a0those kinds of bad memories \n      are integral to who we are: \"They make us better people.\"\n\u00a0\nWatch Lesley Stahl's reporter's \n      notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohn Daly is the bad boy of \n      golf.

But \n      that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Daly\u2019s bad boy habits. \n      Daly tells correspondent Morley Safer, \u201cI was a basket case you \n      know?
