Check\nthe folder settings to see how you have this set.\n\nIn R the list of files is sorted in alpha order and in this case, the\nnumbers are sorted based upon the order of the ASCII values of the\nnumeric characters, not in numeric value order.\n\nYou can try this approach using a regex and sub() to get the numeric\nvalue parts of the file names, get the ordered indices and then pass\nthem back to the vector of file names:\n\n> Files\n[1] \"10files.csv\" \"1abc.csv\"    \"2def.csv\"    \"3ghi.csv\"   \n\n> Files[order(as.numeric(sub(\"([0-9]*).*\", \"\\\\1\", Files)))]\n[1] \"1abc.csv\"    \"2def.csv\"    \"3ghi.csv\"    \"10files.csv\"\n\n\nSee ?sub, ?regex and ?order for more information.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
