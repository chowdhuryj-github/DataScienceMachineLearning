From the article: 'Labour MP Martin Salter, who has worked\nclosely ... in pushing the legislation, rejected the BDSM community's\nclaims their civil liberties were being undermined. He said: \"No-one is\nstopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be\nstrongly advised not to put it on the internet. At the end of the day it\nis all too easy for this stuff to trigger an unbalanced mind.\"' The bill\nfollows from plans [2]initially announced last August.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/05/199233\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6237226.stm\n    1. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/07130.43-46.html#j400\n    2. http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1819228&tid=153\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| The Mainframe Still Lives!                                         |\n|   from the gets-knocked-down-they-get-up-again-etc dept.           |\n|   posted by Zonk on Thursday July 05, @17:52 (IBM)                 |\n|   http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/05/2118203           |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]coondoggie passed us a NetworkWorld blog post about the [1]incredible\nrock-em-sock-em mainframe. Knocked frequently in recent years, the site\nnotes that IBM's workhorse continues to do important work in a number of\nenterprise environments. \"While there are some out there who'd like to\nsee its demise, a true threat to the Big Iron has never really amounted\nto much. Even today, the proponents of commodity boxes offering less\nexpensive x86/x64 or RISC technologies say the mainframe is doomed. But\nthe facts say otherwise. For example, IBM recently said the mainframe has\nachieved three consecutive quarters of growth, marked by new customers\nchoosing the platform for the first time and existing customers adding\nnew workloads, such as Linux and Java applications.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/05/2118203\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://networkworld.com/\n    1. http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/17133\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| MS Moves R&D To Canada Due To Immigration Problem                  |\n|   from the not-enough-brainpower dept.                             |\n|   posted by Zonk on Thursday July 05, @18:40 (Microsoft)           |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/05/2134249              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\ntelso writes \"Microsoft will be [0]opening a new software development\ncenter in Vancouver because of difficulties getting workers into the US.\nThe company said the center will 'allow the company to continue to\nrecruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration\nissues in the US' It seems possible that shrinking immigration quotas\nhave affected America's tax and knowledge base.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/05/2134249\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.cbc.ca/cp/technology/070705/z070502A.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Singles, Not Albums, Define Music Industry Success                 |\n|   from the bite-size-eggs-in-tiny-baskets dept.                    |\n|   posted by CowboyNeal on Thursday July 05, @19:26 (Music)         |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/05/2240252              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]athloi writes \"Despite the tough times for albums, the music industry\nis [1]slowly but surely learning the most important lesson of all: give\nconsumers what they want, and they happily open their wallets. Digital\nmusic sales are a new business and a new way of thinking about and\ninteracting with content. The industry should be paying closer attention\nto its meteoric rise and less attention to the dying, arcane album. It\nshould absolutely drop the rhetoric about how piracy is destroying the\nbusiness, because the sea change in sales patterns shows that something\nelse is is afoot. It means that when users are sitting at a computer and\nlooking for music, more and more each year are turning to legal download\nservices.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/05/2240252\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.dionysius.com/\n    1. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070705-growing-digital-music-singles-killing-the-album.html\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
