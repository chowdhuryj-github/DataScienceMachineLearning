My\ncheckout for the Debian iso was two days ago for\nintegration into a fairly heavily patched 2.6.18 and\neverything did compile after a bit of coercing.  I don't\nhave an express to test though so just wondering if I\nshould remaster with the new CVS.\n\nS\n\n-- \nhttp://www.cm.nu/~shane/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
