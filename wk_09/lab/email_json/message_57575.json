Of course, this \nwould mean checking in a generated file; but perhaps that could be done \nby a robot that sweeps the tree once a day or so.\n\nAn alternative to checking in the MD5 list would be to use a queryable \nserver; but some people work offline or have high-latency links, so \nperhaps that doesn't work so well.\n\n"}
