If you go to the jurisdiction where you are being sued, the end\n  result might be that enforcement is likely.\n* You do nothing, and nothing happens\n\nYou see, if a judge in the U.S. decides that I am guilty as charged\nbased upon evidence brought before him, I couldn't care less. Belgium\ndoes not extradite its own citizens unless those have been convicted by\nBelgian judges and found guilty; so as long as I do not do anything\nwhich might be illegal by Belgian law, there's nothing to stop me from\nnot following the license. Sure, that probably means I should be wary of\ngoing to the U.S. while convicted there, but perhaps I can live with\nthat. And indeed, since extradition isn't for civil cases, they wouldn't\neven ask for extradition in the first place.\n\nOn top of that, the licensor couldn't even sue me in Belgium, since then\n*I* could invoke the choice-of-venue clause to prevent that.\n\nHadn't thought of that before, but I'm starting to like these clauses.\n\n-- \nShaw's Principle:\n\tBuild a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will\n\twant to use it.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
