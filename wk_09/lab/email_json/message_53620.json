Does\nanyone has some tips for me?\n\nThese fields are some times hidden, sometimes visible textfields.\nRight now I am going around like this:\n\nmy $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new();\nmy $self = bless {}, $class;\n$self->{mech} = $mech;\n.........\n$self->{aaa} = 'some text';\n# these fields sometimes are hidden, don't want to set them if they\nare hidden, because that causes error\n$self->{mech}->field( 'aaa' => $self->{aaa}, ) if ($self->{aaa}) && !\ngrep { m'aaa'i } @hidden_fields;\n# list @hidden_fields is populated at runtime\n\nBut if there is a way to set these hidden fields that would be\nhelpful.
