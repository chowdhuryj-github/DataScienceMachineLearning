If you're doing LFS then \"you're on your own\" it is not \nreasonable to expect people to make software \"LFS compatible\".\nBut then if you're into LFS then surely you can make whatever \nminor tweaks necessary to adapt, and that will be half the fun.\nSlack and LFS are two of my fave distros. Less is more :)\n\nGena wrote:\nThe lfs team have a script to unpack debs and rpms.  So that they can \nbe installed on a lfs / blfs system.  Can't remember what it is called.  \nI guess slackware users would need it too, in that case.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n__________ NOD32 2340 (20070620) Information __________\n\nThis message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\nhttp://www.eset.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
