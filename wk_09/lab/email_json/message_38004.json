It didn't solve my problem, but it helped me realize \nthat the formula I was using by hand is invalid for the tie case.  I \njust realized that with R's cor function, the Pearson correlation of the \nranks = the Spearman of the original values.\n\nI've yet to find the formula for the tied case for Spearman, but at \nleast now I know what the problem is (the formula I was using by hand).  \nThanks!\n\nRay\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
