I hope I recall it correctly but there exists a simple \nrelation between the martingale residuals ('mgr') and the unmodified \ncox-snell residuals ('ucs'):\nucs = delta - mgr\nwhere delta refers to your event indicator (0=censored, 1=event).\n\nI don't have the books with me at the moment, but I think I learned \nabout residuals in a survival context either in Klein/Moeschberger: \nSurvival Analysis or in Tableman/Sung Kim: Survival Analysis Using S\n\nI hope this helps,\nRoland\n\n\nMurray Pung wrote:\n> Is there an implementation of the Cox-Snell residuals / Nelson-Aalen plot\n> for goodness of fit?\n> \n> Or otherwise is there an appropriate Goodness of Fit diagnostic?\n> \n> Thanks\n> Murray\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
