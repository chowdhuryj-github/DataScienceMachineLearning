Thats' likely what I am going to do. Anyway, to plot axes, labels of sophisticated graphs on maps may be interesting anyway. For instance, we are monitoring fox and hare populations in tens of game areas. Drawing observations (panel.xyplot) over time and representing the trend variations (panel.loess) at the very place on the map where the observations were done gives an absolutely interesting view where spatial relationships between trends can be visualized.\nPatrick\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
