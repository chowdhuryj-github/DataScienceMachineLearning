Are we talking about the silly name \"associative \narray\" sometimes used form hashes? Or are you trying to say that \nhashes are stored behind the scenes the same way arrays are?\n\nIt's true that you can coerce a hash to a list and you can assign \nthat list to an array, \n\n  @array = %hash;\n\nbut that does NOT mean that a hash is actually an array. It can be \nkinda converted to one, but since the order is unspecified, I don't \nthink it'd make any good when the task at hand is comparing two \nhashes.\n\n\nJenda\n===== Jenda@Krynicky.cz === http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz =====\nWhen it comes to wine, women and song, wizards are allowed \nto get drunk and croon as much as they like.\n\t-- Terry Pratchett in Sourcery\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
