The license for the package\nwould still be the one in the source code, and it would be as well\nthe one in the copyright file.\n\nIn other words, I think it would be ok if our copyright files were worded\nlike this:\n\nThis program is free software. It is under GPL version 2 or later. On Debian\nsystems, the latest GPL version is in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
