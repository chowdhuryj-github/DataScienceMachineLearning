Hi everyone, \n      We'll begin tonight's broadcast with an exclusive report on secret \n      efforts to delay Iran's moves to acquire and develop nuclear technology. \n      Sheila MacVicar will have the story, and David Martin will \n      fill in more details about our country's volatile relationship with Iran. \n      In Iraq, the search for the three U.S. soldiers seized two weeks \n      ago continues. Today, the hunt yielded a body that Iraqi police believe to \n      be one of the missing soldiers. Mark Strassmann reports that the \n      military continues the search while investigators hurry to find more clues \n      and identify the body.

Scientists analyzing \n      photographs of the mother-and-calf pair say their appearance indicates \n      declining health. We'll have more details on these whales and what others \n      of their species to get themselves in situations like this. \n      I hope you'll join us.
