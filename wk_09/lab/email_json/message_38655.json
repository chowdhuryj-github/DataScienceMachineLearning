All that I needed to do \nwas edit the /etc/debootstrap/config file, which was pretty easy with the \ncomments.  Then I ran grml-debootstrap and let it just go.  There were a lot \nof noninteractive messages, which I ignored.  After it was all over,I \nactually didn't need software speech, as I was able to SSH into the system \nfrom another machine.  Now that I've got Etch, though, I'd like full access \nif possible--well, anyway, as full as the lack of a hardware synth will let \nme.\nI hope this helps.  If you've got any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll \ndo the best I can to answer.\nThanks,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Gregory Nowak\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 6:23 PM\nSubject: Re: Successful Debian install...Now what?\n\n\n> Just wondering, how did you end up doing the install?\n> Greg\n>\n>\n> --\n> web site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\n> gpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\n> skype: gregn1\n> (authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n>\n> --\n> Free domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n>\n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Zachary Kline\" \n> To: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \n> \n> Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 5:26 PM\n> Subject: Successful Debian install...Now what?\n>\n>\n>> Hiya,\n>>    I'm not quite sure whether I should worry about rolling my own kernel\n>> as I used to do with Gentoo, or if I can get the Speakup-modified kernels\n>> from somewhere.
