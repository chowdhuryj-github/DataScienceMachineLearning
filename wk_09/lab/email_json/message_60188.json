And the\nadvertising clause is a lot, lot worse than for 4-clause BSD one -- instead\nof just \"advertising materials\" which in free software there usually none,\nGPLv3 forces us to vomit legal crap right in the face of every single user,\neven at a cost to functionality.  While for GUI apps having an \"About\" menu\nitem is usually not an issue, legal notices are a significant burden for\nconsole stuff, both full-screen and line-based.  And just think about\nsoftware which communicates using voice (hands-free things, for example).\n\nCould the FSF be asked for an official statement?  Because if the\ninterpretation you mentioned is what they want, GPLv3 is SCARY.\n\n-- \n1KB\t\t// Microsoft corollary to Hanlon's razor:\n\t\t//\tNever attribute to stupidity what can be\n\t\t//\tadequately explained by malice.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
