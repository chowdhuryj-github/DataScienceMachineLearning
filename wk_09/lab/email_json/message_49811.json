I refuse to carry a\nhardware synth.  I already carry an external keyboard, because I\ndislike laptop keyboards.  Plugging in one or two peripherals is a\npain, if you ask me.  Plus, if you are anything like I am, then there\nwon't be any room in your laptop bag to carry a hardware synth.\nI have never had to ask a sighted person to read Linux boot messages\nfor me, ever.  The only time I ask people to read screens for me is\nwhen I need to use the university's Windows systems (a rarity).\nI usually find a sighted female to help me with this; it gives me a\ngood excuse to listen to a pleasant non-robotic voice.\nIn any case, most of the people at university will not mind helping\nyou with such a small thing.\n\n999 times out of 1000, you'll boot your laptop, speech-dispatcher and\nfriends will start, and all will be well.\n\nJust my two cents,\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
