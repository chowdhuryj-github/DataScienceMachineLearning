I tried to create a table using mysql with the definition of the \ndate/time field given by\n\nCallDate DATETIME,\n\nbut I got an error saying that the first row has\n28/07/2006 0:00\nin that field. What I don't understand is if I open up the .csv file \nusing XEmacs and look at that datum I see\n2006-07-28 00:00:00\nwhich mysql should accept as a DATETIME value.\n\nIf I specify that the field is text with\n\nCallDate CHAR(19),\n\nthen I can create the table without a problem. Then when I issue a query \nand obtain the value of the field in the first row RODBC gives me\n\n28/07/2006 0:00\n\nwhich I guess doesn't surprise me.\n\nCan anybody offer an explanation, and also can anybody advise how to read \nthe field in as a DATETIME type in MySQL?\n\nI have some other date fields too which in XEmacs show as for example\n18/01/2007\n\nMy understanding is I can't read those into a MySQL table as type DATE. \nCan anyone offer some advice on that?\n\nSome details:\nWindows XP, R 2.4.1, RODBC 1.1-9, MySQL 5.0.41\n\nThanks in advance\n\nDavid Scott\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDavid Scott\tDepartment of Statistics, Tamaki Campus\n \t\tThe University of Auckland, PB 92019\n \t\tAuckland 1142,    NEW ZEALAND\nPhone: +64 9 373 7599 ext 86830\t\tFax: +64 9 373 7000\nEmail:\td.scott@auckland.ac.nz\n\nGraduate Officer, Department of Statistics\nDirector of Consulting, Department of Statistics\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
