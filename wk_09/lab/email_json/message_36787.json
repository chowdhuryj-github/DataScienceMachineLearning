I crimped from\nexamples in MASS and the help pages to get most of what I want done.\nHowver, I find both MASS and the help pages are a little too terse for\nmy needs as a beginner. Can anyone suggest web or print resources for\nlattice graphics that provide a more thorough introduction? I've been\nthrough the FAQ and standard manuals, but didn't see what I needed\nthere.\n\nThanks,\n\nTyler\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
