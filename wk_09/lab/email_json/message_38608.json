Something shorter might be nice, but I wasn't proposing a\nrename.  Besides, \"Top\" just reeks of LDAP.  Oh, and you left out\n\"Root\".  It being the root of the type hierarchy and all.\n\n>     Life::Universe::Everything\n\n...which no doubt numifies to 42.\n\nThanks again for answering my silly questions.\n\n-- \nMark J. Reed \n"}
