Thus my reluctance to use them. Emacs may be the way to go, but from what I heard here it has a steep learning curve. The autocompletion feature in 2.5.1 is great. Andy Liaw points me to JGR which I'm just about to jump in.\n\nI was hoping something like the head/tail function with a little more flexibility may also be useful to a lot of folks here.\n\nvw = function( ...., location, nlines=10 ) {\n     #'...' gives the string fragments that identify an object\n     # location : 0.5 = middle, 0.25 = the first quartile, etc....\n     # nlines : the number of lines to show\n}\n\nvw(Auro, 0.5)\n\nreturns the middle part of the first data frame it finds with name string starting with \"Auro\". This function should be easy to write with all thse regular expression functions.\n\nWell, I'll save it for my Christmas wish list.\n\nH.\n\n\n>>> Stephen Tucker  6/12/2007 11:25 PM >>>\nHi Horace,\n\nI have also thought that it may be useful but I don't know of any Object\nExplorer available for R.\n\nHowever, (you may alread know this but) \n(1) you can view your list of objects in R with objects(), \n(2) view objects in a spreadsheet-like table (if they are matrices or data\nframes) with invisible(edit(objectName)) [which isn't easy on the fingers].\nfix(objectName) is also a shorter option but it has the side effect of\npossibly changing your object when you close the viewing data. For instance,\nthis can happen if you mistakenly type something into a cell; it can also\nchange your column classes when you don't - for example:\n\n> options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE)\n> x <- data.frame(letters[1:5],1:5)\n> sapply(x,class)\nletters.1.5.         X1.5 \n    \"factor\"    \"integer\" \n> fix(x) # no user-changes made\n> sapply(x,class)\nletters.1.5.         X1.5 \n    \"factor\"    \"numeric\" \n\n(3) I believe Deepayan Sarkar contributed the tab-completion capability at\nthe command line. So unless you have a lot of objects beginning with\n'AuroraStoch...' you should be able to type a few letters and let the\nauto-completion handle the rest.\n\nBest regards,\n\nST\n\n\n--- Horace Tso  wrote:\n\n> Dear list,\n> \n> First apologize that this is trivial and just betrays my slothfulness at\n> the keyboard.
