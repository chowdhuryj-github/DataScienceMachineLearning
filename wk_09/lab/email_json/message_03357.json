Being personally involved in the matter, what I'm most interested in is the weight of a certain claim in Jeannie Bishop's letter to myself: \"The information stated above is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am authorized to act on behalf of the Science of Identity Foundation, the exclusive owner of the copyright that is being infringed.\" \u00a0 If anyone with some insight into the actual legal mechanisms that might arise here has any thoughts on the matter, I would be very interested in hearing them. To what degree could the \"penalty of perjury\" come into play? What are worst-case-scenario ramifications? etc. Are they just talking shit? Should it be easy to keep this website online? \u00a0 Matt_______________________________________________Discuss mailing listDiscuss@libresociety.orghttp://libresociety.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss_libresociety.org  ----David M.
