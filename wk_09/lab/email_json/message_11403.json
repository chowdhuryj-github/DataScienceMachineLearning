You might want to do an update to R to\nget the most recent Hmisc. \n\nAn alternative in Hmisc that Frank Harrell pointed out\nis to do a SAS export file and a special version of\nthe format file.  \n\nIt is described in the Hmisc reference manual See\nsasxport.get . It worked just fine for me on a couple\nof test files. I don't remember but I think you're\nstuck with the 8 character variable names though.\n\n\n--- Daniel Nordlund  wrote:\n\n> > -----Original Message-----\n> > From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch]\n> > On Behalf Of a.martino@crismaitalia.it\n> > Sent: Friday, April 20, 2007 6:36 AM\n> > To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> > Subject: [R] importing sas datasets\n> > \n> > Hello,\n> > \n> > I wanted to ask help about importing sas datasets.\n> > \n> > 1)I tried with some functions as read.ssd (foreign\n> package),\n> > but it doesn't import the file if the length of\n> the\n> > variables' names are longer than 8 bite (it has to\n> conform\n> > to the 6 version).\n> > \n> > 2)I then tried with the sas.get function (Hmisc\n> package) but\n> > with the command:\n> > \n> >  c<- sas.get(lib=\"c:\\\\ghan\", mem=\"mkds0001\",\n> var=(\"   \"),\n> > format.library=\"d:\\\\R\\\\R-2.4.1\",\n> > sasprog=\"C:\\\\Programmi\\\\SAS\\\\SAS 9.1\\\\sas.exe\")\n> > \n> > R can't launch the sas.exe because there is a\n> space in the\n> > directory SAS 9.1.\n> > \n> <<>>\n> \n> Anna,\n> \n> There has been a thread on this problem recently. \n> You could check the archives for posts with the\n> subject \"sas.get problem\".
