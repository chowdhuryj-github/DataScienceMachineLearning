If this is doable, and will provide speech\nsignificantly earlier in the boot process, (especially if I were to\nbuild alsa into the kernel itself), then could someone familiar with\nhow to work with initrds please describe the steps I would need to\ntake in order to accomplish this on a debian system? Thanks in\nadvance.\n\nGreg\n\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGjeQX7s9z/XlyUyARAtZJAJsEs5IuKsVNNL1tODFuILRKiiljIwCg20ih\nCnptvy/Qt0IqIUggn6103Cw=\n=q68h\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
