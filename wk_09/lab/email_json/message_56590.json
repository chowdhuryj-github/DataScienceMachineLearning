Officers have never \n            previously cracked down on the use of marijuana in the kitchen or \n            said the practice was a particular problem.\nKalla and the police chief both reiterated their support for the \n            death penalty for drug traffickers, noting that neighboring Malaysia \n            and Singapore also execute \n            offenders.2007-06-27T04:15:03Z \n  \n"}
