I can't say I agree with recent comments stating \nwho worries about security on home machines. Home machines are \nthe primary target for hackers so they can be taken over and made \ninto zombies sending spam and other nasty things. A single infected\nPC can send a million spam per day or more. People actually sell \naccess to compromised machines. Botnets have been created that \ncontrol tens of thousands of machines at once. The FBI recently\npassed a one million mark in recording number of zombie victims.\nGranted most of these are windows machines, but linux is popular\nenough to become a target also. Do worry about security on home\nmachines. If you are controlling both of those machines, I would \nrecommend not opening ports at all until you need them then \nclosing them when you're done.\n\n   -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
