However, I really need to\nknow is that if i have values: 0.1 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, for example, how I\ncan plot these using colours that would be different if the contents of the\nfile were 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0. Using color.scale scales them so that\nthey differ, but only relative to each other, rather than taking the actual\nvalue and converting them to some unique colour/colour intensity.\n\nMany thanks\n\n\n\nJim Lemon-2 wrote:\n> \n> mister_bluesman wrote:\n>> Hello.\n>> \n>> I have a 2d plot which looks like this:\n>> \n>> http://www.nabble.com/file/8242/1.JPG \n>> \n>> This plot is derived from a file that holds statistics about each point\n>> on\n>> the plot and looks like this:\n>> \n>>           a            b            c           d          e\n>> a        0            0.498    0.473    0.524   0.528\t\t\t\t\n>> b       0.498      0           0           0          0\n>> c       0.473      0           0           0          0\n>> d       0.524      0           0           0          0\n>> e       0.528      0           0           0          0\n>> \n>> However, I have another file called 2.txt, with the following contents:\n>> \n>> a      b      c      d      e   \n>> 0.5   0.7  0.32 0.34 0.01\n>> \n>> What I would like to know is how do I convert these values in 2.txt to\n>> colours or colour intensities so that the x's in the diagram above can be\n>> colour coded as such.\n> \n> Yo bluesman,\n> \n> check color.scale in the plotrix package, cat\n> it'll color your points to the values they're at\n> \n> Jim\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n> \n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Representing-a-statistic-as-a-colour-on-a-2d-plot-tf3703885.html#a10404970\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
