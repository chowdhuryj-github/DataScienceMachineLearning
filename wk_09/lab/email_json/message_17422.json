I want \nto sort it by non-directories first and then directories, with a \nsecondary sort in alphabetical order.\n\nI currently have:\n\n--------------------------------\nmy @items = sort {\n\t\n\tmy $a_path = $args->{directory_from} . '\\\\' . $a;\n\tmy $b_path = $args->{directory_from} . '\\\\' . $b;\n\t\n\t( -d $a_path ) ? 1 : 0;\n\t\n} readdir $directory;\n--------------------------------\n\nwhich gets me the non-directories first and directories after but not in \nalphabetical order.\n\nI don't want to rely on the alphabetical ordering from the readdir as I \nbelieve that Perl's sort does not guarantee to maintain ordering in \nfuture releases?\n\nCan't get my head round this, please help! :)\n\nCheers,\nNigel\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
