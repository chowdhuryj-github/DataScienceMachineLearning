Is there any other email list or\nforum for that? For example, I have a question regarding variance. It is\ndefined as:\nvariance = sum(sq(Xi-mean)) / (N-1)\nand I never understood why not define it as\nvariance = sum(absolute(Xi-mean) / (N-1)\n\nI read somewhere that this cannot be differentiated on 0. But, why is it\nnecessary to be able to differentiate it?\n\nThanks.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
