I much prefer the mixed-effects form.\n\nThanks for your response. I was too vague, sorry. I think I want to fit a gls \nmodel at the lowest level and a mixed effects model with random effects for \nintercept and slope the the highest level.\nI dont know if I express that right:\nwould know how to do using GLS: V=R, R is a \"double\"block diagonal matrix\nwould also know how to do w/LME: V=WHW'+ZGZ'+R, R is diagonal\nwanted: V=WHW'+R, R is block diagonal.\n\nThis is just for my learning purposes to replicate a textbookexample. This \nexample has 3 levels. The lowest are 2, possibly more, multivatiate measurements \n(not longitudinal, just to measures, math score and language score in the \nexample, ie unstructured covariance matrix). These are nested within individuals \nand the individuals are nested within schools. For the lowest level I would \nchoose a gls model for the higher level I would want a lme model both at the \nsame time.\n\nThanks for your thought.\n\nToby\n\n> \n> \n> \n>>Thanks for your help.\n>>\n>>Toby\n>>\n>>\n>>dtaa =\n>>read.table(\"http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mplus/examples/ma_snijders/mlbook1.dat\",\n>>sep=\",\")\n>>dta1 = reshape(dtaa, list(c(\"V10\",\"V12\")), \"score\", direction=\"long\",\n>>drop=c(\"V2\",\"V3\",\"V4\",\"V5\",\"V6\",\"V7\",\"V8\",\"V9\",\"V11\",\"V13\",\"V14\",\"V15\",\"V16\",\"V17\",\"V18\",\"V19\",\"V20\",\"V21\",\"V22\",\"V23\",\"V24\",\"V25\"))\n>>colnames(dta1)[1] = \"schoolNR\"\n>>dta2 = dta1[order(dta1$id),]\n>>head(dta2)\n>>timef = factor(dta2$time)\n>>\n>>summary(mdl1l <- lme(score~timef-1, dta2, ~timef-1|schoolNR/id,,,,\"ML\"))\n>>summary(mdl1g <- gls(score~timef-1, dta2, corCompSymm(, ~timef|schoolNR/id),\n>>varIdent(, ~1|id*timef),,\"ML\"))\n>>\n>>______________________________________________\n>>R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>>https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>>PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>>and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>\n> \n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
