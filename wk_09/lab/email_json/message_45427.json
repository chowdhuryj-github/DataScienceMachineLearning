The synth is incredibly responsive, even on a \ndual celeron 466Mhz box. One thing I have noticed however, is that \nspeech does not shut up very quickly when one presses a key, or the \ncontrol key. Speech also overlaps when quickly skimming over text, \neither by line, word, or character. I'd say this has something to do \nwith ALSA being used, but is probably not too hard to work around in the \ncode. The utility also randomly crashes sometimes, and I hope to see if \nI can debug that.\n\nJanina, what is the speakup connector source code license?\n\nI can make Ubuntu/Debian packages if people are interested.\n- -- \nLuke Yelavich\nGPG key: 0xD06320CE \n\t (http://www.themuso.com/themuso-gpg-key.txt)\nEmail & MSN: themuso@themuso.com\nJabber: themuso@jabber.org.au\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGap4VjVefwtBjIM4RAnYWAKDFNu5knHIh2SCqLaUAccdhrox6hQCg57Se\nttRBKDXvpRwEo634yojd32Q=\n=HlC9\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
