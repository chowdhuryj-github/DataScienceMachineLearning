That track is licensed under BY-NC (I know I know) so the highest bidder has the right to redistribute the track non-commercially. In this case non-commercial seems to forbid resale, one of the most common interpretations of the license provision, but also \"commercial exploitations\" which may or may not prohibit the highest bidder from posting it on an adwords blog.\nAnyway, I think its a particularly neat way to co-opt eBay and digital distribution to handle part of the job of a record company. Now we just have to wait and see how much the auction goes for (it starts on June 1st.)\nFredOn 5/20/07, Kevin Phillips (home) <tacet@qmpublishing.com> wrote:\n----- Original Message -----From: \"drew Roberts\" <zotz@100jamz.com>To: <cc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\n>Sent: Sunday, May 20, 2007 1:28 AMSubject: Re: [cc-community] Strayform - where artists and fans connecttofundand distribute new creative works[snip]> >> > I've looked into several possibilities here in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0There's a number\nof> > projects which gain government funding for \"charitable work\", or\"community> > work\" which benefits others at reduced or no cost.\u00a0\u00a0We have a community> > studio locally for instance, I could record stuff there cheaply, or\n> > continue to do as I do now and record stuff in my own home setup.\u00a0\u00a0I'mnot> > sure if a band could run as a registered charity, though it's an> > interesting concept ;)>\n> That is an idea.
