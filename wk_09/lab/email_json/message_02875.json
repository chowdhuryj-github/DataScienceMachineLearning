Weekly: April 11", "body": "\n\nTrade Talk Weekly Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 11, 2007\n\u201cThe Big Picture\u201d\nIt was a wacky, crazy day for Trending123 folks.\u00a0  At least it seemed that way to me after spending time in our trading room.\u00a0  I\u2019m in there all the time and one of the things I like most about hanging out with my subscribers each day, is being able to get an instant, accurate temperature on market participants and what they are feeling.\nToday the overriding sentiment is screaming: I\u2019m anxious and a little crazed.\u00a0  Hmm, who does that remind me of?\u00a0  Oh, yes, our volatile markets!\u00a0  I really believe that the markets are neurotic and so are we.\n\nSince you aren\u2019t a Trending123 subscriber (though I hope you will become one someday soon), you don\u2019t know about my Buy Alerts.\u00a0  I send out A LOT of \u2018em.\u00a0  Well, it\u2019s funny to me because it seems that when I recommend a stock that dips, everyone is paying attention and gets right in on the stock.\u00a0  But when I send out an alert on a stock that moves right up, everyone gets a little freaked out and acts like they never received that email.\nMeet the RST\nRight now, because of this highly volatile market we are in, there are a bunch of stocks that are trading in a familiar pattern known as the RST.\u00a0  It stands for Reverse Symmetrical Triangle.\u00a0  You can learn more about it here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams Percent Range\nThe Williams Percent Range, usually abbreviated \u201cWilliams %R,\u201d is one of the top three indicators we use at Trending123 to identify trend reversals.\u00a0  It\u2019s named after its developer, Larry Williams.\u00a0  Williams used a scale of 0% to 100% to show the relationship of the current closing price relative to the range of prices from the highest to the lowest over a certain period of time.\u00a0  As the closing price approaches the high, the Williams %R will approach 0%.\u00a0  And as the closing price approaches the low, the Williams %R will approach 100%.\nThe Williams %R gives us an easy-to-read signal for when the trend might be turning bullish or bearish.\u00a0  If the Williams %R rises above the 50% line, it\u2019s bullish.\u00a0  If it falls below the 50% line, it\u2019s bearish.\u00a0  Even better, when you use the Williams %R in conjunction with two other top Trending123 indicators\u2014the Aroon and the PPO\u2014you\u2019ve got three tools that together allow you to identify what I call 1-2-3 bullish and bearish trend reversals.\u00a0  And as Trending123 subscribers have seen again and again, that\u2019s where the best profits are.\n\n\n\n\nAnd for some reason, when a stock is stuck in this pattern, people become a little edgy!\u00a0  It\u2019s psychologically so mind-boggling that people seem to go a little nuts as they follow it.\u00a0  The pattern is jumpy, no doubt about it.\u00a0  And that\u2019s why if you own EOG or HMY for example and you are following the charts, you probably hate both of these stocks.\u00a0  My Trending123 subscribers certainly do.\u00a0  But not because the stocks don\u2019t continue to be potential money-makers for them \u2014 they definitely are still holding steady in the Trending123 portfolio.\nSo then why the hatred for these stocks?\nBecause the buying pressure in this market is causing stocks to enter this RST pattern\u2014the pattern that makes you feel like you are trapped in a Fun House and you\u2019re not sure what is going on!\u00a0  It\u2019s intense.\u00a0  It\u2019s volatile.\u00a0  It will make you feel like pulling your hair out because you will feel out of control.\nOne of my subscribers recently asked me why it seems like the market will open up in one direction and then gyrate to another and then gyrate back to the original location again?\u00a0  Plain and simple: it\u2019s because everyone is reacting.\u00a0  And as I have mentioned before and will continue to reiterate until everyone knows it like they know their name\u2014you must not react to the market.\u00a0  You want to be an ACTor not a REACTor.\nLike do you notice how volume comes in when a stock goes up and volume comes in when a stock goes down?\u00a0  Everybody is reacting to what has already happened.\u00a0  And that\u2019s why it is so easy for the market participants\u2014the people with the most money\u2014to fleece the people with the least amount of money.\u00a0  Nobody likes stocks where they should like them.\u00a0  They like them at current levels.\u00a0  They like them when everything seems rosy and picture-perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStuck in the Volatility Vortex?\nIt sure as heck feels like we are getting tossed around in the market these days!\u00a0  Some people are starting to get a little nervous\u2014for good reason!\nThe Dow drops 400 points one day.\u00a0  It jumps 200 points another day.\u00a0  Then it falls 150 points again.\u00a0  Then up 45 once more.\u00a0  Back and forth, back and forth.\nSo how are my Trending123 subscribers are taking it all in stride?\u00a0  How can they concentrate on the opportunities that await them rather than focusing on the stress?\nI\u2019ll tell you the secret: the charts are telling us to expect a stealth bull market in the weeks ahead.\u00a0  And the charts don\u2019t lie.\nI\u2019d love to see you get your share of the profits.\u00a0  Click here to view a free seminar that will show you a few of the profit opportunities that lay ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to force your mind out of this type of thinking.\u00a0  You need to open up your eyes wide and see the big picture.\u00a0  Where is the stock headed further down the line?\nPeople that can overcome the everyday thought process (focusing just on what is directly in front of them) and instead look around and over it\u2026those are the people that will end up making the most money in the long run.\nAnd of course I want YOU to be one of these people.\u00a0  A true participant in the market who is in control and leading the charge to their own financial destiny.\u00a0  And I\u2019m here to help you make get there.\u00a0  You can swing by my site anytime you
