I have suceeded with nlm and optim-method CG. I have been told that I should get also with other optim methods. Actually, I found the same results when testing a very straightforward equation. However with a more complicated model it was not true. It is realy possible? Have I got it by chance in the simple case?\n\nSecondly, in order to check which optimization is more suitable for our study, I would like to have the value of the minimized parameters on each iteration to later plot a \"likelihood surface\". However, for both nlm and optim, I could only keep the last iteration results. Is there a way to store/record the minimized values for each iteration? \n\nSorry if these questions are reocuring. I have been searching for hints but did not get too far and I am fairly new to R.\n\nComments and examples are most  welcome.\nSilvia Hadeler\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
