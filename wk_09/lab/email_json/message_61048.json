My data look like this:\n\n#Total sequences: 23873\n0\t19936\n1\t218\n2\t391\n3\t477\n4\t360\n5\t431\n6\t294\n7\t215\n8\t320\n9\t209\n10\t160\n (.....)\n99\t0\n100\t1\n101\t0\n102\t0\n103\t1\n104\t0\n105\t0\n106\t0\n107\t0\n108\t0\n109\t1\n\n\nTherefore, I would like to show the column representing 0 (with 19936\nsequences) \"cut\" so it doesn't dominate the rest of the plot. Also,\nstarting from about 10 sequences, I would like to group the rest of the\nsequences into groups of 5 each (for instance, 10-15, 16-20, 21-25 etc).\n\nI have looked extensively in the help pages and in some online fora, but\nhave not found an answer to this question. I would greatly appreciate any\ntips. Thanks, Peter\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
