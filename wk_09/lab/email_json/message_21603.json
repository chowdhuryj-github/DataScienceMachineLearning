This was a relief, but I still don't know whether the distance matrix\nis what it should be.  I tried 'str(dist.PxMx)', which is the name of my\ndistance matrix, but I get something that has not much meaning to me, an\nunexperienced R user:\n\nClass 'dist'  atomic [1:55945] 329.6 194.9 130.1  70.7 116.9 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"Size\")= int 335\n  ..- attr(*, \"Labels\")= chr [1:335] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"Diag\")= logi FALSE\n  ..- attr(*, \"Upper\")= logi FALSE\n  ..- attr(*, \"method\")= chr \"euclidean\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"call\")= language dist(x = PeaksMatrix, method = \"euclidean\",\ndiag = FALSE, upper = FALSE,      p = 2)\n\nAny more suggestions, please?\n\n\n\nSilvia Lomascolo wrote:\n> \n> I work with Windows and use R version 2.4.1.
