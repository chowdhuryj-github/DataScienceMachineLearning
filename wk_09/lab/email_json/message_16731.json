I'm currently using the \"lenny\" or testing version.  I'm trying \nto set up a Linksys wireless card or stick.  When I boot the computer \nthe BIOS sees the stick on the USB port, but there's nothing to tell it \nto configure it as a network device.\n\nThe output of lsusb is:\n\nBus 001 Device 002:  ID 13b1:0020 Linksys\nBus 001 Device 001:  ID 0000:0000\n\nMy kernel is 2.6.17.  I've downloaded the \"wireless-tools\" package.  Any \nadvise would be appreciated.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
