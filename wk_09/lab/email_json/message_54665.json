I\nhave a time series of natural gas prices by flow date. Since gas is not\ntraded on weekends and holidays, I have a lot of missing values,\n\nFDate\tPrice\n11/1/2006\t6.28\n11/2/2006\t6.58\n11/3/2006\t6.586\n11/4/2006\t6.716\n11/5/2006\tNA\n11/6/2006\tNA\n11/7/2006\t6.262\n11/8/2006\t6.27\n11/9/2006\t6.696\n11/10/2006\t6.729\n11/11/2006\t6.487\n11/12/2006\tNA\n11/13/2006\tNA\n11/14/2006\t6.725\n11/15/2006\t6.844\n11/16/2006\t6.907\n \nWhat I would like to do is to fill the NAs with the price from the\nprevious date * gas used during holidays is purchased from the week\nbefore. Though real simple, I wonder if there is a function to perform\nthis task. Some of the imputation functions I'm aware of (eg. impute,\ntranscan in Hmisc) seem to deal with completely different problems. \n\n2.5.0/Windows XP\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHT\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
