When I run perl MakeFile, I get the following. \n\n=====================\nUsing Oracle in /export/home/netcool/oracle\nDEFINE _SQLPLUS_RELEASE = \"1002000300\" (CHAR)\nOracle version 10.2.0.3 (10.2)\n        Unable to locate an oracle.mk, proc.mk or other suitable *.mk\n        file in your Oracle installation.  (I looked in\n        /export/home/netcool/oracle/rdbms/demo/demo_xe.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/rdbms/lib/oracle.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/rdbms/demo/oracle.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/rdbms/demo/demo_rdbms.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/precomp/demo/proc/proc.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/precomp/demo/proc/demo_proc.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/proc/lib/proc.mk /export/home/netcool/oracle/proc16/lib/proc16.mk under /export/home/netcool/oracle)\n        The oracle.mk (or demo_rdbms.mk) file is part of the Oracle\n        RDBMS product. The proc.mk (or demo_proc.mk) file is part of\n        the Oracle Pro*C product.  You need to build DBD::Oracle on a\n        system which has one of these Oracle components installed.\n        (Other *.mk files such as the env_*.mk files will not work.)\n        Alternatively you can use Oracle Instant Client.\n        In the unlikely event that a suitable *.mk file is installed\n        somewhere non-standard you can specify where it is using the -m option:\n                perl Makefile.PL -m /path/to/your.mk\n        See README.clients.txt for more information and some alternatives.\n     at Makefile.PL line 1072.\n==============================\nThe instant client does not have the .mk files this output talks about. I am able to run sqlplus that is in the instant client and connect to database.\n\nCould someone help.\nThanks\nRavi\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nMoody friends.
