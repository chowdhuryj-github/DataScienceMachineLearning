As of this writing, the test was still underway but NASA officials said it appeared the system was functioning smoothly, a requirement before the shuttle Atlantis undocks on Tuesday.\n\nThe test began after the shuttle's rocket thrusters were used to re-orient the station for a shuttle waste water dump. When the excess water had been dumped overboard, flight controllers maneuvered the station back to its original orientation, or \"attitude,\" and switched control over to the revived Russian guidance, navigation and control computers. The computers then commanded Russian thrusters to maintain the proper attitude for about an hour.\n\nControl of the Russian thruster system then was switched to U.S. computers and again, the hardware and software worked together as required during the latter stages of the test to keep the station stable and pointed in the right direction. The results of the checkout operation will be reviewed by NASA's Mission Management Team later today. Barring additional problems, the Atlantis astronauts are expected to be cleared to seal hatches between the spacecraft this evening to set the stage for undocking on Tuesday.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
