I nearly have Rserve working....\n\nI have the dialog box which says..\n\nRserve: Ok, read to answer queries.\n\nHaving read all i can find, I followed the guidance given on\nhttp://rosuda.org/Rserve/example.shtml \n\nI tried to follow the first example but I am getting an error descirbed\nbelow. My IDE looks like this:\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/file/p10705244/ide.jpg \n\nHowever, when I try and compile my java file I get the following error:\n\nCannot access Rconnection\nbad class file: C:\\org\\rosuda\\JRclient\\Rconnection.class\nclass file contains wrong class: org.rosuda.JRclient.Rconnection\nPlease remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the\nclasspath.\n        Rconnection c = new Rconnection();\n        ^\n\nI am not quite sure I am doing wrong here... Could someone look at my IDE\ntree hierarchy and give me some guidance?\n\nMany Thanks\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Problems-accessing-Rconnect-tf3785535.html#a10705244\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
