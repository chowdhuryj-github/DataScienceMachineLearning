These appear difficult to get since\n   there   are   an   infinte  number  of  values  for  the  distribution\n   parameters.   To  run this test on many models (e.g., say each traffic\n   light  at  an  intersection in a city for 1 minute at the start or the\n   common lunch hour of 11:30 AM each day), takes too long to simulate to\n   get the critical values.  Looking for appoximations so that when I the\n   mle  estimates  of  the  distribution parameters for Gamma, I can then\n   do a  quick  Goodness  of  fit test to see if the data distribution is\n   Gamma.   I have quick search tables or approximating equations for the\n   other  common  distbutions  (Exp,  Norm,  Weibull,  ect.), but not the\n   Gamma.\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   [1]Need a break?
