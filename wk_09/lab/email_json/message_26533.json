Cynthia Bowers will \n      report from Missouri, where riverside towns are under several feet of \n      water after at least 20 levees were overtopped, resulting in the worst \n      flooding in more than a decade. The deluge that caused the \n      flooding is a remnant of the storm system that leveled the town of \n      Greensburg, Kansas. President Bush toured the destruction in Greensburg \n      today and Hari Sreenivasan will have that story. On the \n      West Coast, a wildfire is threatening Los Angeles landmarks, including a \n      park's famed conservatory and zoo. Sandra Hughes will have that \n      report. And Bianca Solorzano is on the other side of the country \n      reporting on the massive fires that are working their way through southern \n      Georgia to the northern border of Florida. Meanwhile, Vice \n      President Dick Cheney is in Baghdad, on a surprise stop to urge Iraq's \n      warring factions to find more common ground. Mark Strassmann is \n      there and will have our report. What's the newest popular export \n      from China? Its language. American students are learning Mandarin in \n      droves, and it's becoming a popular subject in schools from Maryland to \n      Washington state. Barry Petersen will report on the programs and \n      their wide appeal in America. Finally, we\u2019re going to introduce \n      you to a poet whose services reach an unusual market \u2013 the supermarket. \n      Zach Houston hawks his wares, commissioned poems, outside of grocery \n      stores in Berkeley, California. He may not be a Wordsworth, but what comes \n      out of this wordsmith\u2019s typewriter just might surprise you. John \n      Blackstone will have the story.
