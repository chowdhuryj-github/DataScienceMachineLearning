The\nfeature list includes:\n\n* creation of relations by domain and graph/characteristic\nfunction/incidences,\n\n* extraction of characteristic function and graph,\n\n* predicate functions for the most common standard characteristics,\n\n* operators known from relational algebra theory (such as projection,\nselection, cartesian product, joins, etc.),\n\n* transitive/reflexive reduction and closure of a relation,\n\n* relation ensembles for combining relations,\n\n* fitters for determining (possibly all) consensus relations of a\nrelation ensemble including the Borda and Condorcet methods, as well as\nexact solvers for minimizing a criterion function based on the symmetric\ndifference (Kemeny-Snell) metric.\n\n* a simple plot method for Hasse-diagrams using RGraphviz.\n\n\nKurt and David\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
