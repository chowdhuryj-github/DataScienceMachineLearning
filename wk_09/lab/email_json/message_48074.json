Instead \"kill($sig, $pid)\" terminates the pro\u001b$B!>\u001b(B\n               cess identified by $pid, and makes it exit immediately with\n               exit status $sig.  As in Unix, if $sig is 0 and the specified\n               process exists, it returns true without actually terminating\n               it.
