Luckily, there are still some Internet drugstores that we can rely on.\n\"High price proves the high quality of the drug\" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.\nCanadianPharmacy the only Canadian Web pharmacy to be recommended by FDA.\nYours,Pearlie Christiansen\n\n\n\n\n"}
