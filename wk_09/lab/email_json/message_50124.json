For example, consider \ntest t/src_hash_6.  If I compile and run it manually, I get\n\n    $ t/src/hash_6                 \n    42\n    Segmentation Fault(coredump)\n\nBut if I run it via the test harness, I get\n\n    $ perl5.8 -Ilib t/src/hash.t\n    1..11\n    ok 1 - parrot_new_hash\n    ok 2 - parrot_hash_put\n    ok 3 - parrot_hash_get\n    ok 4 - parrot_hash_get with NULL key\n    ok 5 - parrot_hash_get with empty string key\n    ok 6 - parrot_hash_get with big key\n    ok 7 - parrot_hash_size\n    ok 8 - parrot_hash_delete\n    ok 9 - parrot_hash_clone\n    ok 10 - hash iteration\n    ok 11 - hash iteration on empty hash\n\nI think the exit code stuff has been changed (this test used to get\nreported as failing) but the $builder->diag weirdness is unchanged.\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
