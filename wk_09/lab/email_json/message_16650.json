Today my eyes are full of tears and my soul is ill. Today I have understood how alone I am.\nWoman...There are so many qualities consist in this word! What the real woman has to be? I think she has to be loving, affectionate, tender, careful, sensible. The woman can't be the real woman without these qualities. I can tell that I am the woman, the real woman.\nBut I have nobody to present my love, affectionate and tenderness. I have nobody to take care of. I have nobody to be sensible with.\nI can't realize myself like the woman without you. Only you can help me to become the real woman!\nI will wait http://myhearthwithlove.com/likes\n\n\nLooking forward to hear from you\n\nYulechka\n\n\n"}
