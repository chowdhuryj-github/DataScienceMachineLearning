This approach is given\nin the reference below.  The difference between multivariate repeated\nmeasures and general MANOVA is that the former imposes a model matrix\n(contrasts) on the measures to reflect the repeated measures design.\nGeneral MANOVA does not have this extra matrix.  The Hotelling T-squared\napproach with a measures model matrix would be equivalent to\nmultivariate repeated measures.\n\nIn your case, you need to specify the measure model matrix for the 4\ntime points (polynomial, differences, Helmert), which usually cannot be\ndone in a standard T-square program.  However, you could compute the\nmodel matrix results (contrasts) beforehand and submit them to the\nT-square program.  Your taking the difference scores on the 1st factor\nis doing just that.\n\nJoe\n\n@BOOK{Bock1975,\n  author = {Bock, R.

What exactly is the difference between doing a\ntwo-factor repeated measures ANOVA and a Hotelling T-squared test for a\npaired comparison of mean vectors?\n\nGiven:\n\nAnova: repeated measures on both factors, 1st factor = two different\ntreatments, 2nd factor = 4 time points, where you are measuring the\nblood pressure at each of the time points.\n\nHotelling T^2: You look at the difference in the 4x1 vector of blood\npressure measurements for the two different treatments, where the four\nrows in the vector are the four time points.\n\n\nI am mainly interested in the main effects of the two treatments.  Can\nsomeone please explain if there would be a difference in the two methods\nor any advantage in using one over the other?\n\nThanks,\nSean\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
