This is not what pipes are for.\nPIpes (at least unnamed pipes) take the place of the STDIN or STDOUT\nfor a given program.  I don't believe MS Windows Notepad does anything\nsignificant with its STDIN.  Pipes are generally not as useful on a\nMicrosoft platform since most of the utilities are GUI based and are\nnot setup for automation the same way UNIX style utilities are;\nhowever, you should look into the Win32::* modules.  In particular I\nthink Win32::CtrlGUI* and Win32::OLE should help*.\n\n* http://search.cpan.org/search?m=all&q=win32&s=131\n* http://search.cpan.org/~teverett/Win32-CtrlGUI-0.30/Win32/CtrlGUI.pm\n* http://search.cpan.org/~jdb/libwin32-0.27/OLE/lib/Win32/OLE.pm\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
