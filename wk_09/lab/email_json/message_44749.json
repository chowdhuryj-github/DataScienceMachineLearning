It is very useful to get icc for many\nreasons and it is easy to do so from linear mixed-effects models and many\npackages like psy, psychometric, aod and irr have functions to calculate icc. \n\nicc = between-group variance/(between-group variance + residual variance) \n\n*residual variance = within-group variance \n\nHowever, I have yet to find a convincing reference or some sort on how to\ncalculate icc from GLMM. I have found below:\n\nicc = between-group variance/(between-group variance + 1)\n*between-group variance = scaled between-group variance????\nOr variance obtained from random intercept of GLMM\nicc = between-group variance/(between-group variance + pi^2/3)\nicc = between-group variance/(between-group variance + pi^2/3*(dispersion\nparameter))\nfor binomial GLMM\nicc = between-group variance/(between-group variance + 1/(p(1-p))\n\n\nI am a little confused which one to trust and use. Or there are no easy formulas\nto do this? I am guessing formula would change depending on what distribution\nyou use and what link function as well? I want to calculate icc from GLMM with\nPoisson with log link function and also binomial with logit function. Could\nanybody help me please?\n\nMany thanks for your help\n\nShinichi\n\n-- \nShinichi Nakagawa\nDept of Animal & Plant Sciences\nUniversity of Sheffield\nTel: 0114-222-0113\nFax: 0114-222-0002\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
