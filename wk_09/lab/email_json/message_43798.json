I've got the NetInst stuff from people.debian.org/~shane, but don't know if kernel 2.6.18 is the latest version in Testing.  I'm not sure if I want to run a mixed distribution: is this common with Debian?  \n    I know that none of the official Deb kernels contain Speakup.  Would I need to roll my own if I wanted to upgrade to Testing?\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
