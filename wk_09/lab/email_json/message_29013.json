Since the terms are contradictory, the recipient cannot\nsimultaneously satisfy all the terms of the license; thus the\nrecipient has no valid license in the work.\n\n-- \n \\       \"All good things are cheap; all bad are very dear.\"  -- Henry |\n  `\\                                                     David Thoreau |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
