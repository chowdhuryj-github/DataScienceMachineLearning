If you want to use loadings in stats,\nyou will have to use it by saying stats::loadings because it's masked\nand then\nyou use loadings from pls by just saying loadings. Other than that,\nthere's no problem I don't think.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Ron Crump\nSent: Thursday, May 17, 2007 8:03 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] Problem loading library\n\nHi,\n\nI have a fresh install of R 2.5.0, I then installed the pls package.\nWhen trying to load this package I get:\n\n > library(pls)\n\nAttaching package: 'pls'\n\n\n         The following object(s) are masked from package:stats :\n\n          loadings\n\n >\n\nSearches show this to most often be related to attaching data, but I\nhaven't got any data in here: this is the first command given after\nstart-up and no historical files were loaded.\n\nIs there some dependency I am missing or something I need to load first,\nor do I need to unload some default library before I can use pls?\n\nAny solutions welcome.\n\nRegards,\nRon.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
