Maintaining the full trust topology (including transitive\n    trusts).  These should be accessed by child processes\n    using the wcache_tdc_xxx() functions.\n\n2.  Support for one-way trusts\n\n3.  Working offline logons with remote idmap backends\n\n4.  Updated set_dc_and_flags() functionality based on trust\n    information from our primary domain.  This means we\n    should be able to avoid contacting remote domains\n    (inside our forest).\n\nThere's other minor fixes.  I tried to break the commits\nup into manage chunks (about 30 I think).\n\nAll of this is working in my local tree but I'll spend a good\nbit of time testing tomorrow and make sure I haven't introduced\nany regressions.  Might take a day or so to stabilize.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGPlieIR7qMdg1EfYRAo0eAKCmjNX17wgQPAxBjvHLjSqmUwXnZACfeYlF\nlIt/uKM04MdZegAy+sdgqik=\n=Vv50\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
