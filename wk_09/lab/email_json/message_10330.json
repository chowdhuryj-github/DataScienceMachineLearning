We provide binaries for\nDebian users because we believe that it makes it easier for the user\nto install the program. But one needs to know how to use them, and the\nR FAQ has a lot to say on the matter, incl a point of Debian / Ubuntu\npackages.\n\nDirk\n\n-- \nHell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something. \n                                                  -- Thomas A.
