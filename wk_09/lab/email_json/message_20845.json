It has pmvnorm, which does the integrals \nover rectangular regions. You'll need a pretransformation to use it for \nthe problem at hand, though (from (x,y) to (x,y-3x)).\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
