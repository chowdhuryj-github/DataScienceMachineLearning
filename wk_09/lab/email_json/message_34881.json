The list of names/numbers is \npregenerated in include/parrot/debug.h.  See the section starting:\n\n/*\n * These constants correspond to the debugger commands and are\n * used in src/debug.c. To map command strings to their\n * numeric values, use the algorithm from parse_command() in that file.\n */\n\n#define c_b             25245\n[etc.]\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
