Miller's Subset Selection in Regression(1990), and I\nfound what I was talking about adjusted R^2 was exactly as you\nsaid--Fisher's A-statisitc. The formula of adjusted R^2 without the\nintercept in that book was also the same as what summary(lm)$adj.r.squared\ndoes in R. I guess what you want me to derive is the formula in that book.\n\nThough I know the formula of adjusted R2 for non-central moments, I still\nwant to know whether I am in the right way to compare *linear models with\nintercept and those without intercept using maximizing adjs R^2 strategy.*\n**\n Actually, I consider the left column consisted of all 1 in predictor matrix\nZ as the intercept term. Then I apply maximizing adjs R^2 strategy to decide\nwhich variables to select. Z is the term in the model: Y=Zb+e.\n\nThanks for your suggestion, and I am looking forward for your reply.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of ???\n> Sent: Sunday, May 20, 2007 8:53 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] How to compare linear models with intercept and those\n> withoutintercept using minimizing adjs R^2 strategy\n>\n> Dear R-list,\n>\n> I apologize for my many emails but I think I know how to desctribe my\n> problem differently and more clearly.\n>\n> My question is how to compare linear models with intercept and those\n> without intercept using maximizing adjusted R^2 strategy.\n>\n> Now I do it like the following:\n>\n> > library(leaps)\n> > n=20\n> > x=matrix(rnorm(n*3),ncol=3)\n> > b=c(1,2,0)\n> > intercept=1\n> > y=x%*%b+rnorm(n,0,1)+intercept\n> >\n> > var.selection=leaps(cbind(rep(1,n),x),y,int=F,method=\"adjr2\")\n> > ##### Choose the model with maximum adjr2\n> > var.selection$which[var.selection$adjr2==max(var.selection$adjr2),]\n>    1     2     3     4\n> TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n>\n>\n> Actually, I use the definition of R-square in which the model is without\n> a intercept term.\n>\n> Is what I am doing is correct?\n>\n> Thanks for any suggestion or correction.\n> --\n> Junjie Li,                  klijunjie@gmail.com\n> Undergranduate in DEP of Tsinghua University,\n>\n>        [[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nJunjie Li,                  klijunjie@gmail.com\nUndergranduate in DEP of Tsinghua University,\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
