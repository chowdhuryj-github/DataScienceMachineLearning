I must\nchange my data column MB/s to MBs.  R seems to think that the \"s\" is another\ncolumn if I try to use MB/s.  Is there a way that I can make R allow special\ncharacters in the column names?\n\nThe second step to getting this to work was to remove the dozen or so\nadditional columns that are part of my csv but have no relevance to the\ngraph. Does R want me to pass code telling it to filter out unneeded\ncolumns?\n\nRegards,\n\nBen\n\n\nPatrick Connolly-2 wrote:\n> \n> On Fri, 20-Apr-2007 at 11:10PM -0500, Jeffrey Horner wrote:\n> \n> \n> |> workdir <- '/tmp/data'\n> |> for (x in dir(workdir,pattern='.csv$')){\n> |>    d <- read.table(paste(workdir,'/',x,sep=''), sep=\"\\t\", header=TRUE)\n> \n> If they're CSV files, I don't think sep = \"\\t\" will be correct.
