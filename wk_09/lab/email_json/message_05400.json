No act is so private it does not seek applause.\n\nIt is not death that alarms me, but dying.\n\nBeing the boss anywhere is lonely.  Being a female boss in a world of mostly men is especially so.\n\nA camel is a horse designed by a committee.\n\nThe peace makers shall be called the children of God.\n\nMy advice to any diplomat who wants to have a good press is to have two or three kids and a dog.\n\nI find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.\n\nEthics must begin at the top of an organization. It is a leadership issue and the chief executive must set the example.\n\nMy belief is that no movie, nothing in life, leaves people neutral. You either leave them up or you leave them down.\n\n\n"}
