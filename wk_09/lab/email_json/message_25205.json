The Wuthering Heights star - \nwho lives in the South Hams peninsula on the Devon coast - has installed \nCCTV cameras on a nearby beach so she can spy on the public \nthoroughfare, according to British newspaper Mail On Sunday.\n\nA resident says, \"She's since had the original path re-cut for her own \nuse and we've heard she might be trying to get it closed to the public \nnow because four solid fence posts have been driven into the side of the \nhill... But she can't do that. It's a right of way and she knew that \nwhen she bought the place.\"\n\nA councilor adds, \"I'm afraid the coast path and the beach were there \nlong before Kate Bush and I'm fairly confident they'll still be in the \nsame place with the same unhindered access long after she's gone.\"\n\n\n- Donny\n\n\n\n................................................................\n       Posted via TITANnews - Uncensored Newsgroups Access\n             >>>> at http://www.TitanNews.com <<<<\n-=Every Newsgroup - Anonymous, UNCENSORED, BROADBAND Downloads=-\n\n"}
