EUCI has designed its 5th annual interactive conference to bring together energy leaders in this quest as well as forward-thinking consultancies.\nThe focus of this event is on the experiences of individual utilities and energy companies, each sharing the lessons they have learned from new product and service development and deployment. The conference is filled with case study presentations to enable attendees to learn from the successes and challenges of others. The conference brings together experiences of both regulated and non-regulated utilities to share marketing ideas and strategies that have been successful.\nThe focus for this conference addresses four main components:\n* Using technology to effectively segment target markets\n          * Determining new products and services for commercial and industrial customers\n          * Emerging products and services for residential markets\n          * Leveraging the contact center to deliver new products and services to customers\n\n          Each session has case study presentations to help you decide which products and services to offer in order to grow your business and promote customer satisfaction. Learn what you can do to offer new products and services, re-offer old products and services in a new regulatory environment, or revitalize current product and service offerings by using new marketing technology, partnering with external companies, and partnering with internal organizations.\nAttendees learn from the experiences of nine companies, answering such critical questions as:\n* How do we choose which product or service to launch?\n          * How much investment should we make toward product development?\n          * How closely should we factor market research into our product design?\n          * How will we launch the product and get customer attention?\n          * What response rate represents a success?\n          * How can we launch new products and services with a minimal investment?\n          * How does revenue generated benefit a regulated utility?\n          * How can we identify customer needs to fit our abilities?\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nThe target audience for this conference includes:\n* Vice Presidents of Marketing\n          * General Managers, Directors, and Project Managers involved in Marketing, Marketing Analytics, Market Research, Customer Strategies, Market Planning & Research and/or Business Development\n          * Directors and Managers of Products & Services\n          * Analysts and Planners in Strategic Marketing\n          * Managers of Key Accounts\n          * Customer Services and Marketing\n          * Product Development and Consumer Product Marketing\n          * Contact Center Management\n\n          WHAT PAST ATTENDEES HAVE SAID:\n\u201cAs a new employee in the utility industry, this conference packed three months of training into two days.\u201d\n          ~ B.C., Market Analyst, Dominion\n\u201cThe EUCI conference on developing and launching new products and services provided several thought provoking ideas and concepts warranting further investigation withinmy company\u2019s business model.
