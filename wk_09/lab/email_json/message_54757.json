I would like to plot the actual raw data points\nfor each subject for both pre and post and connect lines between these two\npoints (20 in all) to depict real change between the two timepoints.\n\nI have tried using stripchart which adequately plots the two lines of\nsubject data points.  Attempting to use segments however has been\ndifficult.  It seems that the segments command gives too many coordiate\npoints - so where segments has:\n\nx0, y0, x1, y1\n\nI really only have two coordinates for each point -\n\npre to post\n\nI am sure that I am misusing the command but not sure if I should continue\nto try with segments or if there is another command that would be more\nappropriate.\n\nAs always, thanks for any help.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
