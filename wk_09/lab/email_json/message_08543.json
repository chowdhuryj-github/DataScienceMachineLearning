I had asked a \nquestion about how to get a installation of linux running in a vm, \nand, I have to say that I did get it working. It Turned out to be \nvery easy, but, I was wondering about sound support in the vm as I \nwas just using speakup through my serial port. It was kind of cool \nwhen I got it working as I was on skype on the windows host and it \nnever gave me any trouble, but, I am guessing that getting some sort \nof software synth working would not work unless I had another \nsoundcard to rout it through? I am not even sure if I can find \ndrivers for my soundcard that is built into this laptop, but, that is \na question for another time I suppose. If someone can tell me more \nabout how this kind of thing works, that would be wonderful. I \nnoticed that someone did get software speech going with a vm, so, \nfigured I would ask.\nThanks bunches.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
