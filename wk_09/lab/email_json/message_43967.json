No need to worry about differences between header and  \nsource, because the header comes from it.  It'll also auto-generate  \nattributes for each of the functions that work with GCC.\n\nYesterday there was a problem where I forgot to put PARROT_API on the  \nfunction in source, so linking on Windows broke.  If that happens  \nagain, here's what you do:\n\n* Run Configure.pl\n* Update the source with PARROT_API above the return type\n* Run \"make headerizer\"\n\nThe .h file should now have PARROT_API for the function in question.\n\nxoxo,\nAndy\n\n\n--\nAndy Lester => andy@petdance.com => www.petdance.com => AIM:petdance\n\n\n\n\n"}
