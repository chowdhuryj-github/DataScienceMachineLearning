Ideally, I want to be able to go row by row for the two matrices using\napply for the ccf function and get one 196000 X 1 array output.  The apply\nfunction though wants only one array, no?  Basically, is there a way to use\napply when there are two arrays in order to do something like correlation on\na row by row basis?\nThanks for your help\n\nMichael\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
