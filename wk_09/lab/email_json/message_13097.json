I applied tewk's patch and Patrick R's comments, then pulled \nmore comments out of the thread and cleaned up the code a bit (reusing \nthe new macros where relevant). What I ultimately ended up with (based \non which idioms were repeated and so most in need of macros) is \nsomewhere between tewk's patch and Patrick R's patch.\n\n(chromatic and I have been talking about holding a \"file of the week\" \ncleanup task. This is a great start on the first one.)\n\nAllison\n\n"}
