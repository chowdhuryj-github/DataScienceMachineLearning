Furthermore, these two lines are\nnot documented in the acf documentation. I don't know what they are for, but\nit seems that they are important. Could someone tell me what they are and\nhow are they calculated?\n\nThanks,\n\n-- \nTom\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
