I am using svm function on about 180,000 points of training set. It takes very long time to run. However, I would like it to spit out something to make sure that the run is not dead in between.  Would you please suggest anyway to do so? \n\nAnd is there anyway to speed up the performance of this svm function? Thank you.\n\n- adschai\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
