The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame.\nFootprints on the sands of time are not made by sitting down.\nSlumber not in the tents of your fathers. The world is advancing.\nDon't count your chickens before they are hatched.\nI never worry about action, but only inaction.\nThere isn't a single human characteristic that can be safely labeled as ''American.''\nOur progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.\nThe splendid discontent of God With chaos made the world. And from the discontent of man The worlds best progress springs.\nBooks give not wisdom where none was before. But where some is, there reading makes it more.\nHe who opens a school door, closes a prison.\nHe that complies against his will is of his own opinion still.\nBut what is all this fear of and opposition to Oblivion? What is the matter with the soft Darkness, the Dreamless Sleep?\nA wicked book cannot repent.\nChess is ruthless: you've got to be prepared to kill people.\nA good swordsman is not given to quarrel.\n\u00a0"}
