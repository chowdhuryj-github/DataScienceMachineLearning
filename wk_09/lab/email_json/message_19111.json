Lost to fame, let me love river and woodland.\n\nAs threshing separates the wheat from the chaff, so does affliction purify virtue.\n\nThe moment an ill can be patiently handled, it is disarmed of its poison, though not of its pain.\n\nBondage is... subjection to external influences and internal negative thoughts and attitudes.\n\nWhere women are concerned, the rule is never to go out with anyone better dressed than you.\n\nFreedom exists only with power.\n\nNothing happens unless first a dream.\n\nNothing is cheap which is superfluous, for what one does not need, is dear at a penny.\n\n\n"}
