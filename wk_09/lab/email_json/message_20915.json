Try the\nfollowing ...\n\n> plot(1, ann=FALSE)\n> title(ylab=expression(epsilon[\"\\136\"]), family=\"symbol\")\n\nThe plain text character \"\\136\" gets drawn using the symbol font and the\nperpendicular symbol is character 94 (Octal 136) in the Adobe Symbol\nEncoding and in the Windows symbol font encoding so this works for PDF,\non Windows, and on X11 (though I had to switch to a single-byte encoding\nto get my system to pick up the symbol font).  The drawback with this\nsolution is that anything that is NOT a special mathematical symbol in\nthe expression will come out in Greek letters.\n\nPaul\n\n\n> Many thanks for your help,\n> \n> \n> -Matt\n> \n> \n> \n> On Sat Apr 28 17:35 , 'Gabor Grothendieck'  sent:\n> \n>> Its available in the Hershey fonts:\n>>\n>> plot(0, 0, type = \"n\")\n>> text(0, 0, \"A \\\\pp B\", vfont = c(\"serif\", \"plain\"))\n>>\n>>\n>> On 4/28/07, Matthew Neilson matt@gneilson.plus.com> wrote:\n>>> Hey,\n>>>\n>>> Does anyone know of an equivalent to the LaTeX \\perp (perpendicular)\n>>> symbol for adding to R plots?
