It is straightforward in the 1d case, like \nqnorm(seq(0,1,length=5)) but for 2d I'd need more constraints.\n\nAny suggestions for how to approach this?  Is seems like a spatial \nsampling problem but I'm not sure where to look.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nDave\n-- \n  Dr. David Forrest\n  drf@vims.edu                                    (804)684-7900w\n  drf5n@maplepark.com                             (804)642-0662h\n                                    http://maplepark.com/~drf5n/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
