This is important \nfor free speech.\n\n> 1) \"License the Universe\"\n> \n> Any reasonable use of a work means it is \"contained\" in something else\n> whose license you are not able to, or should not attempt, to control.\n\n\"Contained\" is not a legal term AFAIK and as you are using it here seems \nto cover both use and distribution (in GPL-2 terms).\n\n> For example, an HTML page \"contains\" an image. \n\nThe code for an HTML page does not contain an image. The rendering of an \nHTML page will create an image that combines the text of the html with \nthe pixels of the image in a single unit. This is use.\n\n> A website \"contains\" an HTML page. \n\nThis is borderline. There is nothing in the site that causes a single \nunit to be rendered incorporating all of its \"contained\" units, but some \nsites that is a single work (eg an encyclopaedia).\n\nCDs of music are an interesting case. People sometimes don't seem to \nexpect BY-SA music to be distributable alongside non-free work.\n\n> The Internet \"contains\" the website.  \n\nAgain no single usable unit is ever created that includes all the \n\"contained\" units. This is distribution.\n\n> Given that this can clearly be taken\n> to unreasonable extremes, where should the line be drawn?

They allow any license (including other free licenses) to be\n> applied to \"mere containers\" and to siblings within the same container,\n> so they prevent lock-ups due to license incompatibility.\n\nThis does not ensure that the users of the \"mere container\" have the \nsame freedom as the creator of the \"mere container\". Where its creator \nhas used free work to achieve the sum effect of a single rendered unit \nthis is a loss of freedom.\n\n> Thus, if I have an HTML page with GFDL, GPL, By, and By-SA images in it\n> (not to mention \"verbatim use only\", \"By-NC-ND\", or \"fair use\" images),\n> then -- if a container-binding copyleft is applied to any of the above\n> \"free\" licenses -- the licensing is locked up and I cannot publish.\n\nDoes the page \"use\" the images? If so the freedom that the creator of \nthe page enjoys should not be a privilege that they can deny others.\n\n> As things stand we have a situation with some admitted faults -- it may\n> be a little *too* free.

So using \nphotographs as illustrations could be added as another similar clause.\n\nOr we could recognize that the existence of two such exceptions \nindicates a more general principle and try to codify it, using them as \nexamples.\n\nOr we could accept that this is more problematic than the musical case \nand simply explain the licenses better to photographers.\n\n- Rob.\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
