Yes, you can pass your mainFrame \nobject to a function.  Will it work?  Well, that depends on what you do \nwith it.\n\nCould you put together a small example showing the sort of thing you \nwant to do?  If it works, then you probably don't need to post a \nquestion; if it doesn't, someone can probably point out what changes are \nnecessary.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
