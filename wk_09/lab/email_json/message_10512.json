Now that you have\nr-base-dev and what it pulled it, your next attempts at installing from CRAN\n(under sudo) should work.  \n\nAlso,  'apt-cache search r-cran-' is one way to see the already-prepared\npackages you wouldn't need to rebuild.\n\nLastly, be a little careful mixing 'update.packages()' from inside R with\ndpkg and sudo --- the R package system doesn't really know about Debian and\npackages it didn't install itself, so some care may avoid surprises. I am not\naware of anything really bad happening, but just be aware that you are mixing\ntwo packaging systems.\n\nHappy R'ing on Ubuntu,  Dirk\n\n-- \nHell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something. \n                                                  -- Thomas A.
