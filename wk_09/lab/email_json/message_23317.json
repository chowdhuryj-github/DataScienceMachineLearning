Collins \n      \n\n\n\nDID YOU KNOW?Sea water is approximately 3.5 \n      percent salt. \n\n\n\nSATURDAY\nON 48 HOURSHere's a note \n      from Troy Roberts on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, POWER, \n      PASSION AND POISON: \"Kathy Augustine was a \n      rising star in Nevada state politics. Smart, ambitious, tough and \n      attractive she quickly ascended to one of the highest offices in the state \n      and many expected she'd eventually end up working in national politics. \n      But last year Kathy Augustine was found unconscious in her bed and later \n      died at the hospital. She was fifty-years-old. At first it was assumed \n      that Augustine died from a heart attack. But her family and friends didn't \n      believe it could be possible. Augustine had her annual physical just a \n      week before her death. She was given a clean bill of health and there was \n      no family history of heart disease. It just didn't add up. \n      Toxicology tests were ordered on fluid samples taken from \n      Augustine and the results shocked everyone. Traces of the powerful \n      paralytic drug Succinylcholine were found in her system. The drug is \n      normally given to patients to ease the insertion of a breathing tube. It \n      acts fast and nearly vanishes from the body within minutes...making it \n      extremely difficult to detect. Suspicions quickly fell on Augustine's \n      husband of three years, Chazz Higgs. The pair seemed an unlikely couple. \n      He was eight-years her junior. He was a bodybuilder who had three failed \n      marriages behind him. His relationship with Kathy was troubled as well. In \n      the months leading up to Augustine's death they had discussed divorce. But \n      there was more. Chaz Higgs was a critical care nurse and he had access to \n      Succincolyine. He knew how to adminster it and, most importantly, he knew \n      the drug could be potentially deadly. And then a witness came forward with \n      a damning claim about his allegedly role in the crime. Chazz Higgs \n      goes on trial for the murder of Kathy Augustine next month. Higgs claims \n      he is innocent. When we sat down for the interview, that you'll see this \n      weekend, he agreed to talk about the charges against him...charges that \n      could send him to prison for life, and you'll hear his theories on who \n      would want his wife dead...and why. I hope you'll join us on Saturday \n      night.\" - Troy Roberts (48 Hours Mystery \n      airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT) If you would like more \n      information on any of these stories or the broadcast, please click on the \n      following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n      \n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWSHere's an early look at what we are working on for \n      tonight's broadcast of the CBS Evening News, from Anchor and Managing \n      Editor, Katie Couric..

And the same philosophy seems to apply to \n      how they intend to go into the great beyond. Instead of a traditional \n      burial, more and more people are opting for cremation these days. And \n      there are more and more ways to turn those ashes into memorials to the \n      departed. They can be scattered at sea, or made into jewelry, sporting \n      equipment, artificial reefs, or even fireworks. One of the most dramatic \n      tributes is to shoot them into space. Last weekend, Bill Geist \n      traveled to New Mexico where a private rocket launched so-called \n      \"cremains\" of 202 people into space. Onboard were some of the ashes of \n      pioneering astronaut Zombie Cooper and James Doohan-\"Scotty\" from Star \n      Trek. We'll meet the families of some of those on-board, and learn \n      more about how the baby boomers are redefining even death.
