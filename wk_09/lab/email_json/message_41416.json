And where do I \nobtain the latest and greatest LibspeechD library component that is needed \nto see if Speech-Dispatcher continues crashing?\nAlso, Hynek  or something else who is developing this, could someone please \ntell me if these crashes wich you have been receiveing information on are \noccuring on SMP or non SMP kernels? BC Speech-Dispathcer segfaults and \ntoally shuts down (therefore closing all connections and requireing a manaul \nrestart) no matter whenever I use an SMP capable kernel. It will not do so, \nif I force the kernel to ignore the second processor, but this really \nseverely degrades my performance, and I can no longer bair to shut off SMP.\nI am leaving it alone and always on forever. I'm going to test with it in \nVMWare still, that is my plan. Thanks a lot.\nRegards, --Keith.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
