I'm a rabid Linux fanatic who \nwent blind from diabetic retinopathy in August of '02, and I've been \npretty much offline ever since.  Finally broke down and upgraded my \nsystem to support WinXP and quickly heard about SpeakUp for Linux.  I'm \nin the process of looking for a supported speech synth for SpeakUp, so \nI'm still stuck in Windows on a 30 minute Win-Eyes time limit.  I hope \nto soon get Slackware up and running, and soon be able to contribute to \nthe SpeakUp effort right along-side everyone.  I'm presently playing \naround with a copy of Oralux and learning the features.  Just need that \nspeech synthesizer, and I should be off and running.  Thank you for all \nyour efforts.  It is well appreciated.\n\n     Best regards,\n         Michael \"Foreign White Devil\" Ferranti\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
