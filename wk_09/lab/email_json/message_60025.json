[The\nmain problem with the Gentoo logo is that it doesn't have a licence\nstatement which allows users to modify the logo.]\n\nThe decision as to which solution to use is of course the\nmaintainer's.\n \n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nPowerPoint is symptomatic of a certain type of bureaucratic\nenvironment: one typified by interminable presentations with lots of\nfussy little bullet-points and flashy dissolves and soundtracks masked\ninto the background, to try to convince the audience that the goon\nbehind the computer has something significant to say.\n -- Charles Stross _The Jennifer Morgue_ p33\n\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
