But I think it was different when \n*most* of the posts were about speakup and maybe somebody would ask about a \ncharacter-based program for whatever. It seems that the vast majority of \nposts to this list are now about ubuntu and/or orca.\n\nI know there is a list for orca developers. Maybe there should be one for \nubuntu & orca users. And there is a list for blind linux users. \n(blinux-list-request@redhat.comm)\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
