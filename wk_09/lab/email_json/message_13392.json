A derivative work is a work  \nthat would attract its own copyright. So having derivation as the  \ncopyleft trigger fits copyright law perfectly.\n\nThere seem to be two major cases where this does not fit people's  \nexpectations: the use of a piece of music in a film soundtrack and the  \nuse of a photograph as a magazine illustration. The former has been  \nworked into the CC licenses as a special case where copyleft is  \ntriggered by something other than derivation, the latter has not.\n\nSo I don't think that we can say that the licenses should only concern  \nthemselves with how copyright law works; there are already examples of  \nwhere they do not do this (NC is another).\n\n- Rob.\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
