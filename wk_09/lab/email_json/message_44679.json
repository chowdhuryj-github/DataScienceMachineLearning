Do you have to archive with your institution? If this is a\nrequirement for your graduation, then do whatever you need to do and\nforget about it, but choose the less restrictive option, and then\nself-archive somewhere online (SSRN or with other self-archiving method).\n2. If you don't need to archive with them, then self-archive under a CC\nlicence.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndres\n\nMuthiah Annamalai wrote:\n> Hello there,\n>\n> I'm a grad student at this school and I am writing my thesis.\n> I'm a big fan of open-[access,source,wiki] concepts, and contribute\n> from  time to time.\n>\n> The thesis document process at my school is generally archived at UMI.\n> They have 2 options either a restrictive copyright agreement, or something\n> like the GFDL.
