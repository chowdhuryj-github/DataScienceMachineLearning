If I interact with an ATM that  \ncommunicates\nwith a server that requrests data from a web service that uses a database\nthat is covered by the AGPL ... am I interacting with it? Is it being  \ncoveyed?\nWhat if the AGPL is in the web service? It still has no UI itself. Is the\nATM customer interacting with that?\nIf not, the AGPL would be trivial to cicumvent by splitting the covered\npart into a separate component without a UI and interacting with it\n\"remotely\".\n\n/L\n-- \nLasse R.
