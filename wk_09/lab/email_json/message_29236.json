An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility.\n\nIt feels like a barbell. [When asked what she thought of her newly acquired Oscar statuette]\n\nMany miles away there's a shadow on the door of a cottage on the Shore of a dark Scottish lake.\n\nWhatever poet, orator, or sage may say of it, old age is still old age.\n\nStrong beliefs win strong men, and then make them stronger.\n\nOne of the stupidest theories of Western life.\n\nOne person with a belief is equal to a force of ninety-nine who have only interests.\n\nLove is a chain of love as nature is a chain of life.\n\nGo ahead, make my day.\n\nAs he that fears God hears nothing else, so, he that sees God sees every thing else.\n\nReading makes immigrants of us all.
