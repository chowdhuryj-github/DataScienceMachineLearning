I was just focused on marginal or population-averaged\nestimation, so the use of cluster() in the argument for survreg() and\nthe robust option in survreg() to get sandwich error estimates was\nsufficient for me. Depending on your needs to evaluate random effects,\nfrailty() in the survival package -- which can be used with survreg() or\ncoxph() --- is another alternative to explore, I believe.\n\nHope that helps,\nBill\nNonclinical Statistics, Centocor R & D\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch]On Behalf Of Spielas Grove\n> Sent: Monday, April 23, 2007 2:29 PM\n> To: Bert Gunter\n> Cc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: Re: [R] fitting mixed models to censored data?\n> \n> \n> Hi Bert,\n> \n> Yes, I am always wary when one software offers something that\n> other do not.\n> \n> The censoring I'm faced with (at present) isn't as complicated\n> as with much 'survival' data.
