It needs to be reapplied, and then checked that it doesn't \nbreak anything (IIRC there were problems on Win32), hence why the \nticket is still open.  I've only just returned from 3 weeks overseas \nand haven't had time over the past couple of months to attack the \nticket.  If you have the tuits, go for it!  other than that, I'll have \na go at it hopefully sometime soon (famous last words...)\n\nPaul\n\n> I'd like to get this ticket (#41908) resolved.
