I\nfind that ironic because CD was intended as \"the\" long term storage\nsolution, when HDDs were flakey and FDD more so.  HDD technology has\nadvanced so much in the last 10 years, also flash memory technology, not\nforgetting the yet-to-be on-line storage \"for all\" solution.\n\nSo, I agree there's something nostalgic rather than practical about wanting\nsomething on a CD, vinyl or any kind of tactile media of yesteryear.\nHowever, I do feel there's something missing from the mix of medias these\ndays.  t-shirts have maintained their popularity, whilst printed materials\nare more than lacking in imagination, mostly due to the space restrictions.\n\nI've agreed previously with some of Drew's suggestions with regard to\nreproduction of artwork, something you can hang on your wall.  Some old\nalbum art I'm seriously considering framing up and putting on walls.  I'd\nnever consider doing this with CD artwork due to the size, and artwork I've\nseen downloaded with online audio purchases is little more than a thumbnail.\nI'm sure there's a merchandise opportunity waiting to happen for some\nenterprising internet entrepreneur who simply provides A4/letter-size cover\nart as an accompanying download.  It's all about adding value in my mind.\n\nSpeaking of value add and quality issues.....\n\n>From the selfish perspective of a virtual musician wanting to deliver his\nart in it's optimum form (yes I include myself in that description) a CD is\nnowadays an inferior \"format\".  16bit Stereo 44.1KHz?  Only makes sense if\nyou're mastering for some gad-awful 90s technology like MP3 ;)\n\nDVD-audio http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Audio has a much more interesting\nset of options.  For instance I record most of my instrumentation via Cubase\nat 24bit 192KHz on a \"low cost\" audio card made by E-MU.  You CAN hear the\ndifference on half-way decent speakers.  It makes me queasy to think that\npeople are paying money to various online outlets for low quality lossy\naudio.  It's an age-old gripe, but I feel it's a valid one.\n\nMy suggestion would be to forget about CD audio, that's replaced effectively\nby the lossless codecs like flac and ape (which you should prefer btw).\nPush the technology envelope, put yourself out there on the edge ;) ....have\nthe artists master their work in hi-def, surround sound if they wish!\n\nJust my 2p....good luck with the project! :D\n\nKev\n\n> _______________________________________________\n> cc-community mailing list\n> cc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\n> http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n>\n>\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
