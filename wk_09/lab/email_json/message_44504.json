You will be\nprompted for permission to continue; click continue.  On the\nscreen you will see a checkbox titled \"Use User Account Control\n(UAC) to help protect your computer\".  Uncheck this and click\nthe OK button to save the changes.  Windows Vista will now allow\nprograms, including R, to update files in \"Program Files\".\n\nRod.\n\n\n2007/6/7, Stefan Grosse :\n> Actually the packages R wants to update are: VR, cluster, lattice, mgcv,\n> nlme and rcompgen. I did how described in the R-Win-FAQ create a\n> .Renviron File containing the path to the win-library that R already\n> created (R_LIBS=C: ... ). I also tried to add R_LIBS= as Rgui parameter\n> from within Tinn-R. Additionally I tried to leave a file named\n> Renviron.site in the etc library.
