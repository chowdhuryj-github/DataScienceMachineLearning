I got a new dell, and was not blessed with having serial \nports on the motherboard.  I'm gonna install Ubuntu 7.04 tomorrow, so \nif no one can recommend a good synth that will work with speakup, can \nsomeone point me in the right way of getting it up and running with \n7.04?  There are times when I'd rather work at the command line \nrather than gui.  Thanks in advance for all the help.\n\n\nGuy\nP.S.  I guess I have a couple more questions after downloading and \nburning the ISO.  What is the best way to get firefox 3, and how do \nyou go about getting a spoken install with 7.04?  Thanks again for \nall the help.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
