{"category": "ham", "to_address": "beginners@perl.org", "from_address": "Jeni Zundel <jenizundel@mac.com>", "subject": "Perl vs. Java for string manipulation & regex", "body": "So, recently, I wrote a nice little perl script to go through a  \nmoderately large file (about 400 Meg fixed record length file of rows  \nthat are 1870 characters wide).  It runs quite fast; provides  \naccurate results and I'm happy with it.\n\nMy employer doesn't want to use it because it's in perl and he  \ndoesn't think that anyone else in the building knows perl.  So, I  \ndecided to work on my java syntax (recently started doing a bit of  \njava) and use java in order to manipulate the file instead.\n\nMy perl script basically does 2 things:\n\n1.  selects rows that have .{51}055 in them.\n2.  based on those selected rows, pull out just a few different  \ntagged locations as the appropriate data fields.  (the file is a VSAM  \nrecord and has a ton of valueless crap in it that we don't want.\n\nI've basically rewritten the thing w/ a simple POJO; I'm not using  \nregex within java because I'm impatient & didn't feel like reading  \nall of the api documentation on the different objects for using regex  \n(but I will eventually).  In any event, I found that I didn't need  \nregex in java because I could use a substring command instead.\n\nIt is significantly less efficient than the perl script.  So my  \nquestions are:\n\n1.  Is the java significantly slower than the perl script because I  \nsuck at writing efficient java code or because perl is just really  \nthat much better at string manipulation?\nand\n2.  Does anyone know if the java would be significantly improved if I  \nmake use of regex instead of using substring functions?\n\nthanks in advance,\nJen\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
