And people do seem to jump on the fashionable\nbandwagon, which is currently \"carbon footprints\" (and \"organic farming\",\nalthough I didn't know anything inorganic could ever grow).\n\nAnd on the topic of organic farming (since I brought it up), I find\nit interesting after a few years of that fad, that many scientists\nare now showing that \"organic\" products are not any tastier, nor any\nbetter nutrient-wise, and that fertilizing with sh*t carries way more\nrisks and contains nasty by-products.\n\nHumans really don't have a clue, do they!\n\n"}
