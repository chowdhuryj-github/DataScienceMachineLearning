A colleague of mine recently published a similar study on JAMA, but he used OpenBUGS - a software I'm not familiar with...\n\nIf there is any tip/suggestion for a possible syntax, could someone send me? I need to finish this paper before my PhD qualify, but I'm completely stuck...\n\nSo, any tip will be more than welcome...I will really appreciate it!!! \n\nThanks in advance and congrats on the amazing mailing-list.\n\n\n\nBests from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nMonica\n\n \n\n \n\nMonica Malta\nResearcher\nOswaldo Cruz Foundation - FIOCRUZ\nSocial Science Department - DCS/ENSP\nRua Leopoldo Bulhoes, 1480 - room 905\nManguinhos\nRio de Janeiro - RJ 21041-210\nBrazil\nphone +55.21.2598-2715\nfax +55.21.2598-2779\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
