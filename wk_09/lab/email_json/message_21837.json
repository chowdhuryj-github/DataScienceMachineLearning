To get minutes you can multiply that value by\n24*60\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nfor my $file (<.* *>) {\n        print \"$file is \", int(24*60 * -M $file), \" minutes old\\n\";\n}\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
