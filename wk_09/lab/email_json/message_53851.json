This  decision was  based on the  automatic error\nmonitoring policy  in effect for the  list, and has not  been reviewed or\notherwise confirmed  by a human  being. If  you receive this  message, it\nmeans that  something is wrong: while  you are obviously able  to receive\nmail, your mail system has been regularly reporting that your account did\nnot exist, or that you were otherwise permanently unable to receive mail.\nHere is some information which may assist  you or your local help desk in\ndetermining the cause of the problem:\n\n- The failing address is ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA.\n\n- The first error was reported on 22 Jun 2007.\n\n- Since then, a total of 3 delivery errors have been received.\n\n- The last reported error was: Probe failed.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT  IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. While you can  of course re-subscribe\nto the list, it is important for  you to report this problem to your mail\nadministrator so that  it can be solved. This problem  is not specific to\nthe HTMLQUICKNEWS  list, and also  affects your private mail.  This means\nthat YOU HAVE  PROBABLY LOST SOME PRIVATE MAIL AS  WELL. Anyone trying to\nwrite to you  during the same time frame will  probably have received the\nsame errors for the same reason. The HTMLQUICKNEWS list is but one of the\nmany people who may have tried to write to you while your mail system was\nmalfunctioning.\n\n\n"}
