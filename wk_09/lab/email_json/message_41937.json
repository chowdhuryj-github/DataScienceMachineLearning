I can get a result from polr fit by calling\n\nresult.plr <- polr(formula, data=mydata, method=\"probit\");\n\nHowever, from the 'result.plr', how can I access standard error of the estimated coefficients as well as the t statistics for each one of them?\n\nWhat I would like to do ultimately is to see which coefficients are not significant and try to refit the model again by excluding those variables out. I would appreciate if anyone could give some hint on this. Thank you.\n\n- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
