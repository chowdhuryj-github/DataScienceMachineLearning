However, some GG messages on this \nlist don't have perl-beginners[at]moderators.isc.org in the To: header, \nso GG has another way of getting messages onto this list.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
