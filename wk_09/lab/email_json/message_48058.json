I've written up a\nbrief specification/requirements list\n(http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget).\n\nWe're very interested in feedback from the list.  Are there any\nobvious use cases that we should consider that this *won't* work for?\nAnything we need to take into account as we implement?\n\nThanks,\n\nNathan\n\n-----\nNathan R.
