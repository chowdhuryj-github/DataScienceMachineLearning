Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\n\nIf we could sell our experience for what they cost us, we'd all be millionaires.\n\nUnlike grown ups, children have little need to deceive themselves.\n\nLuck is the idol of the idle.\n\nThey believe that nothing will happen because they have closed their doors.\n\nThere is no gilding of setting sun or glamour of poetry to light up the ferocious and endless toil of the farmers wives.\n\nIt is wise to learn it is God-like to create.\n\nI believe in democracy, because it releases the energies of every human being.\n\nIt isn't by size that you win or fail -- be the best of whatever you are.\n\nIn faith and hope the world will disagree, But all mankind's concern is charity.\n\nGood clothes open all doors.\n\nYou'll never find a better sparring partner than adversity.\n\n\n"}
