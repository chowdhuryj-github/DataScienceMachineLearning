My friend who is  assisting me says \nthat she has gotten XP up and running and partitioned  half of the drive \nnow so\nthat I can use the other half of it for Linux.   I should get the \ncomputer back tomorrow or Saturday, and then we'll see  what happens \nwhen I try to install\nagain.\n\nAs for Speakup, I've noticed on my desktop machine, where I also use \nthe  Dectalk Express, that Speakup will suddenly stop reading when I'm \nin the  middle\nof reading such things as compiling Gnome-speech or when Yum  updates my \nsystem.  It will be talking, then it suddenly stops talking,  I have to \nrefresh\nthe screen in order for it to start talking again.   Very strange indeed!\n\nI suspect I'll be posting here again when I try and do the dual boot  \nthing, as I haven't done this before.\n\nThanks,\n\nBeth\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
