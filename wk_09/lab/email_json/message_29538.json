How about a separate package, maybe\n'ttf-vistafonts' or 'msvistacorefonts' which is in no way connected to\nthe 'msttcorefonts' package and shows a debconf warning about the\nrestrictions these fonts are subject to?\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
