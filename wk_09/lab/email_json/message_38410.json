This would\nmake more sense I think.  Then you would have complete\ncontrol over the Fedora packages posted to samba.org and I\nwould be able to dig into dpkg (which I've been interested\nin doing anyways since I've completed the migration of my\nservers to Ubuntu).\n\nThe 3.0.26 release might be a good swap over point.  Let me\nknow if you are interested.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXHSiIR7qMdg1EfYRAnCHAJ91yCe6lmvoWGFguDKTYJlvRlRNFACfbDMZ\nU2ns81ii4DRPY7xGy2rZzSM=\n=p/Iv\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
