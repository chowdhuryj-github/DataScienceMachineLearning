This means that the boundary between two cells is not always\nhalf-way between nodes, as levelplot() assumes.  The result is that some\ncell sizes are rendered incorrectly, which can be painfully obvious if\nusing relatively large cells.  Is there any work-around?  I am using the\nconditioning capability of lattice and therefore image() would not be a\ngood way to go.\n\nThanks, \nScott Waichler\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory\nscott.waichler _at_ pnl.gov\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
