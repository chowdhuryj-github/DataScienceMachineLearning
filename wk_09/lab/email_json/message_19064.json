It is being generated as I'm\nable to send out all the emails necessary.\n\nThe way I'm doing it now is to use a variable which holds a small\nmessage to be inserted into the email.  However, I don't know how to\ndynamically format that variable with the data I'm sending.\n\nThe data looks like this:\n\n  Ticket ID    hh:mm\n---------------------\n     000000    00:00\n     111111    11:11\n     222222    22:22\n\nAnd so on.  That is what gets placed in the file but I'd prefer it be\nplaced inside the email.\n\nMathew\n\nNigel Peck wrote:\n> Mathew wrote:\n>> I have a script which creates a text file for each of several users.\n>> However, the contents of the file are rarely enough to warrant it.
