We just\nneed to say where the ldap server is.\nIt would be good to integrate also some \"directory\" feature such as\nDesktop definitions.\n\n> \n> Talking about the 'shared folders' thing, GNOME has the\n> Places->Network Servers and Places->Connect to Server.

Comments?\n\nNO, no, no ...\n\nShared folders are folders that you configure in the desktop (for\nexample) Most companies have a documentation folder that is a share on\nthe network.\nAlso, users have folders where they store settings, documents and other.\nLike $HOME/ is local, but then $HOME/Documents $HOME/server are all\nstored in the main server.\n\nFor this we can use libpam-mount with a few debconf settings.\nSo, sysadmin could set all preseed and install enterpeise desktops on\nthe fly with all set.\n\nAn interesting problem to solve is how to keep users settings (all\nthe .directories).\n\nOne workaround should be /home/user the server share.\nThen have an /home/user/local for local access. This is the opposite of\nis done now.\n\nThis would be a MAJOR advance in installing enterprise environments\nbased in debian (suse only do ldap user configuration).\n\nSo, we could use samba, or nfs (my election network filesystems) to\nload users info from the server And get them their desktop in any\ncomputer in the company.\n\n\n> \n> > >\n> > > * menu system: The Debian menu system needs to be reviewed for both\n> > > GNOME, KDE, Xfce usage and what to do to not break others WMs.\n> > >\n> > > * website and wiki: I need help with wiki articles general cleanup and\n> > > website maintenance.
