If not, I have no objections to\ndropping them, though it would be helpful to us if dropping them was done\npost-3.0.25.\n\nCheers,\n-- \nSteve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\nDebian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\nvorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n\n"}
