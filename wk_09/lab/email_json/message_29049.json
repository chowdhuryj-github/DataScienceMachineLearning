Among other things, it's a global change, when \nyou're more likely to want a very local selection of how you load libraries.\n\n> I really hope this does not sound whiny but review has been a problem\n> for me.

This is a roadblock for someone who's doing good work on \nParrot, so we want to get it cleared out as soon as possible. In this \ncase, I'll do the review. For many patches a simple code review is \nenough, but this is a change that affects the core of Parrot deeply \nenough and broadly enough that it needs architectural review. I don't \nalways see every message on the mailing list, but when I miss one, you \ncan email me directly, email Coke or particle so they can remind me, or \ncatch me on IRC during parrotsketch.\n\nAllison\n\n"}
