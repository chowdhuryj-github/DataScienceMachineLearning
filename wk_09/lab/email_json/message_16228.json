Just as the DS shunned the Game Boy name to appeal to a broader\naudience, the Wii would adopt a sleek white exterior instead of the\ntoylike loud colors used on the GameCube. Even CEO Iwata got involved in\nthe design process; at one point he handed engineers a stack of DVD jewel\ncases and told them the console should not be much bigger. Why so small?\nTo work with the motion-sensitive wireless controller Nintendo planned,\nIwata reasoned, the console would have to sit directly beside the TV.\nMake it any larger and customers would hesitate to leave it there. \"\nTheir sales strategy is working in spades.
