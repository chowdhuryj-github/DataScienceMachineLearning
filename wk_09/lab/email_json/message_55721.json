Are there easier ways to plot the y1, y2 w/o figuring out the correct\nscaler, tick vectors, and labels in order to put them in one figure?\n2. How to add additional 'ylab' to the right hand side y-axis of the plot?\nThanks a lot!\n\n-Young\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
