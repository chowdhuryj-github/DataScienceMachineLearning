I think the \nSynaptics touchpad was somehow related to pcmcia stuff (yenta socket) \nand hotplug used to recognize it automatically before the update.  \n(This was an Averatec 3250 laptop.)\n\nThe update introduced udev, but that didn't work for kernels older than \n2.6.15 (the Sarge kernel is 2.6.8) and it conflicted with hotplug.  Also \nthere was an issue related to pcmcia-cs (for older than 2.6.13) vs. \npcmcia-utils (for 2.6.13 or higher).\n\nMaybe making sure you have the Etch kernel, udev, and pcmcia-utils would \nsolve your touchpad problem.\n\nSelim T.
