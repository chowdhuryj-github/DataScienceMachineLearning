I see the importants of also having the DVD for\nthose of us who might not upgrade the first thing after installation but\nfor those of us who want the most latest versions of the packages it might\ne better to also have a net installation as is with debian.  Will this be\ndone as well as a DVD version?\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
