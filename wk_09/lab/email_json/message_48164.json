Perhaps something similar could be worked out\nhere.  Do you have to get MS Word users to work only with the template you\nprovide, or can they provide you any old MS Word document?\n\nRegards, -Cody\n\nCody Hamilton, PhD\nEdwards Lifesciences\n\nBut sweave is expanding.  There is a driver for HTML sweaving in the\nR2HTML package and the odfWeave package allows you to sweave with open\noffice docs (which can be converted to/from MS word).  I personally like\nusing LaTeX and the original sweave, but I work with people who want\neverything in MS word or similar, so for them I will create a template\nfile in open office, odfWeave that, convert to MS word and send that to\nthem.\n\nI think the offset is more that S-PLUS 8 is supposed to implement many\nof the things that R does now (I don't know which, I'm waiting for my\ncopy of 8), so soon it may be possible to sweave in both.\n\n--\nGregory (Greg) L.
