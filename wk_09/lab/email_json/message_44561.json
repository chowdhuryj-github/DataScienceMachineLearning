The UK does *not* *have* a legal system, as \nlegally it is two kingdoms, each with their constitutionally guaranteed \nseparate legal systems (think of it as if the US congress could pass \nstate laws that applied in one or other state, but could not pass laws \nwhich applied to the entire US as a whole. Weird, I know, but it's the \nsystem we have).\n\nThe UK (yes I know I said we don't have a legal system) is a signatory \nto Berne, which merely guarantees that a foreigner has the same rights \nas the locals. So, as a USian, you can sue in the UK with exactly the \nsame rights as a UK subject would have. Which is why, if as a UKian I \nwant to sue in the US, I have to register my copyright with the Library \nof Congress just like you have to do.\n\nCheers,\nWol\n-- \nAnthony W.
