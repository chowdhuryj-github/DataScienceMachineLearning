(This is shown in the \ntitle in Windows. I forget whether other platforms display it, but it's \nin the return value of open3d()/rgl.open() and rgl.cur().)  You can \nchoose to add more to an existing device using rgl.set().  You can clear \nitems from a device using rgl.clear() or rgl.pop().\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
