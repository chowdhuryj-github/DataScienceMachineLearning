This mail is written to solicit your assistance to be presented as next of kin to my deceased client Mr Ronald Lake. He made a fixed deposit valued of US 10.5M,(Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) on September 1998 for 36 months\nmaturity, with an intent of putting up a gold mining company here in Ghana and upon the maturity this bank started contacting him but to no avail\nOn 31 January, 2004, my client along with his wife died in a plane crash. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site\n(http://www.cnn.com/20003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash)\nThe Governing Board of the bank has contacted me on this matter,based on the fact that his supposed next of kin, happened to die in the said crash and Iam yet to provide any other Next of Kin to lay claim to the fund.\n \nUnder a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the next of Kin,so that the proceeds of this account now valued US 15.1 million,will be paid to you, so that the Bank will not confiscate this fund, as the banking law and guidelines here stipulates\nthat if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund\nFor the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact with me through my private mail box frank_kufor2@excite.com: or phone line:+23323021738,for further information related to this matter.\n \nThank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.\n \nYours faithfully,\nFrank Kufor.\nURGENT REPLY NEEDED\n\n\n"}
