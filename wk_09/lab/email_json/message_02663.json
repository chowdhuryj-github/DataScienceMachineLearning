In the\nmeantime, if anyone has a developement system they wouldn't\nmind providing a temporary account on for a few days, I\ncould probably do it that way.  Root access would not be\nneeded.\n\nRough requirements are as follows.  Machine would have\nDebian etch installed or updated testing with build-deps\nfor linux-2.6 and debian-cd satisfied.\napt-get build-dep linux-2.6 debian-cd\naptitude install initramfs-tools fakeroot subversion\nkernel-wedge\n\nWould probably need a few gb of scratch space for kernel\nbuilds, source etc.  Otherwise, I get to see if 32 bit\nWindows can run 64 bit Linux under an vmware session, eww.\n\nShane\n\n-- \nhttp://www.cm.nu/~shane/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
