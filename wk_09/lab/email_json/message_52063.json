I thought it was a leftover.  Bad Andy for not  \nchecking his assumptions, or even asking.\n\nI updated your fix so that it's \"INLINE\" macroing to \"inline\".   \nOtherwise, I might not be including parrot.h and it'll work for me,  \nbut still fail for you.  This way, INLINE will fail unless we're  \nusing parrot.h\n\n\n\n--\nAndy Lester => andy@petdance.com => www.petdance.com => AIM:petdance\n\n\n\n\n"}
