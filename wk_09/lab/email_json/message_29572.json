A powerful crawler-transporter, carrying Atlantis and its mobile launch platform, is scheduled to begin the 3.2-mile trip from the Vehicle Assembly Building to pad 39A at 4 a.m. Tuesday, weather permitting. The forecast calls for lightning and thunderstorms in the area that could cause problems. More of the same is expected Wednesday.\n\nNASA managers plan to meet May 30 and 31 for a formal flight readiness review to assess the status of ground processing and to set an official launch date. Liftoff currently is targeted for 7:37:56 p.m. on June 8. Assuming Atlantis gets to the pad Tuesday, engineers will have four days of contingency time between then and June 8 to handle any unexpected problems.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
