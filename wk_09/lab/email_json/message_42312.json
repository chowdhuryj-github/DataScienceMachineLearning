My name is Abdul Hakim Zamal a merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate (U.A.E).\n\u00a0\nI have been diagnosed with lung cancer.\u00a0 It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts (I am in a private ward in a private hospital here in the United Kingdom). I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.\n\u00a0\nBut now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\u00a0 I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.\n\u00a0\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I have left for them.\u00a0 The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of $18 Million Dollars that I have with a Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect/receive this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.\n\u00a0\nI will like to inform you that for all your time, effort and sincere honesty you will be given 10% of the funds, this is from the depth of my heart.\n\u00a0\nI'll be awaiting your quick response.\n\u00a0\nWassallam.Abdul Hakim Zamal.\n\u00a0Be one of the first to try Windows Live Mail.
