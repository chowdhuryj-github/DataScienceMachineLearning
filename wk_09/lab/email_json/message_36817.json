I don't understand. The GFDL allows free\nmodification of code (since it's a technical section, can't be\ninvariant), so what's the big deal? Moreover, the document that\ndescribes how to apply GFDL even suggests itself to license code in\nthe manual under the GPL, if this code is substantial (which it rarely\nis; I can't think of a GNU manual that has any considerable amount of\ncode that can't already be extracted and used under the terms of the\nGFDL).\n\nI have strong disagreements with Debian's treatment of the GFDL (and\nit makes us Debianistas look like fundamentalist wackos to the rest of\nthe free software world), but perhaps those are concerns for another\ntime. I just don't see why it's such a problem to have \"software\", as\nDebian calls documentation, with different licenses for intended\ndifferent usages.\n\n- Jordi G.
