The 'skip'\ncommands in read.table, seem to be just for skipping rows, if I understand\nwell, but I need to skip many columns as well. I tried something very simple\nand left one row and one column out, but I don't know how to do it for many\nrows and columns at a time.\n\nExample:\n\nzzz # euclidean distances matrix\n\n      X1   X2   X3   X4   X5\nX1    0   11   12     1   15    \nX2   11    0     5   12     3    \nX3   12    5     0     8     4    \nX4     1  12     8     0   16\nX5   15    3     4    16    0\n\nskip.data = zzz [-3, -3]   #  gives me the same matrix without row 3 and\ncolumn 3... how can I tell R to skip more than one row and column?  Columns\nand rows to be left out are not contiguous  The matrix I'm using is fairly\nlarge (335x335), so excel won't read the whole thing, and it's not a\nfixed-width txt file, so I cannot use read.fwf.  I also don't have access to\nUnix, as was suggested to other users to solve this problem.\n\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Skipping-rows-and-columns-in-large-matrix-tf3712332.html#a10384400\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
