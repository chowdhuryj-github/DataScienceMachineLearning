However, while I have created a (very  \nslow) monte carlo function that so far as I can tell matches their  \nresults, when I attempt to implement their analytic solution it's way  \noff. Can anyone see what I'm doing incorrectly?\n\nn=100\nr=.5 #reliability\ne=.5 #effect size\ndelta=(sqrt(r*n)/2)*e\npower.t.test(n,delta,sig.level=.05,alternative='one.sided')\n\n      Two-sample t test power calculation\n\n               n = 100\n           delta = 1.767767\n              sd = 1\n       sig.level = 0.05\n           power = 1\n     alternative = one.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nMeanwhile, their tables and my monte carlo method say that the power  \nin that circumstance should be .7\n\nHelp?\n\nMike\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
