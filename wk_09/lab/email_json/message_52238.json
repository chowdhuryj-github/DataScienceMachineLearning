Per the timeline, we're ready for you to flip over to deorbit prep back-out.\"\n\nAtlantis has enough on-board supplies to remain in orbit until Sunday, but Knight has decided to bring the shuttle home Friday, at either Kennedy or Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., if the weather permits.\n\n\"The weather forecast for KSC and also what we had given you for Edwards hasn't changed too much for tomorrow so we're going to be fighting the same challenges at KSC,\" Antonelli radioed. \"At Edwards, the winds are going to pick up. So what we've come up with is in about three hours, we're going to do an 11-foot-per second (rocket firing) and what that's going to do for us is pull in an earlier Edwards opportunity and have the potential to get in there before the winds pick up.\"\n\n\"OK, understand if we don't get into KSC tomorrow then you're shooting for Edwards after you get two looks at KSC?\" Sturckow asked.\n\n\"We are, of course, calling up Edwards tomorrow,\" Antonelli said. \"We'll have the first look at KSC and now the second look at KSC will overlap with the first look at Edwards. And of course, after the end of the day we'll have a better look at the Saturday forecast, so we're going to put all that into the equation. But we'll be calling up both KSC and Edwards tomorrow.\"\n\n\"OK, we understand, so tomorrow if you don't get into KSC and the weather is good at Edwards, you intend to go to Edwards. But if the weather is bad at both places, then we'll look at Saturday and see what happens.\"\n\n\"Yeah, if the weather is good at Edwards tomorrow, just like you said, and not at KSC, then we're going to land there,\" Antonelli agreed. \"We are going to try to land tomorrow.\"\n\n\"OK, yep, we understand that,\" Sturckow said. \"Thank you very much, Houston. Sounds like a great game plan.\"\n\nThe astronauts have two landing opportunities in Florida on Friday - at 2:18 p.m. and 3:54 p.m. - and, with the rocket firing later today, three at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\n\nHere is an updated list of all available landing opportunities Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Kennedy (KSC), Edwards (EDW) and White Sands Space Harbor, N.M. (NOR). This list includes the additional Edwards opportunity Friday that was discussed by Antonelli (all times in EDT and subject to change):\n\nDAY...EDT.......DD...HH...MM...EVENT\n\n06/22/07\nFri\u00a0 01:16 PM...13...17...38...KSC: Deorbit on rev 218\nFri\u00a0 02:18 PM...13...18...40...KSC: Landing\nFri\u00a0 02:46 PM...13...19...08...EDW: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:49 PM...13...20...11...EDW: Landing\nFri\u00a0 02:52 PM...13...19...14...KSC: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:54 PM...13...20...16...KSC: Landing\nFri\u00a0 04:21 PM...13...20...43...EDW: Deorbit on rev 220\nFri\u00a0 05:24 PM...13...21...46...EDW: Landing\nFri\u00a0 05:58 PM...13...22...20...EDW: Deorbit on rev 221\nFri\u00a0 06:59 PM...13...23...21...EDW: Landing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n06/23/07\nSat\u00a0 11:59 AM...14...16...21...KSC: Deorbit on rev 233\nSat\u00a0 01:02 PM...14...17...24...KSC: Landing\nSat\u00a0 01:31 PM...14...17...53...NOR: Deorbit on rev 234\nSat\u00a0 02:33 PM...14...18...55...NOR: Landing\nSat\u00a0 01:35 PM...14...17...57...KSC: Deorbit on rev 234\nSat\u00a0 02:37 PM...14...18...59...KSC: Landing\nSat\u00a0 03:05 PM...14...19...27...EDW: Deorbit on rev 235\nSat\u00a0 04:07 PM...14...20...29...EDW: Landing\nSat\u00a0 03:06 PM...14...19...28...NOR: Deorbit on rev 235\nSat\u00a0 04:08 PM...14...20...30...NOR: Landing\nSat\u00a0 04:40 PM...14...21...02...EDW: Deorbit on rev 236\nSat\u00a0 05:42 PM...14...22...04...EDW: Landing\nSat\u00a0 04:43 PM...14...21...05...NOR: Deorbit on rev 236\nSat\u00a0 05:44 PM...14...22...06...NOR: Landing\n\n06/24/07\nSun\u00a0 12:20 PM...15...16...42...KSC: Deorbit on rev 249\nSun\u00a0 01:22 PM...15...17...44...KSC: Landing\nSun\u00a0 01:52 PM...15...18...14...NOR: Deorbit on rev 250\nSun\u00a0 02:54 PM...15...19...16...NOR: Landing\nSun\u00a0 01:56 PM...15...18...18...KSC: Deorbit on rev 250\nSun\u00a0 02:58 PM...15...19...20...KSC: Landing\nSun\u00a0 03:26 PM...15...19...48...EDW: Deorbit on rev 251\nSun\u00a0 04:27 PM...15...20...49...EDW: Landing\nSun\u00a0 03:28 PM...15...19...50...NOR: Deorbit on rev 251\nSun\u00a0 04:27 PM...15...20...49...NOR: Landing\nSun\u00a0 05:02 PM...15...21...24...EDW: Deorbit on rev 252\nSun\u00a0 06:03 PM...15...22...25...EDW: Landing\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
