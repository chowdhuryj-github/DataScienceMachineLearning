You have three\nthings that can be iterated over.  You can iterate over all three like\nthis:\n\nfor my $k (sort keys %$ref) {\n        for my $i (0 .. $#{$ref->{$k}}) {\n                for my $k2 (sort keys %{$ref->{$k}[$i]}) {\n                        print \"$k:$i:$k2 is $ref->{$k}[$i]{$k2}\\n\";\n                }\n        }\n}\n\nHowever, I bet you want to iterator over all of the contents of the\nRejectRecord key like this\n\nmy $max = @{$ref->{RejectRecord}};\nfor my $i (1 .. $max) {\n    print \"record $i of $max failed because\n$ref->{RejectRecord}[$i-1]{Reason}\\n\";\n}\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
