I guess that's because\nI don't usually use oldconfig. Since having the right config\nis the most important part of the kernel build, I always do\nit from scratch, with only the new source tree and nothing\nold in there. Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment. hehe.\n\nBut for those who haven't compiled kernel, it's really \nnot that hard. Like most things, there's only one way to\nlearn, by screwing up a few times and making kernels\nthat won't boot, and learning how to recover from that,\nlearning by trial and error what some of those drivers \nare and are not. I also highly recommend doing the \nlinuxfromscratch thing if you have the time and patience.\nIt's quite satisfying to build the entire mess from source\nand gives you a much better understanding of the \nfundamentals of linux.\n \nWhen I first started using linux I had this constant fear\nof  missing stuff, if I didn't have everything installed then\nI wouldn't be able to build or use xyz software later. \nNow I'm the opposite, I always want a minimal system,\nonly what I need and nothing more. Some of these \ndistros have 6GB of software on the disks. Insane.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
