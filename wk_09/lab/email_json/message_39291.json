I know that you can use speakup in gentoo with a external \nsynth, but, is there support using software speach? Guess it's really \nnot needed as you can do most of it through ssh, but, figured I would \nask. I did a search on google for software speach in gentoo and only \nfound things from a few years ago. Either I did not search enough, \nor, it was not there. Any ideas would be great.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
