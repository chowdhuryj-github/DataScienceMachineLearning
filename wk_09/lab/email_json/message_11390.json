The Hygeia mobile application allows nursing professionals to manage scheduled shifts as well as bid on available shifts through portable devices. The components for this application are currently in development through the TopCoder, Inc. component competitions. A bonus is offered for integrating these components in place of the stubs required for this competition.\n\nThe winning team will be paid $3,000, and the second place team will be paid $1,500. \n\nMore details are available here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&pj=30001462\n\nAssembly Competitions are team-based competitions to integrate completed components from the TopCoder catalog into full-blown applications. If you are interested in joining either a team or the review board, or would like more information on the competition process, send us an email at AssemblyCompetitions@topcoder.com.\nGood luck!\n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
