Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, flight engineer Oleg Kotov and Williams immediately began working through emergency procedures.\n\nMoments later, astronaut Clay Anderson, Williams' replacement, called Houston to say the crew had \"looked around, we smelled around\" and there was no sign of any smoke or fire.\n\n\"ISS, we copy,\" McArthur said. \"No evidence of visible smoke or fire and you think all is normal but you're still checking. We're standing by.\"\n\n\"We're working some recovery steps,\" Anderson said. \"But it appears to be a software glitch. There is no fire.\"\n\nA few moments later, Russian flight controllers agreed it was a false alarm.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
