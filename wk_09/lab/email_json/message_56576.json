I\njust wanted to calcluate the time it takes to run my program. Basically I\nwas to put a timer at the start and the end of the program in order to see\nhow much time it takes to give the output (similar to tic-tac in MATLAB) .\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nSuman\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
