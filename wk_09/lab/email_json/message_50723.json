We closed\n> our doors tempporarily as a result, and spent the last week debugging\n> these problems. We believe we have them well solved. Consequently, it is\n> once again possible to purchase and download TTSynth.\n>\n> http://TTSynth.Com\n>\n> Of course we also provided packages through email to those few customers\n> who experienced problems with our initial release. We believe there are\n> now no outstanding issues.\n>\n> Specifically, we had two problems to fix in our automated download \n> process:\n>\n> 1.) Customers using Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows were\n> unable to complete transactions. This is now fixed.\n>\n> 2.) Some customers using Debian or Ubuntu experienced failures due\n> to a bug we uncovered in the earlier version of GNU TLS used on these\n> two distributions. Of course it is very important that your Internet\n> transaction is properly protected by SSL. This is now also fixed.\n>\n> Consequently, the premier Text To Speech (TTS) software synthesizer for\n> Linux is once again available for immediate secure on line purchase and\n> download using a credit card!\n>\n> Available Modules Include:\n>     * IBM's incomparable IBM TTS text to speech (formerly called\n>       ViaVoice)\n>     * Gnome-Speech patched for use with LSR and Orca\n>     * The TTSynth Speakup Bridge for screen reading with Speakup\n>     * ttsynth_say binary for the CLI or for use in scripts\n>     * Also supported by Emacspeak KTTS, and Speech Dispatcher\n>\n> Available Languages For Linux\n>     * Chinese\n>     * English\n>     * Finnish\n>     * French\n>     * German\n>     * Italian\n>     * Japanese\n>     * Portuguese\n>     * Spanish\n>\n>   The best is also very affordable.
