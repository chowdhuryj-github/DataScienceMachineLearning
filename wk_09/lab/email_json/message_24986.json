It apparently dozes while cruising at 25 mph. \n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS \n      EVENING NEWSHere is an early preview of what we \n      are planning for tonight\u2019s CBS EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing \n      Editor, Katie Couric\u2026 Hi everyone, After the town \n      of Greensburg, Kansas, was reduced to little more than rubble over the \n      weekend, a survivor was found in the wreckage today \u2013 bringing some good \n      news to the grim story. Hari Sreenivasan will have our report on \n      the aftermath from Greensburg. When a disaster like this massive \n      tornado strikes, the National Guard is often called upon to help citizens \n      piece together broken lives. But during wartime, the guard isn\u2019t always \n      there in full force, David Martin will report. Reports said \n      the tornado was more than a mile wide and it was a whopping F-5 storm \u2013 \n      the classification for the very strongest twisters. What\u2019s behind such a \n      monster tornado? Cynthia Bowers will have the story from a storm \n      prediction center in Norman, Oklahoma. In business news, prices at \n      the gas pump surged over the weekend, reaching $4.00 per gallon in some \n      places. Anthony Mason will have the reasons behind the pump price \n      spike. Yesterday French voters elected Nicholas Sarkozy, the \n      pro-American conservative candidate, in a close election that had a huge \n      turnout. But would the French candidates\u2019 personal lives horrify American \n      voters? Jeff Greenfield will take a look at what American voters \n      can learn from some of the culture behind France\u2019s election. And \n      correspondent John Blackstone reports on what some are calling an \n      agricultural emergency in the United States: the sudden disappearance of \n      honeybees. The die-off has hit 27 states \u2013 and with about 30 percent of \n      the nation\u2019s food supply being pollinated by bees, the risk is great and \n      scientists are scrambling to nail down the cause. We\u2019ll have the story in \n      a segment we\u2019re calling Saving the World. Finally, it was a \n      day of much pomp and fanfare at the White House, as Queen Elizabeth II was \n      welcomed to Washington. President Bush tonight is hosting the first \n      white-tie dinner of his presidency in honor of the queen. Mark \n      Phillips will share details of Elizabeth\u2019s elegant day inside the \n      beltway. I hope you\u2019ll join us.
