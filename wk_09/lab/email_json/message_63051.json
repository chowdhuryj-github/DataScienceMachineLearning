Similarly, if this is possible, can I then provide this package\na vector of distances from each point to an arbitrary unknown location (in\nmy example, this would be a 1x10 vector) and apply the model to this vector\nto predict a single unknown point?  It seems most (if not all) of the\nkriging packages I'm finding for R take the x,y,z location as the inputs and\ncalculate these distances themselves.
