Same goes for tests\nthat only require a dc.\n\nAlso, the current code makes it very easy to add support for other\ntargets (Samba3, for example) that don't support all test environments\n(yet).\n\nPerhaps you would simply like to make sure that all test environments\nare set up in 'make testenv' ?\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niQCVAwUBRjWUwwy0JeEGD2blAQItcgQAlfTybfTBfQeZ4cdmnUYHsN5UXyHyk6at\neNfqSIjqwbyJuMapaquZ2Eb+SZI95ACztHE5YnujZY7CbNefr3TwMMrT9gJhPzCl\nnFUyOqdehTlE8Es+AMmkZWvDtJxXFwY07qejR4VAvKHkzKc+LyAuClCdWWuUYP8r\n5vu3OYypfR4=\n=mUbm\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
