Despite this unfortunate fact,\nand despite some unfortunate resulting issues we cannot ourselves\nreadily address, it remains the most asked for computer voice. You may\nknow this voice by some of its other tradenames, such as Viavoice or\nEloquence. The core code is the same in all of these.\n\nFurthermore, our docs clearly state this. I don't understand your point,\ntherefore.\n\nJanina\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
