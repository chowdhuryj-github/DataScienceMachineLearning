If x and y are factors, doing c(x,y) appears\nto coerce x and y to numeric mode before catenating them.  So what does one\ndo if one wants the result to be a factor whose levels are the union of the\nlevels of x and y?  I vaguely recall seeing this discussed in r-help, but I\ncan't find anything on it there, nor in the FAQ.\n\nAm I missing something obvious?\n\n                    cheers,\n\n                        Rolf\n                        r.turner@auckland.ac.nz\n\n\n\n\n######################################################################\nAttention:\\ This e-mail message is privileged and confidenti...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
