Not to mention, everything you need for the execution of  \nthe program is compiled into the exe file, so there's no need to hope  \nthe folks have the proper dlls on their systems.\nAnd, they're still supporting, upgrading, and creating new versions of  \ntheir tools.\nThey even still sell powerbasic for dos.\nNow, how's that for support.\nIn fact, pb for dos was just upgraded to version 4.0 (from 3.5) only a  \nyear or two back.\n\n\nOn Jun 22, 2007, at 1:22 AM, Gregory Nowak wrote:\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> How did you go about learning the windows api?
