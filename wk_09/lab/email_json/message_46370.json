The\nscapegoat of the year may turn out to be famed bond manager Bill Gross,\nwho opened his mouth last week to opine that inflation was coming back. \nBut it's really not Bill's fault.  We've had a super three-month run, and\nnow the investing business is going to get a little harder.  More details\non this in the letter below from Mike Cintolo. But first I want to let you\nknow that Cabot is looking for new talent, particularly on the editorial\nside.  If you're passionate about investing, and you'd like to share your\nexpertise with the world, I'd like to hear from you.  By email, of course.\n And now, on to Mike. \n\nTimothy Lutts, TimothyLutts@cabotwealth.com\n\n-----\n\nInflation!!!  Run for the hills!!!  Ahhhh!!!\n\nThat, in short, was the story of the stock and bond markets from last\nweek.  As Tim mentioned above, whiz Pimco bond fund manager Bill Gross\nopined early in the week that he shifted to a bearish long-term view of\nbonds, believing inflation is going to pick up and drive interest rates\nhigher.  That, in part, caused a big bond market sell-off, a huge increase\nin long-term interest rates, and of course, a plunging stock market from\nTuesday through Thursday.\n\nBut wait!  In an interview on CNBC Friday, Mr. Gross said that while\nlong-term rates might get as high as 6 1/2% over the next three to five\nyears (who can see that far in the future??), he believes short-term rates\nare likely to hold where they are ... or even move lower in the near term!\n So which one is it?  I realize the bond market has many different moving\nparts, but one day he's talking about inflation and a bear market in\nbonds, and the next, he's talking about the opposite.\n\n(Incidentally, this kind of back-and-forth talk reminds me of Alan\nGreenspan's comments from February, which I wrote about in the Wealth\nAdvisory, when he was talking about recession probabilities.  And not\nsurprisingly, Pimco's has hired Greenspan as a consultant!)\n\nIn any case, I am proud NOT to be an economist, so I'm not going to bore\nyou with any GDP forecasts or trade deficit chatter.  But the comings and\ngoings of last week bring two points to the fore.\n\nFirst, as good as Bill Gross is, he's just one guy.  Instead of relying on\nopinions, I prefer to look at facts.  The only two pieces of economic data\nI check regularly come from the Economic Cycle Research Institute.  Their\noriginal founder, Geoffrey Moore, came up with the Leading Economic\nIndicators, which are still reported monthly by the government.  But\ninstead of resting on his laurels, he founded the ECRI, which has a great\ntrack record of calling turns in the economy, and in inflation.  \n\nThe company's Future Inflation Gauge is its key, well, inflation gauge. \nAnd for the past few months, it's been skidding sharply!  In the press\nrelease for the last report, managing director Lakshman Achuthan said,\n\"With the U.S. Future Inflation Gauge in a cyclical downtrend, U.S.\ninflation is not a serious concern at this time.\"  \n\nSo why has the yield on the ten-year Treasury note jumped from 4.6% in\nmid-May to more than 5.1% today?  Because economic growth is going to\naccelerate!  ECRI publishes a Weekly Leading Index, which combines a bunch\nof factors to give you an up-to-date glance at what the economy will be\ndoing a few months from now.  During the last couple of months, the Index\nhas been pushing higher, with the growth rate of the Index at multi-year\npeaks.  Translation:  We're likely to see a good growth spurt during the\nnext six months.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean the stock market can't go down for a bit.  A month\nago, I wrote about my hunch that we were near \"the end of the beginning\"\nof this bull market.  In my mind, the Bill Gross \"news\" simply served as\nan excuse for investors to book profits after a heady three-month advance.\n So maybe we're in for a summer trading range, with some exciting ups and\nsome depressing downs.  But the longer-term positives that were in place\n(9-to-1 up days in March, record high NYSE short interest, Presidential\nElection Cycle, etc.) are still there, so the odds remain in favor of\nhigher prices looking out a few months ... if not before.\n\n-----\n\nAs Editor of Cabot Top Ten Report, our weekly publication that offers\nsubscribers a constant source of top-notch stock ideas, I come across\ninvestors of all types.  Most, like me, are intermediate-term in nature;\nthey generally look to get into a powerfully uptrending stock, hold on for\ntwo to four months, and then get out when the stock begins to show signs\nof wear and tear.  Some are longer-term than that, willing to ride through\na stock's periodic 25% to 30% corrections (or base building periods,\ndepending how you look at it) in an effort to build huge gains.\n\nBut many Top Ten subscribers are also shorter-term, swing-type traders\nlooking to buy a good stock at the right time, and then cash out within\ntwo or three weeks.  Even if most investors aren't short-term with their\nentire portfolio, more and more do some swing trading as part of their\nsystem.\n\nGiven this, and given my love of market timing, and given the new\nProShares (index funds that trade like stocks and move twice the index, up\nor down), I've done a bit of research on shorter-term market timing. \nHere's one thing I found that you'll be able to use to make money.\n\nIt starts with the RSI indicator, which is available with just about every\ncharting system.  The RSI is a typical overbought/oversold indicator - it\nranges between 0 and 100, and if you're below 30, you're typically\noversold; above 70, overbought.  The default settings use a 14-day RSI. \nNow, I'm not a huge fan of most overbought/oversold indicators, but the\nRSI is pretty good.  It's really the only one I follow.\n\nThis might all sound a bit complicated, but it's definitely not.  If you\nuse charts at all, you should be able to call up the RSI with ease.  \n\nAs it turns out, using the RSI for shorter time periods works, too.  In\nfact, I tested the 2-day RSI (it moves up and down very quickly), and\nfound some exciting results.  For instance, since the start of 2003, if\nthe 2-day RSI for the S&P 500 dips below 15 (it usually does so fifteen or\ntwenty times a year), the S&P 500 is up 0.46% five trading days later,\nnearly double the random return.  Even better, if the 2-day RSI closes\nbelow 15 for two straight days (FYI, it did so this past Thursday), the\nS&P 500 is up 0.74% a week later.  And if you go back further in time, say\nto 1995, the results actually improve.\n\nWant more?  Well, the 3-day RSI also provides interesting results.  If the\n3-day RSI for the S&P 500 finishes a day below 20, then the index is up\n0.65% a week later; two straight days below 20, and it's up 0.82% a week\nlater!  That might not sound like much, but 0.82% per week annualizes to a\n49% return; clearly a market-beating result.  All of these results assume\nthe S&P is above its long-term 200-day moving average - making sure you're\nin a general bull trend.\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking.  \"Mike, nice numbers and all,\nbut how am I going to make any sort of winnings by cranking out fractions\nof a percent?\"  Well, first, with the new leveraged ProShares and the\nright RSI system, you could make some good money trading fifteen or twenty\ntimes per year.  \n\nBut, second, for the way I trade, these RSI readings can be of use when\npurchasing individual stocks ... helping you to buy at proper times.  All\nthings equal, it's going to help if you buy a leading stock when the\nmarket itself is oversold (i.e., when the 2-day or 3-day RSI readings are\nvery low) and likely to bounce in the days ahead.  You're more likely to\nget off to a good start, which is always important.  So keep an eye on\nthese RSI indicators going ahead; they've proven a big help to me, and\ntheir records suggest they should continue to help in the future.\n\n----- Advertisement -----\n\nHow to Invest Safer, Smarter and Better\n\nMarket timing gets little attention when the market is heading ever\nhigher, but now that a splash of cold water has hit investors in the face,\nmany are remembering that Wall Street is not a one-way street.\n\nSo if you're looking for a time-tested, award-winning system -- as well as\ncoverage on our Two-Second and Volume Blast-Off Indicators -- consider\ngiving the Cabot Market Letter a look. We not only tell you the market's\ncurrent condition, but we'll use that to get you into (and eventually out\nof) the market's best stocks via our concentrated Model Portfolio.\n\nYou could easily see a $10,000 investment mushroom into $15,000 in six\nmonths...into $20,000 in a year...into $35,000 in 18 months.\n\nTo learn more please visit this link:\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/196102/13148861/78/0/\n\n-----\n\nSo now I've written about an economic tool, and a short-term trading tool.\n How about something for picking winning stocks?  I've got one of those,\ntoo!\n\nAt Cabot, we've collected a few criteria that have helped us nail down\nsome big winners of yesteryear.  Tim has mentioned many of these before: \nInnovative management, revolutionary product or service, a huge mass\nmarket, and more.  Well, a couple of years ago, I suggested testing a\nsimple criteria - triple-digit revenue growth.  It's turned out to be one\nof our most reliable criteria!\n\nSurely, 100%+ revenue growth is not a new concept when looking for growth\nstocks.  But we know of few investors who specifically screen for and\nsearch for stocks that are growing revenues at this type of pace.  Most\nbelieve it's a positive thing ... but when they examine a stock growing\nthat fast, they usually end up finding reasons to avoid buying (too-high\nvaluation, a potential fad product, competitive pressures, etc.).  Our\nstudies show that these fast growers don't always work, but when they do,\nthey can be really big winners.\n\nOne triple-digit grower that's been on my radar screen:  Riverbed\nTechnology (RVBD), which is the full-fledged leader in the new wide-area\nnetwork (WAN) optimization networking market.  It's a great story!  Here's\nwhat I had to write about it in Cabot Top Ten Report back on May 21:\n\n\"In recent years, most firms' work places have become more and more spread\nout - employees are able to travel anywhere and still submit work thanks\nto the Internet - and yet the major applications corporations run are\nbeing centralized on the firm's servers. The result is lots of latency\n(time for the data to travel back and forth to the worker) and chattiness\n(interactions between dozens of servers, networks, etc.) - and a slow\nnetwork. The market's hungry for a solution ... and Riverbed has it! The\ncompany's Steelhead appliance can boost speeds from five- to fifty-fold,\nand better yet, is miles ahead of the competition; management says it has\nan 18-24 month technology lead, and the firm's triple-digit revenue growth\nand a history of big wins (in the fourth quarter, it won orders on 98 of\nthe 105 jobs in which it competed against Cisco!) confirms it. Bottom\nline, this is a whole new networking field, and Riverbed is the leader.\"\n\nRiverbed's revenues have grown 247%, 219% and 212% the past three\nquarters; that's decelerating slightly, but is still lightning-fast\ngrowth.  Earnings are also booming, up from a loss of $0.02 per share, to\na profit of $0.03, to a profit of $0.12 the past three quarters.  \n\nThe stock is also acting very well.  The stock rose from 39 in that issue\nof Top Ten to as high as 43 before the market yanked it lower last week. \nBut what I liked is how RVBD barely gave up ground (it held above 40),\nwhile volume rolled below-average every day last week.  Clearly, few big\ninvestors are dumping shares of this networking firm, as they anticipate\nmore stunning results to come.  I think RVBD is a \"buy a little\" situation\naround these levels, with the idea of buying more should the stock and\nmarket cooperate in the weeks to come.\n\nThat's it for this time.  As always, I welcome all questions and comments\nat mike@cabotwealth.com.
