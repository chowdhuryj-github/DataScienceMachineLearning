So, it's time to do it with \nPerl. I need just a short tip to start out: which structure to use to \ncount all possible occurrences between letters (e.g. A, B and C) under \nthe particular document number. My dataset looks like following:\n\n1 A\n1 B\n1 C\n1 B\n2 A\n2 A\n2 B\n2 C\netc. till doc. number 100.000\n\nThe result file should than be similar to:\nA B 4   ### 2 co-occurrences under doc. number 1 + 2 co-occurrences \nunder doc. number 2\nA C 3   ### 1 co-occurrence under doc. number 1 + 2 co-occurrences under \ndoc. number 2\nB C 3   ### 2 co-occurrences under doc. number 1 + 1 co-occurrence under \ndoc. number 2\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers.\n\nBest, Andrej\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
