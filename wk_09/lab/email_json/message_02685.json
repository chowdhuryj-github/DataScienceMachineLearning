To my knowledge there is no\ndirect replacement for dialog in Perl.  You can always call dialog\nwith qx() or `` operators.  If your desire is to have a GUI for your\nPerl program then there are several toolkits that give you much more\ncontrol than dialog ever could, but at a cost in terms of complexity:\nGtk2*, Tk*, Wx*, Win32*, etc.  I am partial to Gtk2 (especially when\nused in conjunction with Gtk2::GladeXML*).\n\n>\n> I produce a software in shell-script that create new\n> databases in postgresql, define IP Address, Port\n> Number, set permissions, test versions, replace fields\n> and others.
