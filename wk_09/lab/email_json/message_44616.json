I wouldn't want either. I want to use a copyright agreementthat would allow non-commercial use, with attribution and free distribution \nof the document.The problem is, I want this copy of the document to be archived in the UMI repository, and I will be paying them to do it. Moreover, they get subscription moneyfrom libraries to access the archive. So that is how it works, now. I pay them money\nfor them to make more money, and not helping me with a proper copyright agreementof my own choice (from Creative Commons ofcourse).I had written to the UMI but Im being\u00a0 jerked around from one place to another. My\nschool doesnt really care; I want the UMI to host the document in open-access, butunder a copyright agreement of my choice.Any and all help is appreciated.Thanks,Muthu\n"}
