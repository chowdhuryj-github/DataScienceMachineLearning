I installed cvs and checked the \nmanual, but I cannot figure out how to download a certain program; the \nmanual answers questions I never asked.\nSo can someone please point me to the right direction?\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
