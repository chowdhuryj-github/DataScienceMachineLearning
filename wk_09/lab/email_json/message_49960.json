The \nsecond line looks like the input line that the first line is expecting, \nand if you remove the empty line, you will see that pos_name has been \nassigned the text of the second line.\n\nIf you put these lines into a text file and then use \"source\" to read \nit, it works as I think you expect.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
