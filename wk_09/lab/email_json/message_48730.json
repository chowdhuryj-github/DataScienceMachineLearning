You are only\ncovered by clause 3c when you have received the promise for source code\nas of 3b. But since Debian offers you access to copy the source code by\nthe same designated place as the binary you copied, it has distributed\nyou the source code as of 3a.\n\nSome people usually mirror only binaries and they are distributing as of\n3b. I still usually recommend these people to include sources. If they\ndo not have enough storage, they should remove some binaries. This way\nthey are protected.\n\nThat is the same recommendation you and some other people just did to\nthis case. If you can't provide source code whithin three years of last\ndistributing the binaries, you are in a bad situation.\n\n> Cheers,\n> Wol\n> -- \n> Anthony W.
