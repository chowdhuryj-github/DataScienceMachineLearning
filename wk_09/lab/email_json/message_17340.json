Have you tried to give the installer a static net address?  Sometimes\nolder, slower hardware can give a problem with dhcp.\n\nAlso, for grins, take a look at your /dev/ directory and see if anything's\nchanging when you modprobe i82365. (just curious).\n\nAnd, lastly, where did you find this thing?  I want one.  Be a great\nfirewall/router/California server...\n\nCiao,\n\nDave\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
