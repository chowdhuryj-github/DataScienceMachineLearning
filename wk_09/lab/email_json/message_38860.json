The study's authors acknowledge the figure understates the anti-terrorism effort by the        Homeland Security Department's immigration agencies.\n\nIn addition, because no one knows how many terrorists are in the United States or tried to get in, there is no way to say whether the figure of 12 is too low, too high or about right.\n\n\"The right number is unknowable,\" co-author David Burnham said in an interview. \"But the budget and powers of this agency are influenced by all their talk and rhetoric about terrorism and criminals and if that isn't what they are doing, it should be considered by Congress and the public.\"\n\nHomeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said the study failed to appreciate record-setting enforcement totals.\n\n\"They seem not to grasp that immigration laws are a powerful authority in preventing security risks from setting foot on our soil,\" Knocke said. \"The vast majority of immigration violations are either going to be criminals or economic migrants who arrive illegally, but we're tough for that off-chance one presents a national security concern.\"\n\nTerrorists have been barred, Knocke said, and new tools to help are going into place. That includes getting data on travelers well before they arrive and improving security of travel documents.\n\n--!>              \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
