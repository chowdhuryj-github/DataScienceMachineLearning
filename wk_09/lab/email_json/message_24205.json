Currently I'm trying to access and log in to \nOrkut,\nwww.orkut.com\n\nAt the first page, I cannot find the form fields to put my e-mail and \npassword.\n\nI have succeeded accessing Orkut with Edbrowse web browser. Using Edbrowse, \nI discovered that to enable the form fields, I must access a link called \n\"login\" that's in a frame, but in ELinks I don't know what keys to press to \nland in frames, form fields, etc.\n\nThanks,\nCleverson\n\n\"Be realistic; ask for the impossible.\" \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
