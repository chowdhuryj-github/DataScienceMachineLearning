I am a Java  & \nMatlab user, so I assume that it  wouldn't be a hurdle.  Where do I get \nto see the source codes for R  sub-packages  ? I looked at those \nsub-packages in folder  'R-ex'  for the source codes and they are \ncompressed files.  Do I mean to de-compress these files where the source \ncodes reside ?\n\nAny hint would be useful.\n\nCheers,\nSione.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
