This may be just my ignorance\nabout naming conventions inside loops and subsets, but the following\nappears like a bug to me.\n\n\ny = c( 1963, 1963, 1964, 1964, 1965, 1965 );\nr1= rnorm(6);\nd= data.frame ( y=y, r1=r1 );\n\n## note: I am not attach()ing anything anywhere\n\n## this should give me two results, which it does\nahw.y= subset(d, d$y==1963); print(summary(ahw.y));\n\n\n## this should give me the same two results, which it does not.  All 6\nare included now.\nfor (y in 1963:1963) {\n  subd= subset(d, d$y==y);\n  print(summary(subd));\n}\n\n## this should give me the same two results, which it does\nfor (yr in 1963:1963) {\n  subd= subset(d, d$y==yr);\n  print(summary(subd));\n}\n\n\nhope this helps.
