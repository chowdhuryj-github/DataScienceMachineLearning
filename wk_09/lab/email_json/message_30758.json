A@Dim <- c(as.integer(9),as.integer(6)) does not produce a column ordering result, which I am assuming is because the data is stored in a row (i) and column (j) format instead (class dgTMatrix)\n\nYou should not have manipulate slots of S4 classes in general.\nSome  people say that you should not even access them directly.\n\n    Scott> Does a function for this exist?\n\nyes, as I said above  dim(.) <- ..  works in the newest versions\nof \"Matrix\".\n\nRegards,\nMartin Maechler, ETH Zurich\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
