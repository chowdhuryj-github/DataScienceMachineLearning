These data consists of signed and directed graphs.\n\nApart from the programs I write myself, I am looking for R functions \nfor computing what at that time was called \"Structural Balance\", \nmainly to check on my own programs, where the results are almost to \ngood to be true.  I want to limit myself to cycles (semicycles?) of \nlength two and three.\n\nI am aware of the \"network\" package as well as the \"sna\" which do not \nseem to quite cover what I need.  On the other hand, the terminology \nmay have changed since I looked into the field 40 years ago.  I am \nalso aware of the Pajek program and the corresponding book by Nooy, \nMrvrar, and Batagelj.\n\nAny other suggestions or pointers?\n\nTom\n-- \n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Tom Backer Johnsen, Psychometrics Unit,  Faculty of Psychology |\n| University of Bergen, Christies gt. 12, N-5015 Bergen,  NORWAY |\n| Tel : +47-5558-9185                        Fax : +47-5558-9879 |\n| Email : backer@psych.uib.no    URL : http://www.galton.uib.no/ |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
