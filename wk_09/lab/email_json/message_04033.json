Also continue\nthe d-i, gnome, kde, xfce, splash graphics integration.\n(thanks also to andre for the more blue theme) \n> \n> * live!

Live cd's (from debian-live) seem to be easy to create, so we\ncould have a set of the to show what we want. For instance, this was\ntalked in -devel about show development tools  for linux/debian.\n\n> \n> * ltsp: We need to work to make sure that the installer will contain a\n> polished ltsp-client-builder udeb and the user will be able to select\n> \"desktop environment\" and \"thin(fat, whatever) client server\" and end\n> with a system able to provide our desktop environment for these\n> clients.

I don't really say that it should be too diferent\nfrom the main desktop task, but have libpam-ldap and other productivity\ntools.\n\nAlso a ldap server task should be added to perform the server side.\n\nI really think debian has a few cards to show in enterprises, so let's\nget it better.\n\n> \n> * menu system: The Debian menu system needs to be reviewed for both\n> GNOME, KDE, Xfce usage and what to do to not break others WMs.\n> \n> * website and wiki: I need help with wiki articles general cleanup and\n> website maintenance.
