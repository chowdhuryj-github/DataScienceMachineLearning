It is the replacement for the built-in\nformat engine of Perl 5.  Your code would look something like:\n\nprint \"$cust\\nTicket ID                      Subject\n  hh:mm\\n\", '-' x 65, \"\\n\";\nfor my $tkt (@tkts) {\n    print form\n        \"{>>>>>>}   {[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[} {>>}:{>>}\",\n        @{$tkt}{qw/id messafe hour minute/};\n}\n\n* http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Perl6-Form-0.04/Form.pm\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
