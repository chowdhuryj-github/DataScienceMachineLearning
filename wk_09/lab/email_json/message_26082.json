The first are patient that returns to take drugs and the\nlatter are patient  that ends the treatment because they don't want to\ntake drugs anymore. The two curves are obviously mixed as in this\nfigure\n\n\n*\n*\n**\n***                ****\n****          **********\n**********************\n\nWhat survival model can i apply? I think kaplan meyer and cox are\ntight to models described by only one distribution and i don't know\nother R modules that let me do other type of analysis...\n\nany suggestion?\n\nthanks and sorry for my english,\n  nelson\n\n\n\n-- \n--\nConsulenze Linux e Windows\n\nhttp://nelsonenterprise.net\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
