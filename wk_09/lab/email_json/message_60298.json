Is there some automatic way of getting it? Since I\nhave many inequalities as constraints (all linear), it is quite\ndifficult to find a feasible value. I have tried to use rgenoud\nsolution as a feasible value, but rgenoud seems not being converging.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
