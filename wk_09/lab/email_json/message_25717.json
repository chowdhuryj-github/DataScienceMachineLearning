RPM from a later version of RHEL?  Compiled from\nsource?\n\nLong answer: If you have a valid backup, restore your system.  If you\ndon't then try reinstalling the original RPMs from RHEL and see if you\ncan get things up and running again.  Once you are up and running\ndownload Perl 5.8.8 and install it into a different directory than the\nstock version (/opt/perl5.8.8 for instance).  Change the code that is\nusing spamassassin to have #! lines that point to\n/opt/perl5.8.8/bin/perl instead of /usr/bin/perl.  Or, you can upgrade\nto RHEL5 which already has perl 5.8.8.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
