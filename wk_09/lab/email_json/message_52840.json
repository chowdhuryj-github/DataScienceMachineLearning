Any suggestions?\n\nIt would not be easy to do this.  Neither lme nor lmer were designed\nto make this easy to do.  There is a better chance of accomplishing\nthis by creating a custom function based on the current lmer but the\nmodifications required are non-trivial.\n\nThis is a reasonable thing to want to accomplish and I will add it to\nthe \"To Do\" list for lmer.  However it is not something I will be able\nto get to soon.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
