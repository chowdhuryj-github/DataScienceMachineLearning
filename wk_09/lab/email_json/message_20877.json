I assume that nnet still applies the\nlogistic function as the activation function for the nodes in the hidden\nlayer, but I also assume another activation function must be applied at the\noutput layer in order to return the predictions to the linear scale. I am\nnot able to figure out what is happening from the documentation, could\nanyone provide more details about what nnet does at the output layer?\n\nbest,\n\nSpencer\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
