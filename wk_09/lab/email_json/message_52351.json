Is the air\n  you\u2019re breathing clean enough? Research has shown that high ozone\n  levels can have lethal consequences, so the EPA is proposing tightening smog\n  standards. Wyatt Andrews will have the story tonight.\n\u00a0\nSome of those most affected by high ozone levels are\n  the country's children \u2014 especially those who live close to major\n  highways. John Blackstone will take us inside a children's hospital in San Francisco to look at the impact of living in one of America's\n  smoggiest cities.\n\u00a0\nTurning our attention to Iraq,\n  the U.S.\n  military announced the deaths of 14 soldiers and Marines over the past two\n  days. Five soldiers were killed in one roadside bomb attack in northeastern Baghdad. David Martin\n  will have the latest on what the Pentagon says about how the surge is\n  progressing.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a new experimental treatment for\n  Parkinson\u2019s that shows promise for some patients. Michelle Miller will\n  have the details.\n\u00a0\nLike Michael Moore\u2019s other controversial\n  films, \u201cSicko\u201d drew a huge crowd at its premiere and is getting\n  lots of attention from the entertainment media, the health care industry and\n  even from Capitol Hill. Will the film\u2019s box-office draw also have some\n  affect on the 2008 ballot box? Jeff Greenfield will take a look.\n\u00a0\nTo wrap up our broadcast, Cynthia Bowers will take a\n  look at the receding shorelines of the largest freshwater lake in the world\n  \u2013 Lake Superior. Over the past decade\n  the lake\u2019s water level has dropped 2 \u00bd feet \u2013 that\u2019s 16\n  trillion gallons of water. Where has it gone? We\u2019ll tell you tonight.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
