I have tried several times to send\nthem\nEmail and have never had a single response.\n\nI am told that 4.6.4 is more compatible and apparently\neven sounds better than the newer 5.0 release.\n\nI am trying to find someone who might actually be able\nto  \ncreate a wave or mp3 file of at least 30 seconds of\nspeech at about 210 to 220 words per minute so I can\nevaluate if this is something I'd be interested in\nusing.\n\nAny input on the Fonix DecTalk for Linux speech\npackage would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n//Rich//\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
