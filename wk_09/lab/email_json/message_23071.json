After doing a \"fresh install\" using the amazing Debian installer which pre-configures LUKS, what extra steps, if any, are needed to accomplish this goal?\n\nThe assumption being that on a non-encrypted system, hibernation works without problems.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
