We found the \nclient.txt was obtained snooping the traffic of the NetBench of the \nversion ~=3.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- is there anybody who has the client.txt derived from the NetBench v7 \ntraffic or who is experienced with the creating it?\n\n- is anybody know the differences which can cause such performance drop?\n\nThank you in advance for any idea.\n\nRegards\n\nJiri\n\n"}
