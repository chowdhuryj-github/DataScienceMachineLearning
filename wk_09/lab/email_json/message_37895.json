If the former, has onyone \nseen how to split an mle() function call to be processed by multiple cpus?\n\nIn the case if, I would very much appreicate your hint or point to a source \nwhere I can read about.\n\nThanks Toby\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
