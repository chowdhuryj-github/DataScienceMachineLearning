But my motivation is a bit low on it right now.\nMaybe next week.  Tomorrow is a holiday in the US\nand the rest of the week is already committed to other\ncoding projects.\n\nMy criteria is:\n\na) Importing the existing svn history.  I'm also looking at\n   if it is possible to import the original cvs history\n   as well.  I've heard that this has been done (cvs+svn import)\nb) The DVCS should enable development (including patch\n   submission) and not hinder it.  This include performance\n   and usability (probability in that order or importance).\n   People can learn tools but really bad performance can be\n   too hard to tolerate.\nc) Good merging between branches and remote repositories\n   and maintaining history\nd) Easy local branching\ne) Low overhead publishing of private branches\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGit77IR7qMdg1EfYRAr/SAJsEzWYJkZxfGeiQlbOTnvOEAWRo8ACgtXzU\nT0y96Ts4qDsPBxHRv5n7aGE=\n=EaR5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
