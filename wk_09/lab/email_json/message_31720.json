Most of the \n              ingredients are food colorings derived from plants that are supposedly \n              not \"commercially available\" in organic form. But at least \n              three of the proposed ingredients, backed by beer giant Anheuser-Busch \n              and pork and food processors, represent a serious threat to organic \n              standards, and have raised the concerns of the Organic Consumers \n              Association (OCA), as well as a number of smaller organic companies \n              and organic certifiers. Specifically, the OCA disagrees with the \n              \"Budweiser exemption,\" allowing conventionally grown hops, \n              produced with pesticides and chemical fertilizers, to be used in \n              beers labeled as \"USDA Organic\". Also, OCA strenuously \n              objects to the USDA's proposal to allow the use of conventionally \n              raised factory-farmed animals' intestines (we'll spare you the \n              gory details of what thes animals have been fed) as casing for \n              sausages labeled as \"organic.\" Adding salt to the wound, \n              the USDA has indicated the public comment period will not be the \n              standard 30-60 days. Although the USDA has been working closely \n              with industry on these proposed changes as far back as 2002, the \n              agency will only be accepting public comments for seven days. Take \n              action now and forward this alert to interested friends and colleagues. \n              \nLearn more and sign the OCA petition to the USDA: \n              http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5225.cfm\n\n\n___________________________________\nWe \n          rely on your donations to continue policing organic standards.

Next week (May 21), the House Agriculture Subcommittee on \n              Conservation will decide whether to make cuts in the Conservation \n              Security Program, an innovative program that helps sustainable and \n              organic farmers protect the environment and preserve wetlands. Congress \n              has already cut this program by $4.3 billion and is considering \n              making further cuts. We need to send a strong message to Washington \n              that it's time to move our food and farming system away from chemical \n              and energy-intensive industrial agriculture towards conservation, \n              organic practices, and less dependence on petroleum-based inputs. \n              Contact your Congressional Representative now and tell them to please \n              use taxpayers' money wisely by restoring full funding to the Conservation \n              Security Program.\n              Take action: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5226.cfm\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\n              CATASTROPHIC BEE COLONY COLLAPSE IS NOT AFFECTING ORGANIC HIVES\n\n              As previously reported in Organic Bytes (Issue #104), beekeepers \n              in 24 states are experiencing record losses of honeybees. Some states \n              have reported up to 70% disappearances of commercial bee populations. \n              Researchers are struggling to find the causes of this mysterious \n              collapse. A crucial element of this story, missing from reports \n              in the mainstream media, is the fact that organic beekeepers across \n              North America are not experiencing colony collapses. The millions \n              of dying bees are hyper-bred varieties whose hives are regularly \n              fumigated with toxic pesticides by conventional beekeepers attempting \n              to ward off mites. In contrast, organic beekeepers avoid pesticides \n              and toxic chemicals and strive to use techniques that closely emulate \n              the ecology of bees in the wild. Researchers are beginning to link \n              the mass deaths of non-organic bees to pesticide exposure, genetically \n              modified organisms (GMOs), and the common practice of moving conventional \n              bee hives over long distances.\nLearn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/bees.cfm\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nphoto \n                parody\n\nSUSTAINABILITY \n              TIP OF THE WEEK: \n              MORE WAYS TO PREPARE FOR PEAK OIL \nWe \n                began posting Sharon Astyk's insightful tips in our Organic Bytes \n                issue #104, which highlighted her first 50 peak oil tips.

In the their study, researchers analyzed \n              the juice consumption of 3,618 children ages 2 to 11 using data \n              from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Increased \n              risk for obesity was linked to beverages that contained artificial \n              sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup, which makes up the vast \n              majority of beverages on the market (note: most high fructose \n              corn syrup is made from genetically engineered corn). \"The \n              bottom line is that 100 percent juice consumption is a valuable \n              contributor of nutrients in children's diet and it does not have \n              an association with being overweight,\" said study chief Dr. \n              Theresa Nicklas.\n\nLearn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5108.cfm\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT \n                PLUNDER OF THE WEEK: \n                AVOIDING FRUIT JUICE SCAMS\n                Large beverage manufacturers are notorious for putting labels \n                on their products that mislead consumers into believing that these \n                junk-food drinks are pure fruit or else contain more juice than \n                they really have. If you are shopping for 100% pure fruit juice, \n                here's how to avoid getting scammed:\n\nAlways \n                  read the ingredient label on the back of the product. If there's \n                  anything other than fruit juice in the product, it must be listed \n                  there. \n\"Made \n                  with REAL Fruit Juice\" could mean it really only has a \n                  small percentage of fruit juice. \nAll \n                  beverages that imply they contain juice must declare the percentage \n                  of juice on the information label near the top of the Nutrition \n                  Facts panel. \nIf \n                  a product is labeled as Fruit drink, juice beverage, juice cocktail \n                  or \"ade\" -- the product is likely full of artificial \n                  sweeteners and contains very little juice. \nOftentimes \n                  a \"100% juice\" product contains juice fillers. Read \n                  the ingredient label, and you'll frequently find your cranberry \n                  juice, for example, is mostly apple juice. \nKeep \n                  in mind that conventional fruits and juices contain pesticide \n                  residues, and that industrial scale fruit production is an environmental \n                  disaster. Protect your health and the health of the planet by \n                  consuming organic fruits and fruit juices.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\nORGANIC \n              BYTES READERS TALK BACK ALERT: \n              USDA SAYS ALMONDS LABELED AS 'RAW' CAN ACTUALLY BE PASTEURIZED \nREADER'S \n                QUESTION: In Organic Bytes #107 you wrote about the USDA passing \n                a new regulation that will require almonds to be pasteurized even \n                though they may be labeled \"raw\". I understand the public \n                comment period is over, but I'd still like to let the USDA know \n                how I feel about this. Can you help?\nOCA'S \n                RESPONSE: We've received a lot of emails and phone calls from \n                our readers on this issue. The USDA approved this regulation with \n                little public notification. As a result, the only comments the \n                agency received were from the industrial agriculture lobbyists. \n                One of the FDA-recommended pasteurization methods requires the \n                use of propylene oxide, which is classified as a \"possible \n                human carcinogen\". Organic and family-scale almond farmers \n                are protesting the proposed rule, saying it will effectively put \n                them out of business, since the minimum price for the pasteurization \n                equipment is $500,000. We feel this issue is too important to \n                let rest. \nLearn more and take action: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5227.cfm\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\nWEB \n              VIDEO OF THE WEEK: \n              SOAP, DRUGS, AND ROCK & ROLL\n              In a recent bizarre encounter between the punk rock band, The Germs, \n              and law enforcement officials in California, it was discovered that \n              standard field drug testing kits could distinguish the difference \n              between soap products that are made from natural and organic ingredients \n              and products that may claim to be organic but really contain synthetic \n              detergents made in part or entirely from petroleum.
