Does anyone know whether one exists, or\ndid the graph just disappear in the newer version of R?\n\nThanks for any help,\n\nDr. Jenifer Larson-Hall\nAssistant Professor of Linguistics\nUniversity of North Texas\n(940)369-8950\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
