But there was an  \noption for \"Excel 97 and ...\", and that seemed to allow using value  \nlabels instead of the values (again you have to check the  \ncorresponding box). So perhaps that would be an option.\n\nHaris Skiadas\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science\nHanover College\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
