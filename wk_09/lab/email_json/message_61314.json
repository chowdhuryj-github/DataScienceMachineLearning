What I want is essentially a \nsecondary ylab for each row, and don't care about niceties such as \nshingle markings (I should have made the conditional factor(cyl) in the \nabove plot).\n\nBut it looks like the legend goes to the left of the plot's ylab, and \nwhat I really want is for the secondary ylab to be between the primary \nylab and the panel. So looks like I would have to eliminate the primary \nylab from being drawn automatically and draw it myself in the legend? \nAnd I think I would have to manually calculate the panel heights as \nwell, right? I don't see a way for the legend to get this out of the \ntrellis object.\n\n> xyplot(mpg ~ disp | cyl, mtcars, strip=F, strip.left=T, layout=c(1, 3),\n>        scales=list(relation=\"free\", y = list(draw = FALSE)),\n>        axis = function(side, ...) {\n>            if (side == \"right\")\n>                panel.axis(side = \"right\", outside = TRUE)\n>            else axis.default(side = side, ...)\n>        },\n>        par.settings=\n>        list(strip.background=list(col=\"transparent\"),\n>             layout.widths = list(axis.key.padding = 5)))\n\nThis seems a lot easier.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
