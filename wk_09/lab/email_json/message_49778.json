Better safe than sorry, \nalways do mrproper before building a kernel. It can't hurt anything \nand does make sure there are no old deps or object modules around. \nmrproper is a superset of clean so if you do that you don't need to \nalso do clean.\n\nAlso, it doesn't seem right to copy an existing  .config after doing the \nspeakup patch. The speakup patch adds new items into .config after \nspeakup is selected in menuconfig, the CONFIG_SPEAKUP and \nother related entries. If you copied in a .config from a kernel without \nspeakup then it won't have the speakup stuff in .config. If you copy \nsome existing .config then it may not match the kernel that you are\ncompiling from source. If it's the same kernel version that you used \nbefore it will work, but if you now have a newer kernel it may or \nmay not work, and you might be missing some new stuff that's in the \nnewer kernel version. \n\nIt is a pain to go through the config, but worthwhile to understand \nwhat you need and don't for your hardware. There is so much in \nthe kernel that is not needed on most systems. If you set all those\nto not be included, then you have a whole lot less to compile.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.8.17/850 - Release Date: 6/15/2007\n11:31 AM\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
