Those mirrors might not be up-to-date; they \nmight not even be CPAN mirrors anymore.\n\nI suggest going through the entire CPAN configuration again: \"o conf \ninit\"; you'll get a chance to select a new set of mirrors and other options.\n\nProbably the indexes will be re-downloaded after you've finished the \nconfiguration, but if they're not, do \"reload index\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
