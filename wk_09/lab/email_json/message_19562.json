Requires a rename at least.\n\nIs this what is going to happen to free software as it becomes\nmore popular?  Every author's ego projection will trump sharing and\nredistribution?  Heck, if their ego is that demanding, why don't they call\nthe official version \"Brian Clough's ion3\" (or whatever the author's name\nis)?\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
