The mandatory else-part is one of the most valuable features of \n> the ternary operator.

'think'\n>               !! $shirt eq 'red'  ??  'die'\n>               !!                      'stand';\n> \n> The required-ness of the else-part makes cascaded ternaries a safer, more \n> robust choice than if-elsif-else chains in many cases.\n> \n> Damian\n\n"}
