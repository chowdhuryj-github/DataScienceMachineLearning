So I have two vectors:  a vector of\nlabels V1= c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\") and vector B which is a vector of frequencies\nof A, B, C and D respectively  V2=c(20,50,60,30). I wanted to plot a\nhistogram of the labels using the frequencies. I could not figure out a way\nto do this using the 'hist' function which takes only the full data vector\nas input. Could you please help me with this?\n\nThank you,\nSuman\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
