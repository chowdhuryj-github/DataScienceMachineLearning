The same \nlobbying tactics may be successful in getting extremely harmful bills \nbrought forward and fast-tracked without consultation or debate.\n\n   The Senate has its hands full with other bills (including the budget \nbill), and it is highly unlikely they will debate it at all.\n\n   The Government wants to prorogue rather than recess for the summer as \nthey want to Kill Bill C-30 (the by-committee revised Clean air and \nClimate Change act).  If they prorogue then this causes all unpassed \nbills die on the order paper, meaning all government and private members \nbills would have to be re-introduces and the Conservatives don't want \nthere to be a climate change act.\n\n   Some Liberal members of the senate have said they will delay the \nbudget bill to force the Conservatives to recess, allowing them to pass \nthe budget without this immediately killing C-30.\n\n   This is all typical procedural trickery that the Conservatives are \ninto.  I've seen them pull some pretty nasty fast ones, including last \nFriday when they tried to pass the budget through a loophole that \ninvolved a motion changing the order of business after most \nparliamentarians were already heading back to constituencies. \nFortunately this one was caught (people running back into the house who \nwere otherwise heading for a plane).  Pretty dishonest stuff, but not \nstuff the general public would understand -- and thus stuff they can get \naway with without voters getting upset.\n\n   I wonder how much of this was in their controversial Handbook they \ncreated to describe how to manipulate parliament and committees.\n\nBTW: I'm not wanting to pick on the Conservatives.  At least old-school \nLiberal members are generally honest about their hatred for the Internet \nand new media/new economy.   The Conservatives seem to rather avoid \nanswering controversial questions and prefer to use procedural trickery.\n\n   Hard to stick to being non-partisan with some of what I observe every \nday with the federal parliament.\n\n-- \n  Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n  Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n  rights as owners of Information Technology.
