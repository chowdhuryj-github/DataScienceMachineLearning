Are you excited yet?\n\n\nTonight he dons his lounge suit to give his final speech to the City great and good at the Mansion House. Stephanie Flanders will be there to hear what he says.\n\n\nEQUITY\n\n\nShe'll also be reporting on the continuing row over the 10% tax break enjoyed by those private equity buccaneers who've made such a splash of late. We first reported that row in February - watch that report here.\n\n\nBut is it really sustainable for a chancellor who has talked about ending poverty to allow the mega rich to benefit from a lower tax rate than their office cleaners?\n\n\nLIB DEMS\n\n\nAlso more confirmation today about the talks between Zombie Brown and the Liberal Democrats. What have they been about? Michael Crick is on the case.\n\n\nMichael first reported on this story back in May, and he even asked Zombie Brown about it - you can watch his report here.\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nAnd that item on top of the Zombie Brown in-tray - should I, should I not have a referendum on the treaty? David Grossman has the latest on public opinion from Brussels.\n\n\nCREDIT CARD FRAUD\n\n\nAlso, credit card fraud - do the police care any more? The latest Home Office rules say the public should not bother the police if their credit card details are used by a fraudster - only banks can report this crime. Is this a green light to more credit card theft? Martin Shankleman has all the details.\n\n\nBLAIR\n\n\nFinally what about the man who is currently in the PM's job? Tony Blair and David Cameron had their usual clash at PMQs today. The next time that happens will be on Tony Blair's last day. Those who've faced Tony Blair across the dispatch box give us an insight into just what a formidable opponent he was and still is.\n\n\nJeremy will be hosting the debate at 10.30. Do join him.\n\n\nSimon\n\n\nMissed Newsnight?\n\nClick here to watch the latest programme online \n\n\nNewsnight Blog\n\nAdd your comments to our correspondents' blogs:\n\nCLICK HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0LAST NIGHT'S HIGHLIGHT\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMIN GIVES WORK TO KIDS' CHARITY\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBritish artists including Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst have donated works for auction to support the NSPCC.\n\n\nWatch the item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
