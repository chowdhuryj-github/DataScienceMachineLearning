Specifically, look at the file\npages/result/index.php  They have done lots of other good stuff in their\nproject, like filtering dangerous commands - you would not want to let a\nuser just type in any R code, because they could seriously damage your\nserver. However, if you keep the R code on the server, and just parse\nnumeric or string inputs, you can take the simple approach described\nabove.\n\nYou will need to install GhostScript (http://www.gnu.org/software/\nghostscript/ghostscript.html) and ImageMagick (http://\nwww.imagemagick.org/) on your server for the image conversion\n\nFeel free to email me directly if you have problems\n\nJohn\nhttp://www.labsynch.com\n\nOn Apr 19, 2007, at 2:46 AM, d. sarthi maheshwari wrote:\n\n> Hi\n>\n> I am trying to provide web interface to my R application.
