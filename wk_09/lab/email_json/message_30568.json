Here's a sample use of xtabs,\nwhich you should adapt to your example (I'm not sure if you want to\ndisregard MM and DD):\n\n> foo\n   ID YYYY MM DD HH MM.1 Type\n1 YEG 2002  1  1  1   24    A\n2 YEG 2002  1  1  2   40    R\n3 YEG 2002  1  1  5   39    R\n4 YEG 2002  1  1  9   17    A\n> as.data.frame(xtabs(~Type + YYYY + HH, foo))\n  Type YYYY HH Freq\n1    A 2002  1    1\n2    R 2002  1    0\n3    A 2002  2    0\n4    R 2002  2    1\n5    A 2002  5    0\n6    R 2002  5    1\n7    A 2002  9    1\n8    R 2002  9    0\n\n(xtabs itself will produce a 3-D array, which you may or may not be\ncomfortable working with).\n\n-Deepayan\n\n>\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Deepayan Sarkar [mailto:deepayan.sarkar@gmail.com]\n> Sent: May 15, 2007 3:46 PM\n> To: Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]\n> Cc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: Re: [R] How to group a count\n>\n> On 5/15/07, Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]  wrote:\n> > Hello R users\n> > I have a dataset that has different types of records with different\n> > dates and times pertaining to each.
