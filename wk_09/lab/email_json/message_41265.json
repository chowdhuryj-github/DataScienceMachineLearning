And then see if you're Speech-Dispatcher tests work out that way.\nLerenzo, have you tested these out yet?\nI really really hope the day comes soon where Hynek can at least announce with pleasure that these weird crash bugs are finally resolved. \nWhen do you think another version of SpeechD-up for Speakup will be released? 0.4 is so old. Wonder if the CVS stuff is really any better despite being development code? I will happily test it, eaven if it breaks my Virtual systems ;).\nRegards, --Keith.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
