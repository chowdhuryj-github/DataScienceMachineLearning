Does anybody have any advice?\nHi,\n\nI'm not sure if I good understand but if you need install Debian then\nyou have several possibilities:\n\n- netinst \n\nthis Debian installation image offer you install with brltty support.\nYou need only say in prompt on beginning of installation:\n\ninstall brltty\n\nThis image you can find on debian.org\n\n- bootstrap\n\nYou can install on Debian another Debian to same or other disk on same\nmachine or on some mounted FS. The package called debootstrap. See a man\npage.\n\n- live CD\n\nYou can use some speaking live cd based on Debian and the install with\ndebootstrap or copy the live CD.\n\nBest.\n\n\n-- \n\nJan Buchal\nTel: (00420) 24 24 86 008\nMob: (00420) 608023021\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
