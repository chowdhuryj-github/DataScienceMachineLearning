The reason that I am writing this email is looking\nfor helps of using JRI in Java Axis Web Service. Well, I am not quite\nsure if this is the right place to ask this kind of questions, but I\ncan't find the JRI mailing list. So please give me some hints if this is\nnot the right place to ask these kinds of questions.\n\n \n\nI've been asked to develop a Java Axis web service to retrieve an\nR-script file from the client side and then using JRI jar file in order\nto call the R program that installed on the web service server. After\nreading the online documentation, I've successfully installed the R\nprogram with rJava and JRI packages. In addition, I can call the R\nprogram to run the R-script by using org.rosuda.JRI.Rengine. Everything\nis running fine if this program is running as a normal Java application.\nHowever, I fail to obtain any return when I was trying to consume this\nmethod by using the Java Axis web service.\n\n \n\nSo I am wondering if any one could share their experiences to using JRI\nin Axis web service. Your helps mean a lot to me and I've been struggled\nto fix this problem for days.\n\n \n\nThanks\n\n \n\nKind Regards\n\n \n\nEric Jiang\n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
