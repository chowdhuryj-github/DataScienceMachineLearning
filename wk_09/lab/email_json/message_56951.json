Let's do the following exercise to reproduce the problem I'm facing. In the following code, I tried to have plot.rw1 and plot.rw2 shows in two separate rows on my plot windows. However, after the call to the 2nd levelplot, plot of plot.rw2 replace my first plot and the result shows only 1 row on my windows. Any lights on this would be really appreciated.
