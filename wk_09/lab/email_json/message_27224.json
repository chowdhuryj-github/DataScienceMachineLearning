The file exists and has no permission issues etc, just a regular\nfile open. Is there any reason why the server might do this?\n\nMurali\n\n-- \nRgds,\nMurali Bashyam\n(c) (510)6736915\n\n----------------------------- CONFIDENTIAL  --------------------\n*****************************************************\nThis telecommunication and any data attached to, or included in it\nis considered confidential, and is intended only for use by the named\nrecipient.
