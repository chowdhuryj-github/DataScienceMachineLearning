Mind that any ASCII-character is a\nUTF-8 character too (U+0000 .. U+007F).\n\n\n> So I'm trying to see if I can just use /(\\w+)/ without worrying about\n> all this character encoding?\n\nOnly if your data is proper. A file is just a string of bytes. If you\nuse the proper IO-layer while reading in the file, then you'll end up\nwith proper data (a string of characters, not of bytes) to work with.\n\nA UTF-8 encoded file can't tell you that it is UTF-8 encoded. For\nexample a UTF-8 BOM at the start (as Windows Notepad uses) is not proof.\nSo you need to know beforehand.\n\n-- \nAffijn, Ruud\n\n\"Gewoon is een tijger.\"\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
