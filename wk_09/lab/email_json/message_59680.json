Completes Acquisition of Southern \nOffroad Vehicle ServicesJune 27, 2:00 pm ET \nBAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- EXTR EME Motorsports of \nCalifornia, Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) (\"EXTR EME\" or the \"Company\"), has \ncompleted the acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC (\"SOVS\"), a \ncompany dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road \nvehicles. Through this acquisition, EXTR EME will not only be able to offer its \ncustomers direct financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first \nsandcar manufacturer \u00a0As previously announced, in exchange for all \nof the capital stock of SOVS, EXTREM E has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million \nshares of EXTRE ME common stock. Of the 15 million share of common stock, 10 \nmillion will be restricted shares of common stock and 5 million will be \nfree-trading shares.\nIn the past, EXTR EME required customer down-payments at contract signing and \nfinal payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required EXTR EME to \nfinance the 12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow \nof the company. Now, EXTR EME will be able to achieve both greater throughput and \nprofit margins by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has \ncurrently secured $14 million in financing for future customers of EXTR EME, both \nfor direct purchases and for leased vehicles. This will provide E XTREME with \nimmediate funding for the build-out of custom sandcars for private customers and \n\"spec\" vehicles for its dealers.\n\"The acquisition of SOVS provides EXTREM E with the capability to deliver \ndirect financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard \nover-the-road vehicles,\" commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of EXTRE ME \nMotorsports. \"Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar \nmanufacturer in the world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. \nThis not only ensures consistent operating cash flows to EXTR EME, but \nincentivizes buyers who might otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to \ncomplete a purchase immediately through consumer financing.\"\nAbout E XTREME Motorsports of California, Inc.\nEXTREM E Motorsports of California, Inc., operating under the trade name \n\"Xtreme Motorsports,\" is a manufacturer of custom and production-line sandrails, \ndesert and dual sport racecars.
