Not being sure if your data range above actually includes 0, you may\nwant to consider a log scaled axis, if not.\n\n2. I might be tempted to use two plots:\n\n  A. A first a plot of the entire data set, showing the 3 outliers\n\n  B. A second plot of the 297 pairs with axes constrained to the\n     appropriate ranges to enable better visualization of the data\n     structure.\n\nIf number 2 is more appropriate, you could also use par(\"mfcol\") to set\nup side by side plots. See ?par.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
