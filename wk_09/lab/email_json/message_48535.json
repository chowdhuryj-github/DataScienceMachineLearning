If \nyou have your own Fortran 90 compiler, you can enter it into MkRules \n(either by enabling the GCC4 macro, or entering it directly in the F95 \nmacro).\n\nBut you should have got an error about the compiler not existing, not an \nerror about no source files.\n\nAre you sure you named the file *.f90?  I get a check warning about no \nsource files if I name the file test.F90, but not for test.f90.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
