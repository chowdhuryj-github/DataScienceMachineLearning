But [1]in many offices Wi-Fi has been a headache. Like all\nradio signals, Wi-Fi is subject to interference. Its low power \\u2014 less\nthan even a typical cellphone \\u2014 means that walls and cabinets can\nsignificantly reduce signal strength. Wi-Fi also creates networks that\nare more open than wired ones, raising security issues. And Wi-Fi has\ncaused problems for virtual private networks. Some VPNs require a lot of\nprocessing power. If a wireless access point \\u2014 at home, at the office, or\non the road \\u2014 isn't robust enough, a user often gets bumped off the\nconnection.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/26/1748235\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://online.wsj.com/public/us\n    1. http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118282236794247982.html?mod=blog\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Day of Silence On the Internet                                     |\n|   from the silence-speaks-louder-than-tracks dept.                 |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday June 26, @15:14 (Music)             |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/26/1855202          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nA number of readers sent in stories about [0]Net radio going dark for a\nday.

The BBC story quotes a number of impact experts who doubt the\nItalians' claim. \"A University of Bologna team says a lake near the\nepicenter of the blast may be occupying a crater hollowed out by a chunk\nof rock that hit the ground. Lake Cheko \\u2014 though shallow \\u2014 fits the\nproportions of a small, bowl-shaped impact crater, say the Italy-based\nscientists. Their investigation of the lake bottom's geology reveals a\nfunnel-like shape not seen in neighboring lakes.
