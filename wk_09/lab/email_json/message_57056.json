If \nthe two responses are regarded as independent, this would be easy, but mlm \nis also the basis of 'manova' models: see ?anova.mlm and ?summary.manova. \nGiven Spencer's point 2, independence is not normally what people intend \nwhen fitting a multivariate linear model: more likely they are fitting a \nmodel with correlated observations not by maximum likelihood (and hence \nAIC is not appropriate).\n\n>      2.
