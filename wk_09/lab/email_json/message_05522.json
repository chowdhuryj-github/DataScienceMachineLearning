NFS sends a lookup for every path component\n(not really required for cifs).   I would not be surprised if a simple\n\"ls\" like operation in a desktop would have to generate more traffic in\nNFSv4 than CIFS but presumably is worth diving into when the next POSIX\nextensions patches are added to Linux and MAC cifs clients.\n\n\n\n"}
