Without an established RTO, planning for comprehensive transmission expansion becomes a combined effort by the states and the utilities that serve them. \n\u00a0\nMany entities have taken initiative over the past few years and to date over 20 transmission projects are in some form of development. Yet for the most part, the Western US is building transmission capacity in advance of generation. \n\u00a0\nHow will this affect future projects and the long-term outlook on power purchasing from load serving entities?\nWhile much of the planning and siting issues have been and continue to be addressed, issues still remain on the load mix and how states will meet air quality standards and RPS requirements.\n\u00a0 \nHow do utilities decide what type of power to buy, considering these constraints and what effect does that have on their interest in new transmission? \n\u00a0\nFor the numerous renewable energy projects in the West, how does building high capacity transmission encourage development and does it guarantee that renewable electricity will get to the places that need it and/or are required to have it?\n\u00a0\n It seems there has been no shortage on the investment end for transmission expansion, yet there are staging issues that can delay the build-out. After initial interest is expressed in specific lines, what does financing look like at different stages for rights-of-way and EIS and then to actual construction? \n\u00a0\nThis conference will explore these issues in-depth with utilities, investment groups, regulators and other state officials.\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n  Click\n                        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n  Renewable \n                            Power Project Finance: The Tutorial\nApril 30 - May 2, 2007\n                            New York, NY \n  A Water \n                            Constrained Future - How Producers Can Minimize Impacts in the West\nSan Diego, CA\n                              May 1-2, 2007 \n   GasFair-PowerFair 2007\nToronto, Ont\n                            May 1-2, 2007 \n  Recognizing and \n                            Recovering Energy Theft\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Cost-Effective \n                            Transmission Technology\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Western \n                            Renewable Power Development Summit\nSan Francisco, CA\n                              May 7-9, 2007 \n   Solar Power Project Finance & Investment Summit\nSan Diego, CA\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  Gas Mart \n                            2007\nChicago, IL\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  In-Depth \n                            introduction to the Natural Gas Industry\nDallas, TX\n                              May 15-16, 2007 \n  Natural Gas \n                            Transactions, Trading and Origination for Non-Traders\nDallas, TX\n                              May 16-17, 2007 \n  Developing and \n                            Launching New Products and Services for Utilities\nDallas, TX\n                              May 17-18, 2007 \n  Performance \n                            Benchmarking For Energy Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007 \n  Pandemic \n                            Preparedness For Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007  \u00a0 \n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
