I thought that\ncould be installation problem, and I tried\ninstall.packages or biocLite, every time the package\ninstalled fine, except some warning messages below:\nld64 warning: in /usr/lib/libxml2.dylib, file does not\ncontain requested architecture\nld64 warning: in /usr/lib/libz.dylib, file does not\ncontain requested architecture\nld64 warning: in /usr/lib/libiconv.dylib, file does\nnot contain requested architecture\nld64 warning: in /usr/lib/libz.dylib, file does not\ncontain requested architecture\nld64 warning: in /usr/lib/libxml2.dylib, file does not\ncontain requested architecture\n\nHere is the error messages I got, when XML is loaded:\n> library(XML)\nError in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local),\nas.logical(now)) : \n        unable to load shared library\n'/usr/local/lib64/R/library/XML/libs/XML.so':\n  dlopen(/usr/local/lib64/R/library/XML/libs/XML.so,\n6): Symbol not found: _xmlMemDisplay\n  Referenced from:\n/usr/local/lib64/R/library/XML/libs/XML.so\n  Expected in: flat namespace\nError: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'XML'\nError: package/namespace load failed for 'XML'\n\nI understand that it has been pointed out that\nSys.getenv(\"PATH\") needs to be revised in the file\nXML/R/zzz.R, but I can\\u2019t even find that file under\nXML/R/ directory. Does anybody have any idea what\nmight be the problem, and how to solve it? Thanks a\nlot!\nBTW, the reason I need to use R64 is that I have\nmemory limitation issue with R 32 bit version when I\nload some very large XML trees. \n\nSession information\n> sessionInfo()\nVersion 2.3.1 Patched (2006-06-27 r38447) \npowerpc64-apple-darwin8.7.0 \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] \"methods\"   \"stats\"     \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\"\n\"utils\"     \"datasets\" \n[7] \"base\"     \n\nWeijun\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
