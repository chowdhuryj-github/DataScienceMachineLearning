I'm afraid testing will have to wait until \ntomorrow.  The rsync server at svn.perl.org is still down, and the \nsnapshot on svn.perl.org hasn't picked up that patch yet.\n\n(svn isn't an option.  Each of the last two times I tried it, I lost a\nfull day fighting its configure/build system, and in the end it took\nbetween one and two *hours* to download parrot.  I'm not going through\nthat again!)\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
