I tried booting the speakup.i \nwhatever, and it's not there; just the speakup.s file.  Rebooted Windows \njust to make sure it was on the install DVD, and it's snot.  So, I tried \nthe speakup.s file just for the flock of it and it worked.  Only problem \nis that according to the docs, it's the SCSI kernal, and I'm running \nIDE.  I'm wondering if they packed the IDE modules into the .s kernal to \nsave space.  Anyone tried installing Slack-11 off DVD lately using \nspeakup.s on an IDE system?  TIA,\n\n         Michael\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
