I'm one of those Luddites who uses Google\nGroups.\nI don't have a particular opinion about keeping usenet/mailing lists/\nwhatever\nsomehow \"pure\" by allowing only certain access tools/avenues.  Okay,\nmaybe\nI do have an opinion, but it's not particularly strong.  :-)\n\nIf a group (generic group, not GG) is open to the public, you'll get a\nshare of\nthat public that you don't particularly like.  I'll concede that\nGoogle Groups may\nmake public access easier and thus increase the likelihood that\nundesirables\nwill participate.\n\nRegards,\n\n--\nBrad\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
