The paper outlines the statements and the\npositions that the EU has taken in its negotiations with the ACP and\ndescribes the approach of the EU to IP in the proposed EPAs. It concludes\nthat the EU attaches central importance to IP in the EPA negotiations and\nsuggests some reasons why.\n\n\n\nThe paper is available at\nhttp://www.ciel.org/Publications/EU_EPAs_Draft_18Apr07.pdf.
