But (as you implicitly surmise) I don't use a Mac\n(just non-psychedelic Linux).\n\nHowever, as a follow-up, I've since found that one can (somewhat\ntediously) do what I was asking with the GIMP.\n\nIf you start the GIMP on a PostScript file, you initially get a\n\"Load PostScript\" window which asks you to choose (amongst other\nthings\" the \"resolution\", initially \"100\". If you wind this up\nto say \"1000\", then you get 10 times the positional precision\nin the numbers shown as below.\n\nWhen the image is displayed, there is again a little window\nwhich gives you the GIMP coordinates of the mouse position.\nWith increased \"Resolution\", the numerical values vary\ncorrespondingly more rapidly with position.\n\nThe tedious aspect (compared with 'gv') is that to get better\nvisual resolution you need to zoom the image. This enlarges the\nwhole image, with the result that you have to pan around to\nlocate different parts, and you can get lost in a graph with\nlots of widely-spread points.\n\nWith 'gv', on the other hand, you can select any small part\nto view in zoom in a sub-window, which is much easier to cope\nwith; and you also get a \"rubber-band\" rectangle which enables\nyou to readily align points here with points there -- e.g. if\nyou want to read off a curve the y-value corresponding to say\nx=5.0.\n\nHowever, this is at least a partial answer to my own question!\n\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 15-Jun-07                                       Time: 17:29:49\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 15-Jun-07                                       Time: 20:32:59\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
