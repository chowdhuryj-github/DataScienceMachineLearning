You are probably already familiar with the work by James Taylor\nin this area. I contacted him and he was kind enough to share some of his\n(Gauss) code, and I have tried to implement it in R, but due to my lack of\nprogramming skill I don't really trust the results and it is very slow. I\nwill try to get it to the point where it could be useful for others.\n\nbest,\n\nSpencer\n\n\n\nOn 6/14/07, Paulo Tanimoto  wrote:\n>\n> Dear R community,\n>\n> I have a project with electricity load forecasting, and I got hourly\n> data for system load.
