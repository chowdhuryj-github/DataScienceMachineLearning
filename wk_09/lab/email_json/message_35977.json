Currently \nGCompris organizes activities into a tree. There are 8 top-level \nactivity categories and lots of activities beneath each category.\n\nAs you know, GCompris is being ported to the sugar environment so we \nneed to think about a proper solution.\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
