Now the \ninteresting thing about the page I was redirected to is that the hackers \nmust have cut spelling class regularly; they spelled technical techincal. \nThere is no way verizon with its professional employees and its good image \nto protect would ever willingly or knowingly put up a web page with such a \nmistake on it like that. In any case the system has been reinstalled and \nis shortly about to be backed up to another hard drive.  If that ever \nhappens again, I'll let clamav run to its absolute end since it may be \nable to tell us what that was that did that.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
