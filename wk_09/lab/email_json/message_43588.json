My philosophy: No pain, no pain.\n\nMen are Moved by two levers only: fear and self interest\n\nOur own physical body possesses a wisdom which we who inhabit the body lack. We give it orders which make no sense.\n\nThere is little much beyond the grave, but the strong are saying nothing until they see.\n\nWhatever you are, be a good one.\n\nDance like no one is watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like no one is listening, Live like it's heaven on earth.\n\nIgnorance is like a delicate fruit touch it, and the bloom is gone.\n\nMany people die at twenty five and aren't buried until they are seventy five.\n\nIt is better to know nothing than to know what ain't so.\n\nI do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.\n\nWhat's fame? a fancy'd life in other's breath. A thing beyond us, even before our death.\n\n\n"}
