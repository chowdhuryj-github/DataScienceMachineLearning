I've tried as a standard user and as root.  I don't understand why that the patching of speakup is causing this error when issuing the mrproper command.  Because the file named in the error isn't part of the tar ball in the first place.  The mrproper command doesn't produce this error until the kernel has been patched with speakup.  I've downloaded and checked out with fresh tar balls and the results are the same.\n>\n> I proceeded with the build which was successful, without errors and the kernel came up talking.\n>\n> Kirk are you aware of this?  I've built speakup into the kernel, oh thinking about it, the only speakup module is the software synth.  Which I haven't attempted to run.  It's occurred on a debian etch and also on a nearly complete lfs installation.\n>\n> make mrproper\n> awk: cmd. line:1: fatal: cannot open file `/usr/src/linux-2.6.21.5/include/linux/version.h' for reading (No such file or directory)\n>\n> Regards\n>\n> Gena\n>\n> Amateur Call: M 0 E B P\n>\n> VOIP / IM: gena1959uk\n>\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n>\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n__________ NOD32 2342 (20070621) Information __________\n\nThis message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\nhttp://www.eset.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
