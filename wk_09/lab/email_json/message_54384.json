Still getting used to BSD's way of doing things.  I used \ngroup access for specific task types I want restricted, like access to \nthe mailx command, which makes a wondermous spammers tool.  Also changed \nthe names of commands like attrib and used it to lock down programs, \nkeeping root kits guessing and less effective.  What I really would've \nliked to do is set up the security protocols to require that executables \nalso have attrib's indestructible bit set in order to run, and then \nre-write attrib so that it could only be run from the local keyboard. \nIt could be used to set up a virus/worm proof system if they can't \nupload and run anything without root permission.  Just don't break \nattrib or you'll have to reset the security protocols. from a bootup disk.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
