In each plot we can set title\nusing main and sub commands. \n\nHowever, is there any way that we can place an\nuniversal title above the set of plots placed in the\nsame page (not individual plot titles, all i need is a\ntitle of the whole graph page) as well as sib-titles?\nDo I need any package to do so?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nMohammad Ehsanul Karim (R - 2.3.1 on windows)\nInstitute of Statistical Research and Training\nUniversity of Dhaka\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
