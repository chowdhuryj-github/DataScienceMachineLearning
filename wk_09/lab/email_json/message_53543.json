The 2 gig limit applies for\nfat 16, but when you run fdisk at the dos prompt, it says something like\n\"your computer system can support a hard disk larger than-----\" \"Do you\nwant to access this larger disk?\"\n\nIt is before coffee and way too early in the morning for me to try and\nfigure out how they do it.  I don't recall the numbers, I remember\ndiscussing this stuff years ago on cluster size.  That is the smallest\namount of space a file would take no matter if it were a one byte file.\nI think it started out at 2 then 4 then 8 then 16 then 32.\n\nWay to early to figure this out!!!\n73s\nButch Bussen\nwa0vjr\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
