Hi everyone, A \n      prescription drug that's been taken by more than 6 million people has been \n      linked to a significantly higher risk of heart attack - and even death. \n      Wyatt Andrews will report on Avandia, and our medical correspondent \n      Dr. Jon LaPook will explain what this news means to families who \n      deal with type 2 diabetes. In other medical news, a new pill is \n      promising birth control with a boost. It could be relief for women from \n      the pains and inconveniences of their menstrual cycles. It is due to debut \n      tomorrow but, as Michelle Miller will report, its long-term safety \n      isn't clear. Gas prices have broken the record for high prices set \n      during the energy crisis of the early 1980s - when they are adjusted for \n      inflation - until now. Anthony Mason will report on how tight \n      refinery capacity is the latest cause of high prices at the pump, and \n      Byron Pitts will have the story of how gasoline costs are affecting \n      consumers. Tension in the Middle East can be another factor in \n      high gas prices and over the past two days violent urban warfare has \n      erupted in Lebanon. Intense fighting between Lebanese troops and Islamic \n      militants suspected of having ties to al Qaeda has killed dozens of \n      people. Mark Phillips will have the story. Some great \n      citizens of the country are being lauded for their valor in the wake of \n      Hurricane Katrina. Today one relatively unknown name is being added to the \n      list of John F. Kennedy \"Profile in Courage Award\" recipients, which \n      includes the likes of Kofi Annan and Gerald Ford. Her name is Doris \n      Voitier. Haven't heard of her? Correspondent Kelly Cobiella will \n      introduce you to this special woman tonight. I hope you'll \n      join us.
