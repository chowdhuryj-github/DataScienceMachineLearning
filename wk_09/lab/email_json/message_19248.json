The article discusses how the\n'big box' stores (e.g. Wal-Mart, Best Buy) are cutting back on space and\nacceptance of music CDs. With 85% of music sales still coming from CDs,\nmaybe this is another thing to push the music industry towards better\nonline sales models? 'Thanks largely to aggressive pricing and\nadvertising, big-box chains are now responsible in the U.S. for at least\n65% of music sales (including online and physical recordings), according\nto estimates by distribution executives, up from 20% a decade ago. Where\na store that depends on CDs for the bulk of its sales needs a profit\nmargin of around 30%, big chains get by making just 14% on music, say\nlabel executives who handle distribution. One of these executives\ndescribes the shift as a tidal wave.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/28/0148223\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117763890447584360.html?mod=hpp_us_editors_picks\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Blizzard Confirms New Product, May Be Starcraft 2                  |\n|   from the new-is-always-good dept.                                |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday April 27, @22:36 (PC Games (Games))     |\n|   http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/28/0150255        |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]darkhitman writes \"According to a Kotaku post yesterday, [1]Blizzard\nhas confirmed that they'll announce a new product at their World Wide\nInvitation in Korea next month.

The solar abundance of oxygen,\nwhich is key in astrophysics because of its use as a calibration\nreference for other objects, was thought to be well established since the\n80s. However, recent evidence indicates that it has been overestimated by\nalmost a factor of two. A revision of the solar oxygen abundance would\nhave a cascading effect on other important elements, such as carbon,\nnitrogen and neon, whose abundance is only known relative to that of\noxygen.
