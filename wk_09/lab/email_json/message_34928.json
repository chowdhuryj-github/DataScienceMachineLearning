Compulsory licences are\nlegal documents entitling a country to manufacture or import generic\ncopies of drugs considered essential to human health.\n\nThe decision received worldwide support from civil society organizations\ninvolved in HIV/AIDS work, but was heavily criticized by the US\ngovernment and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThai civil society organisations, led by people living with HIV, have\nover the years campaigned for the introduction of compulsory licensing\nof HIV drugs in order to reduce the cost of antiretroviral treatment in\nThailand.\n\nSince October 2003, the Thai government has had a policy of universal\ncoverage for antiretroviral treatment; patients receive their drugs free\nof charge.\n\nThailand has over 500,000 people living with HIV, and 80,000 are already\nreceiving antiretroviral treatment, i.e., a generic drug called GPO-VIR.\nThis first line treatment or first line therapy is a medical therapy\nrecommended for the initial treatment of the disease.\n\nApproximately 12,000 HIV positive people in the country have developed\ndrug resistance to the first line treatment. Second line therapy\n(treatment that is given when first-line therapy doesn't work, or stops\nworking) is the only option when HIV positive people develop drug\nresistance otherwise they die.\n\nThe Thai government says the current market price for second line\ntherapy is too high - about $2,200 or 73,000 baht - per person per year\nand that it cannot afford the huge cost.\n\nBy breaking the patent on Kaletra, the Thai government estimates it\nwould save 8,000 lives per year, by making distribution possible to\npeople who cannot afford it through the country's public health care system.\n\nThe World Bank has estimated that Thailand could reduce the cost of\nsecond-line therapy by 90% if it introduced compulsory licenses for all\nthe drugs it needs in second-line therapy, saving itself $3.2 billion\nover the next 20 years.\n\nMany countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Mozambique\nand Zambia, have broken or have threatened to break patents on drugs for\nHIV and other infectious diseases.\n\nThe May Monthly NGO Forum will focus on the issue of compulsory\nlicensing and adopt a common position shared by NGOs in Northern Thailand.\n\nThe Forum is organized by the Northern NGO Coalition on AIDS (NNCA),\nHealth & Development Networks (HDN), The Upper Northern Thai Network of\nPeople Living with HIV/AIDS (TNP+), The Church of Christ in Thailand\n(CCT) AIDS Ministry (CAM), AIDSNet Foundation, Maewang River Lowland\nPeople Community Radio Station (MLCR), Faith Based Organizations and\nother partnerships.\n\nMain speakers at the event will be:\n\n- Mr. John Ungpakorn, ex-senator and secretary of AIDSAccess Foundation\n- Mr. Arnan Muangmoonchai, chairman of The Upper Northern Thai Network\nof People Living with HIV/AIDS (TNP+).\n- Dr Prawate Khidarn, general secretary of the Christian Conference of\nAsia (CCA)\n- Asst. Prof Sanyalux Panvatalikit, PAYAP University Faculty of Law Lecturer\n\nMs. Sureerat Treemankra, a member of the National Economic and Social\nAdvisory Council (NESAC) will moderate the forum.\n\nPlease come and participate in this Monthly NGO Forum.\n\nTogether we are stronger.
