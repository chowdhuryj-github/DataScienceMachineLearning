I want a wide \nright margin (outside of the block of\nplots) so that I can place a legend there.\n\nI tried the following:\n\npar(\"mar\"=c(0,0,0,1), mfrow=c(4,4))\nfor (i in 8:23)  {\nimage(xx$ttt[2*(128:1),2*(128:1),i,1],axes=F,col=gray(0:15/15))\n}\n\nbut I get a margin to the right of every \nplot.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThis is usually not a problem for me because I \nmake each plot separately, but the journal \nrequires no subfigures.\n\nMany thanks and best wishes,\nRanjan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
