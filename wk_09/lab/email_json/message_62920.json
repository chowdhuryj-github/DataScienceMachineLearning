Mr. Oh\n>>and Mr. Jung are currently detained at a police\n>>station in Seoul; in a few days, they will be\n>>relocated to another jail where they will await\n>>sentencing. Korea\\u2019s consitution does not\n>>recognize a permit system for rallies; only a\n>>notice needs to be given, which we have done so\n>>without fail. We, the Korean Alliance, thus\n>>feel that their arrests are a direct violation\n>>of democratic and constitutional right to\n>>assemble and express our opinion. Since its\n>>formation in March 2006, the Korean Alliance\n>>has organized peaceful and legal demonstrations\n>>against what we think is a seriously unjust\n>>agreement for the people of Korea, the U.S.,\n>>and the world. However, since November 2006,\n>>the Roh Moo-hyun Administration has declared\n>>all Korean Alliance\\u2019s public rallies illegal.\n>>Police suppression has been severe on all\n>>activities of the Korean Alliance. We believe\n>>that the Roh Moo-hyun Administration has\n>>gravely violated fundamental rights of the\n>>people to assemble and oppose any unjust government practices.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>Mr. Oh was born in 1938 in the city of Kwangju.\n>>He helped establish the Korean Teachers and\n>>Education Workers\\u2019 Union, for which he was\n>>imprisoned. He has worked tirelessly for\n>>democracy, unification, and the abolition of\n>>Korea\\u2019s National Security Law, the latter for\n>>which he was again imprisoned. Mr. Jung was\n>>born in 1939 in the city of Haenam. He has been\n>>active in the democratic movement to demand\n>>government responsibility, for which he was\n>>imprisoned for 4 years. He has served as\n>>President of the Korean Peasants\\u2019 League, the\n>>national federation of small farmers\\u2019\n>>organizations. He has for years led the\n>>farmers\\u2019 movement against the WTO and free trade.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>Call for International Protest Letter\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>We ask the international community to carefully\n>>consider the situation of Korea.

We write this urgent letter\n>>to demand 1) the immediate release of Mr. Oh\n>>Jong-ryul and Mr. Jung Gwang-hoon, two\n>>Co-Chairs of the Korean Alliance and 2) an\n>>immediate end to police suppression of the Korean Alliance.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>First, the arrests of Mr. Oh and Mr. Jung are a\n>>direct violation of basic democratic principles\n>>and constitutional rights. We believe that\n>>South Korea is a democratic nation that\n>>guarantees, under the constitution, the right\n>>to associate and oppose unjust practices of\n>>ruling authority. These rights are fundamental\n>>to any democratic nation, and we strongly feel\n>>that today's arrests may represent a\n>>retrogression of Korea's status as a democratic\n>>nation. In addition, the police\\u2019s disregard\n>>for their old age and health conditions shows a sign of inhumane treatment.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>Second, their arrests are an infringement of\n>>international principles of political and civil\n>>rights. As a member of the United Nations,\n>>South Korea has signed on to connventions that\n>>protect and promote the advancement of social\n>>freedom and human rights. South Korea has made\n>>important democratic strides since the 1970s.\n>>We have witnessed this transformation. We urge\n>>the Roh Moo-hyun Administration, elected by\n>>democratic means, to not forget Korea\\u2019s\n>>history and to foster international and\n>>democratic principles. The rights of the people\n>>to assemble and express their voices must be protected.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>And third, we demand an immediate end of police\n>>suppression against the Korean Alliance. We are\n>>aware that South Korea\\u2019s constitution\n>>(Article 21) does not recognize a permit system\n>>for rallies; only notices need to be given,\n>>which the Korean Alliance has done without\n>>fail. Therefore, we believe that the activities\n>>of the Korean Alliance is by no means illegal.\n>>The police suppression of FTA protests, which\n>>we have seen in the media, is shocking. The\n>>fact that the Korean Alliance\\u2019s activities\n>>are singled out and determined as illegal\n>>indicates a direct attack against a people\\u2019s\n>>organization and an obvious violation of Korea\\u2019s constitution.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>We disapprove the decisions made by the Roh\n>>Moo-hyun Administration on the officers and\n>>activities of the Korean Alliance. Along with\n>>the recent suppression of Korean auto workers,\n>>we fear that the suppression of the Korean\n>>Alliance signals a dangerous digressive trend\n>>in Korea\\u2019s democracy. If this trend\n>>continues, we can promise the Administration\n>>that the international community will not sit\n>>still.
