In a two-class case\nit's quite simple by calculating the TP, TN, FP, FN rates once but in the\nmulti-class case I have to do it as often as there exist different\nclasses (for each class).\nOf course I could do it manually in a for-loop or so. But is there a\nmore convenient way? Perhaps on the basis of a confusion table?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nChristian Schaefer\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
