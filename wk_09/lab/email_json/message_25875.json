Here is an example:\n\n  n <- length(year.month)\n  plot( 1:n, freq, xaxt=\"n\")\n  mtext( text=year.month, side=1, at=1:n, las=2 )\n\n\nb) or create the dates in Date format. This option is preferable if the \ndates were varying unequally.\n\n  x <- seq( as.Date(\"2000-05-01\"), as.Date(\"2002-12-01\"), by=\"1 month\" )\n  plot(x, simulation$freq)\n\n\nBTW, you could also have created year.month via\n   paste( rep( 2000:2002, c(8,12,12) ),\n          formatC( c(5:12,1:12,1:12), width=2, flag=\"0\" ) , sep=\"_\" )\n\n\nRegards, Adai\n\n\n\n\nMilton Cezar Ribeiro wrote:\n> Dear all,\n> \n> I have two data frame, on with a complete list of my field survey with frequency data of a sample species.
