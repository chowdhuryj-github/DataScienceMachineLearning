I thought ASCAP is collecting without the \nneed for exclusive rights from the artist?\n\nIf you know the answer, I would also be very happy if you could point me \nto some creditable sources.\n\nThanks!\n\nAll the best,\n\ngrtz\nBjornW\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
