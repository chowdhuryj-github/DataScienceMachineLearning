That will shut off Speakup for only that console and you're good\nto go. You can then have the other consoles talking with no\nproblems. The only side effect is that you'll have to cancel the\nscreen capture dialog, so don't do this until after Orca is running :) \n-- \nBuddy Brannan, KB5ELV\nEmail: buddy@brannan.name or phone 888-75-BUDDY\nGet a free online mall and earn on 1000 stores:\nhttp://www.powermall.us\n>From Kitchen Disaster to Culinary Master, make meals and baking \neasier and faster: http://www.tastyshop.net\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
