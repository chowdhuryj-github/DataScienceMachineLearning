The theme of Oprah's show is the one film you must see this summer -- \"Sicko\" -- and the one book you must read (Warwic McCarthy's \"The Road\"). Oprah loved Michael's film and wants to make health care for all one of her main missions this year.\n\n\nSo set your recorders for Oprah tomorrow, Tuesday!\n\n\n\n\n---\nYou are currently subscribed to Mike's Message as: ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca\n\nTo unsubscribe click on the link below:\n\nhttp://go.netatlantic.com/u?id=52827208F&l=michaelmoore\n\n\n"}
