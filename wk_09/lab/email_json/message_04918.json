In October 1997, \n      31-year-old Heather Grossman and her husband, John, were fired on in their \n      car at an intersection in broad daylight. It was clearly an attempted \n      execution of a wealthy and socially prominent couple. The bullet that \n      struck John only grazed him, but another bullet severed Heather' spinal \n      cord, leaving her a quadriplegic. Today, she is still confined to a \n      wheelchair. And there is no chance of rehabilitation. Of course, the \n      question on everyone's mind was who would want to kill this attractive \n      mother of three and her second husband? Who would orchestrate and then \n      carry out this drive-by shooting... and why? In quick order investigators \n      found the shooter and three other men who confessed about their roles in \n      the scheme. They were drug addicts and petty thieves. Surprisingly, they \n      didn't know Heather Grossman or her husband. And they weren't looking to \n      rob the couple. During interrogation all four men told the same story. \n      They were given orders to kill Heather Grossman. As investigators kept \n      digging, the murder for hire plot began unraveling and all the evidence \n      seemed to lead to one conclusion. It would take nearly a decade for this \n      mystery to be resolved... and for the architect behind this devastating \n      shooting to be brought to justice. You will hear from everyone involved in \n      this explosive case... the victim, the shooter and the person who was \n      convicted for pulling the strings... in the next 48 Hours \n      Mystery.\" - Troy Roberts\n(48 Hours Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT)\nIf you would like more information on any of these stories or the \n      broadcast, please click on the following address and e-mail us at: \n      48hours@cbsnews.com \n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWSHere is \n      an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING \n      NEWS... Hi everyone. This is Harry Smith, \n      filling in for Katie. It has been nine days since Don Imus \n      made the inflammatory on-air comments about the Rutgers women's basketball \n      team and now he has been fired by CBS. His career might be in dire \n      straits, but he did get a hint of redemption from the young basketball \n      players, who have accepted his apology. Could all this fury perhaps lead \n      to a more civil tone in American media? Nancy Cordes will have the \n      story. We'll also give you an update on New Jersey Gov. Jon \n      Corzine, who was badly injured in a car crash on the Garden State Parkway \n      while en route to mediating the meeting between Imus and the women's \n      basketball team. Pakistan's president Pervez Musharraf is facing \n      his harshest criticism since 9/11 for not doing more to fight terrorism. \n      Despite that the Taliban threat seems to be growing on both sides of his \n      country's border with Afghanistan, Musharraf defends his efforts. Our \n      Chief Foreign Correspondent Lara Logan sat down with Musharraf and \n      tonight we'll share her interview with you. (And later you'll be able to \n      see the whole interview online at CBSNews.com.) Back in America, \n      Jim Axelrod will report on one of the frontrunners for the GOP \n      presidential nomination: Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor \n      has worked hard to portray himself as a Washington outsider and has had \n      great success fundraising. But will voters warm up to his religion? \n      Sixty years ago this Sunday, Jackie Robinson broke baseball's \n      color barrier. Tonight, Cynthia Bowers will introduce you to a man \n      who, nearly 50 years ago, wrote letters of admiration to Jackie. What's \n      amazing: Jackie wrote back. We will share some of his correspondence with \n      you. Finally, Steve Hartman will have for Assignment \n      America the story of Arnold Blume, a man who may be the country's \n      oldest substitute teacher. I hope you'll join us and have a \n      great weekend.
