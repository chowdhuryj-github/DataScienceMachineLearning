It should be basename.xmp (no dot prepended)\nI don't know where this convention comes from but definitely not the one\nfrom the current (non-free) implementations.\nI'd rather wish we don't reinvent the wheel.\n\n> How does the patch look?

Actually xmp_terminate() isn't mandatory as when the\nprogramm quits, things will be cleaned up.\n\nAnd the CC namespace of XMP is defined in the library. It is NS_CC. This\nis cosmetic, but ensure that we use the right string.\n\n\nHub\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
