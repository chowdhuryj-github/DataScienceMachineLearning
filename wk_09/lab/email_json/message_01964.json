However \"return unless -M $_ < 3;\" won't work correctly either as\nit means that you are moving files that are *newer* not *older* than three\ndays.  Also you are using the directory() rule which means that only\ndirectorys are moved, not files.\n\n\n\nJohn\n-- \nPerl isn't a toolbox, but a small machine shop where you can special-order\ncertain sorts of tools at low cost and in short order.       -- Larry Wall\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
