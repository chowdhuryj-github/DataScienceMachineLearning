It does not\nmaintain a list of which files belong to which installations, and will happily\nlet two installations both write to the same file.  This will be problematic\nwhen you want to remove one of those installations later.\n\nIf you want package management, you'll have to use a distribution (like many\nLinux and BSD distributions) that have taken the extra time to \"package\" the\nCPAN distributions.  That has its own downsides, of course.\n\n-- \nRandal L.
