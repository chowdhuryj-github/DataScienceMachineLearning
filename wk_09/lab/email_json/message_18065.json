If it doesn't come back, you never had it. If it comes back, love it forever.\n\nAn old thing becomes new if you detach it from what usually surrounds it.\n\nYou have to expect things of yourself before you can do them.\n\nIn the long run, free trade benefits everyone in the short run it is bound to produce much pain.\n\n\n"}
