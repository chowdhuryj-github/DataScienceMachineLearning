Many algorithms can be\nshared b/w them; however, some necessary data preprocessing is\nrequired for text mining. There are a lot of online-resource there.\n\nAs to packages used for text mining in R, esp. for preprocessing,\nplease check the following link:\nhttp://wwwpeople.unil.ch/jean-pierre.mueller/\n\nI used that package very long time ago and am not sure if they are\nupdated for this current version of R; otherwise, you might need to go\nback the old version like R1.1.\n\nIf you want to do text mining for chinese text (I guess :), there is\nadditional work (i.e. word splitting) needed. I remember there is some\nresearcher from Taiwan who does pretty good work and you can google\nthat. I cannot remember the details.\n\nHTH,\n\nWeiwei\n\n\nOn 6/8/07, Ruixin ZHU  wrote:\n> Dear R-user,\n>\n> Could anybody tell me of the key difference between data mining and text\n> mining?\n> Please make a list for packages about data/text mining.\n> And give me an example of text mining with R (any relating materials\n> will be highly appreciated), because a vignette written by Ingo Feinerer\n> seems too concise for me.\n>\n> Thanks\n> _____________________________________________\n> Dr.Ruixin ZHU\n> Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology\n> rxzhu@scbit.org\n> zhurx@mail.sioc.ac.cn\n> 86-21-13040647832\n>\n>\n>         [[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n\n-- \nWeiwei Shi, Ph.D\nResearch Scientist\nGeneGO, Inc.\n\n\"Did you always know?\"\n\"No, I did not.
