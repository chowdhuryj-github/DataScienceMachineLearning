First of all you should make sure that your R\ncode can't be made any faster. (I've seen cases where careful\nre-writes increased speed by a factor of 10 or more.) There are some\nrules (such as pre-allocate enough memory for vectors/lists, use\nmatrices instead of data frames etc) and tools (?Rprof, ?Sys.time)\nthat can help a lot. Check the manuals and the archives, for example\nhttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.general/48800\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Robert McFadden\n> Sent: Tuesday, June 19, 2007 4:51 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] Speed up R\n>\n> Dear R Users,\n> I hope that there is someone who has an experience with a\n> problem that I\n> describe below and will help me.\n> I must buy new desktop computer and I'm wondering which\n> processor to choose\n> if my only aim is to speed up R.
