An overnight forecast continues to predict a chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles of the Kennedy Space Center that could cause problems. But the forecast for the first two of three opportunities at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., calls for windy but acceptable conditions. The winds are expected to build up as the day wears on, and forecasters believe the third and final California landing opportunity will be out of limits. The shuttle has enough supplies to stay in orbit until Sunday in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston plans to brief entry flight director Norm Knight around 9 a.m. An updated forecast will be posted here as soon as it is available. In the meantime, here is an updated list of all the day's landing opportunities (in EDT and mission elapsed time):\n\n\nDAY...EDT..........DD...HH...MM...SS...EVENT\n\n06/22/07\nFri\u00a0 01:12:34 PM...13...17...34...30...KSC: Deorbit on rev 218\nFri\u00a0 02:18:30 PM...13...18...40...26...KSC: Landing\n\nFri\u00a0 02:43:39 PM...13...19...05...35...EDW: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:49:54 PM...13...20...11...50...EDW: Landing\n\nFri\u00a0 02:50:31 PM...13...19...12...27...KSC: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:55:00 PM...13...20...16...56...KSC: Landing\n\nFri\u00a0 04:18:38 PM...13...20...40...34...EDW: Deorbit on rev 220\nFri\u00a0 05:23:44 PM...13...21...45...40...EDW: Landing\n\nFri\u00a0 05:56:31 PM...13...22...18...27...EDW: Deorbit on rev 221\nFri\u00a0 06:59:51 PM...13...23...21...47...EDW: Landing\n\nAdditional entry information is posted on NASA's STS-117 Landing Ground Tracks page:\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts117/main/landing.html\n\nSee the 11:12 p.m. status report for detailed entry timelines.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
