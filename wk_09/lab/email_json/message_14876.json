Such as\n-5 to be +5\nI tried +(-5), but that didn't work.\n\nSo no, I don't mean taking a -5^2 just to get a positive number.\nThis is in a function so it's not just -5 it's x. :)\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul\n\n-- \nResearch Technician\nMass Spectrometry\n   o The\n  /\no Scripps\n  \\\n   o Research\n  /\no Institute\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
