Some\nnotes worth reporting:\n\nThe Debian pre-4.0 release had problems seeing the SATA drive.  The Debian\n4.0 release on DVD (from CheapBytes.com) is corrupted.  I went with the\nnet-install and everything was fine.\n\nThe wireless card (IPW3945) was a pain to get running.  Once I broke the\ncode as it were, networking was fine.\n\nHP 6980 InkJet printer runs well.  Via Samba, I also connect to a HP\nLaserJet 1320.  Also runs fine.\n\nThe machine does just what I want---it is loaded with Mathematica, Matlab,\nand Maple, all of which installed without a hitch.\n\nAnyone with this machine is welcome to drop me a line if he/she has any\nproblems with the Debian install/configuration.\n\nJack\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
