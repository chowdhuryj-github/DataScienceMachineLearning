Is this possible?\n\nI don't know of a way to directly pass a variable from one script to\nanother. However, you could easily enough pass it in as a command line\nargument. Call the second script like\n\nperl /path/to/script2.pl variable\n\nAnd in script two, do something like\n\nmy $argument = shift | die \"no argument given\";\n\nI'm sure TIMTOWTDI though.\n\n>\n>\n>\n> First program uses this line to queue the job\n>\n>\n>\n> system \"/usr/bin/at $hour:$minute $tod today < /var/www/cgi-bin/images\";\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> images is a text file containing the perl program that runs the FTP\n> download:\n>\n>\n>\n> perl /var/www/cgi-bin/get_image_file.pl\n>\n>\n>\n>  Is there a way to pass a variable from program 1 to program 2?\n>\n>\n>\n> Thanks for your help!!\n>\n>\n>\n> Brian Volk\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n\n\n-- \n-- \nI'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
