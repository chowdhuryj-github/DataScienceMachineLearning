If you are trying to test something specific (like an activity), and you are pretty sure that it is a reproducable bug in that component, please go ahead and write up a bug in trac.\nIf, on the other hand, you really don't know if it is a problem with sugar, or the x driver, or something in journal or mesh that may be affecting all activities, then add your note to this wiki page and we'll try to get a resolution.\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/index.php?title=Test_Group_Release_NotesDevelopers -- if you know of an issue and are working on it, it would be great if you wanted to add a note so the test group knows this is being addressed.\nWithin a couple of days (when the build is working a little more) then we'll get rid of this page and just ask everyone to put bugs into trac.Current Trial-2 build is 466: \nhttp://olpc.download.redhat.com/olpc/streams/development/build466/Thanks!Kim\n"}
