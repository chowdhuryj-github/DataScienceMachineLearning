For Debian's r-cran-rgtk2 (which you could install from\nUbuntu, albeit in a slightly older version, via 'sudo apt-get install\nr-cran-rgtk2'), I use the following Build-Depends:\n\n  libgtk2.0-dev (>= 2.10.12-1), libglade2-dev, libpango1.0-dev, libcairo2-dev\n \nIf you have all that installed, it should just work fine (and I do use the\ndirect-from-CRAN method on my computers at work, and have just upgraded RGtk2\nthere a few days ago).\n\n| I am using  R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18) on a Ubuntu 7.04 system\n\nFYI there are Ubuntu backports at CRAN. You could get R 2.5.0 without any\neffort, and presumably in a few days R 2.5.1 once the porters build the\npackage as I've put 2.5.1 into Debian.\n\nHth, Dirk\n\n-- \nHell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something. \n                                                  -- Thomas A.
