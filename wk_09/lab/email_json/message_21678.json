Should you run into an obstacle that is preventing you from realizing one of your dreams, take out your journal and read down the list of things you wrote and you will feel a force of positive energy surge through your body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remember above all, it is the person you become, and not the things you achieve or the things you acquire that is most important.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Universe is on your side now.\u00a0 You are moving forward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As always, Bethea and I are here to help you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until next week,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nP.S.
