Can I compile a module on one box and somehow install\nthe code on another?\nMight this be as simple as copying over the contents of the directories\nin @INC?\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n\nrichf\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
