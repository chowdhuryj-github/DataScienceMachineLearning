For example (assuming your Null Hypothesis\nis that p = 0.5, which is the default, and your Alternative\nHypothesis is that p > 0.5):\n\n  binom.test(x=59, n=100,alternative=\"greater\")\n\n        Exact binomial test\n\n  data:  59 and 100 \n  number of successes = 59, number of trials = 100, p-value = 0.04431\n  alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater\n    than 0.5 \n  95 percent confidence interval:\n    0.5028918 1.0000000 \n  sample estimates:\n  probability of success \n                    0.59 \n\n(which confirms that your \"divide by two\" strategy was about right\nin this case, though that will not always be true; and certainly\nwill not be appropriate for the opposite Alternative Hypothesis\nthat p < 0.5).\n\n> However, the journal to which I've\n> submitted my results requests the test statistics, not just the \n> P-values. How can I make R return the test statistics?\n\n2: Have a word (et borgerlig ord, as the Danes say -- sorry\nI do not have the same familiarity with Swedish, but maybe you\nsay the same) with the journal editor.\n\nThe plain and simple fact is that the data (x = 59 out of n = 100)\nconstitue the test statistic. In the conditional context that\nn=100, the test statistic is simply x = 59.\n\nHowever, one should strictly speaking always include a statement\nabout n, no matter how one expresses the test statistic. For instance,\nyou might use t = x/n as test statistic (with expectation p=0.5\nand SD sqrt( p*(1-p)/n ) in your case). While its expecation now\ndepends only on the NH (p = 0.5), it cannot be evaluated as a test\nwithout knowldge of n since that is needed to get the SD.\n\nSo R (see above) has indeed returned the \"test statistic\", and\nthe journal is not being reasonable!\n\nHoping this helps,\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 14-May-07                                       Time: 11:57:19\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
