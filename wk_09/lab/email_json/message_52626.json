I don't know anything about \nJapanese, but I do vaguely remember from high school that, for Chinese \ntexts, there are often no spaces between words and the reader's \nknowledge of the language allows him or her to infer the word separations.\n\nHowever, even without knowing Japanese, we might be able to help you \nfind acceptable solutions. What is your program supposed to do?\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
