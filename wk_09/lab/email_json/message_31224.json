While FEMA may\n  have helped shelter a lot of families, our investigative team has discovered\n  that the trailers may be toxic to the people who call them home.\n  Investigative Correspondent Armen Keteyian will report.\n\u00a0\nSharyl Attkisson is also reporting from the Gulf Coast.\n  Tonight she\u2019ll have an update on New\n    Orleans and the surrounding area \u2013 how far has\n  it really come since Katrina?\n\u00a0\nIn South\n    Carolina last night, Republican Presidential\n  candidates took the stage for their second debate. As our senior political\n  correspondent Jeff Greenfield will report, there were more than a few sparks.\n  He\u2019ll have the highlights.\n\u00a0\nIn health news, we\u2019ll look into the Internet\n  and its growing role as a place to find prescription drugs.

The catch: kids don\u2019t need\n  a parent\u2019s go-ahead before adding charges their bill. Richard\n  Schlesinger will have the story as well as some solutions.\n\u00a0\nFinally, we\u2019ve got a story about possible\n  Irish roots popping up in an unlikely spot in American politics. According to\n  members of one little church on the Emerald Isle, records show a potential\n  genealogical connection to the 2008 presidential race. I\u2019ll give you a\n  hint \u2013 his surname isn\u2019t O\u2019Malley or O\u2019Connor, but it\n  does start with an \u201cO.\u201d \n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
