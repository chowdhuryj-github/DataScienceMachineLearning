(http://www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=3218) the AACS  LA\nis not claiming that the number  above is copyrighted, but rather that\nit  is  \"a technology, product,   service, device, component,  or part\nthereof that  is primarily  designed,  produced, or  marketed  for the\npurpose of circumventing the technological protection measures\", which\nAACS can be arguably construed as.\n\nAccording to Italian copyright law I see no reason why a number could\nnot be copyrighted, if it is the result of a creative activity. But I\nbelive this is a different issue.\n\nBest,\n\n--\n      Andrea Glorioso || http://people.digitalpolicy.it/sama/cv/\n          M: +39 348 921 4379\t     F: +39 051 930 31 133\n       \"Truth is a relationship between a theory and the world;\n       beauty is a relationship between a theory and the mind.\"\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
