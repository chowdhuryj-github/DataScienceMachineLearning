If I have\nwindows set to \"automatically adjust clock for Daylight Savings changes\"\nthen in R I get the following\n\n> as.POSIXct(\"2006-03-12 01:05:00 EST5EDT\",tz=\"EST\")\n[1] \"2006-03-12 01:05:00 EST\"\n> as.POSIXct(\"2006-03-12 03:05:00 EST5EDT\",tz=\"EST\")\n[1] \"2006-03-12 02:05:00 EST\"\n\nIf I uncheck the \"automatically adjust clock for Daylight Savings\" checkbox\nI get\n\n> as.POSIXct(\"2006-03-12 01:05:00 EST5EDT\",tz=\"EST\")\n[1] \"2006-03-12 01:05:00 EST\"\n> as.POSIXct(\"2006-03-12 03:05:00 EST5EDT\",tz=\"EST\")\n[1] \"2006-03-12 03:05:00 EST\"\n\nAll of which makes my head hurt.  At least now I can read the query with\nas.is=TRUE  and set the tz explicitly.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
