Similarly, if you distribute physical hardware containing GPL\ncode, you must obey the same requirements (to provide source on a\nCDROM, etc, or give a written offer to provide source on a CDROM etc).\nAnd that's okay but, as you say, not ideal.\n\nSo I prefer the GPLv3 drafts (in sec. 6) because they allow Internet\ndistribution of the source, even when the object code or executable is\ndistributed in a physical medium (e.g. a printed manual or a router).\n\n-Sanjoy\n\n`If we are fortunate, Republicans will complete their self-destruction\n before they extinguish the Constitution and destroy America.' \n   --Paul Roberts, former assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
