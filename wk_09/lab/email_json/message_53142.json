You might consider adding a\nline to the POD which indicates why this test is necessary, given the\nfact that the user already has Perl 5.  (It is because packaging systems\ncan and do offer minimalist Perl 5 packages that omit 'perldoc'.)\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
