I would like to obtain seasonal statistics of regular\ntime-series and for example look at the result of the plot.seas.var()\nfunction or use the change function() to look at change between periods\nor time-series.\n\n \n\nThe nottem time-series are similar to the time-series we are analyzing\n(but with data frequency=46 instead of 12 of the nottem dataset).  We\nhave year and day of year available but not the date (-> is there a\nfunction to derive a date format such as e.g. 01-01-2007 from day 1,\nyear 2007?)\n\n \n\n> \n\nnottem\n\nplot(nottem)\n\n \n\n \n\nI couldn't find anything about this on the R discussion - or www. \n\n \n\nThanks and cheers,\n\nJan\n\n \n\nComp Specs are R 2.5, win XP.\n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
