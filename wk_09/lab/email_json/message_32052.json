The expected \ndistribution of the test statistic is approximately chi-squared with \n2df, regardless of values of estimated parameters or sample size \n(provided sample size is sufficiently large).\n\nPetr's reply:\n\n>Maybe it is easier and sufficient to use the Kolmogorov - Smirnov \n>test, that is implemented as ks.test() in R.

Am I missing something?\n\nThanks again.\n\nSean\n\n********************************************\n>>Sean R.
