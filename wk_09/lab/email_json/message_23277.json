Good to know that things have improved.\n\n> If you want to use suspend2, you musto to patch and build a new kernel.\n\nI would rather use uswsusp and not patch the kernel.\n\nRight now I have the following two packages installed: hibernate and uswsusp. The hibernate package description says that it supports both suspend2 and /sys/power/state. Am I correct to assume that uswsusp uses neither? I want to make sure \"just in case\" and because by default the laptop task installs hibernate. The last thing I need is a corrupt partition.\n\nThank you for the generous replies. They helped a lot!\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble? Contact listmaster@lists.debian.org\n\n"}
