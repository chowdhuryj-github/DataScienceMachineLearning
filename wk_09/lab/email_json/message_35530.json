My name is Hermann, and I live in Germany. I use \nLinux for four years, almost all the time text Linux, with a 6 months \ninterlude with Gnome and Orca.\nToday I set up Speakup on my Ubuntu Feisty and explored it by reading teh \nusers guide. I'm impressed of the program, but there's one thing I couldn't \nfigure out, cursor parking.\nMaybe I missed it in the guide, but what does \"parking\" do and in which \ncases is it useful?\nThanks for your patience with a beginner.\nRegards\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
