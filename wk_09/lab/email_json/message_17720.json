The automobile is widely to have changed the\nof our cities, shifted ownership and retail trade altered sexual customs and\nloosened family ties. the Middle East, the rapid spread of radios is\ncredited with having contributed to resurgence of Arab nationalism. The\nbirth control the computer, the space effort, well as the and diffusion of\n\"soft\" technologies as systems analysis, have carried significant changes in\ntheir wake. We can no \nafford to let such secondary social cultural effects just \"happen.\" We\nattempt to anticipate them in estimating, to the degree their nature,\nstrength timing. Where these are likely to be seriously damaging, we also be\nprepared to block new technology. It is as as that. Technology cannot be\npermitted to through the society. It is quite true that can never know all\nthe effects any action, technological \notherwise. But it is not true that are helpless. It is, for example,\nsometimes to test new technology in limited among limited groups, its\nsecondary impacts before releasing it diffusion. We could, if we\nimaginative, devise living experiments, even volunteer communities, help\nguide our technological decisions. Just as may wish to create enclaves the\npast where the rate of change artificially slowed, or enclaves the future in\nwhich can pre-sample future environments, we may wish to set aside, even\nsubsidize, \nhigh-novelty communities in advanced drugs, power vehicles, cosmetics,\nappliances and other innovations experimentally used and investigated. A\ntoday will routinely field test product make sure it its primary function.\nThe same company will test the product to ascertain it will sell. But, with\nexception, no one post-checks the or the community to determine \nthe human side effects been. Survival in the future depend on our learning\nto do when life-testing proves unfeasible, it is still for us systematically\nto anticipate the effects of various technologies. scientists are rapidly\nnew tools, from mathematical and simulation to so-called Delphi that permit\nus to make more judgments about the consequences our actions.
