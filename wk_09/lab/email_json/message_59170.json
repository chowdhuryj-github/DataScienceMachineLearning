When a program is dual-licensed under\nGPL-2 or \"any later version\", you can adhere to GPL-3 for the purpose of\ncompliing with Section 1 (or whatever section it is in GPL-3), without this\npreventing our users from adhering to GPL-2 if they wish.\n\n(IANAL, etc)\n\n-- \nRobert Millan\n\nMy spam trap is honeypot@aybabtu.com.
