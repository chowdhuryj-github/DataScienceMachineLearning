The products were two antiretrovirals, Kaletra\n(Abbott's ritonavir plus lopinavir) and Stocrin (Merck & Co's efavirenz),\nand the cardiovascular therapy Plavix (Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi-Aventis's\nclopidogrel).\n\nHowever, in a letter to US Trade Representative Susan Schwab, Mr Waxman, who\nis also chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform, and\nhis colleagues argue that Thailand acted within international rights and\nobligations under the TRIPS Agreement, which have been affirmed by the US\nand other nations in the Doha Declaration.\n\nIt says the USTR's decision \"sends a troubling message, not only to Thailand\nbut to the whole world, that the exercise of recognised public health\nflexibilities in trade obligations is frowned upon by the US\".\n\nThe letter points out that each of the compulsory licences only applied to\nthe non-commercial government use, therefore Thailand was under no\nobligation to consult with patent holders. However, Thailand did make\nconcerted efforts to negotiate lower prices with the patent-holders, it\nadds.\n\nIt also adds that without the compulsory licences Thailand would not be able\nto join other low to middle income countries in maintaining and expanding\nits AIDS treatment programme.\n\nFurthermore, the letter stresses that under the Doha Declaration, each\ncountry \"'has the right to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to\ndetermine the grounds upon which such licences are granted.' Yet now, the US\nappears to have acted on the complaints of Abbott and others.\"\n\nbig pharma\nThe letter was welcomed by activist groups. Robert Weissman, director of\nEssential Action, said the letter \"reflected growing sentiment in Congress\nthat US policy on access to medicines questions must change. The emerging\nview is that developing countries must be permitted to take legal measures\nto reduce the price of medicines and make them more widely available.\n\n\"These members of Congress recognize that the US government damages the\nnation's commitments, reputation, aspirations and legitimate national\ninterest when it reflexively adopts Big Pharma's agenda overseas.\"\n\nThe USTR has been given until July 9th to respond to the letter.\n\nFull Title: SCRIP - World Pharmaceutical News - http://www.scripnews.com\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
