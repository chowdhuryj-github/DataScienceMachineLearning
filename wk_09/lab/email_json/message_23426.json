If I use this option does it run in it's most\nstrongest mode fixing all errors or is that just a check with no fixes?  I\nhad to use a rescue mode CD to run fsck on /dev/hda1 as my jurnal some how\ngot messed up and mount would not mount it, that is why I am asking this\nquestion as if fsck runs first, I did not see any messages about it\nrunning, I think it was in the initrd.  It was just after speakup started\ntalking, the system frose.  What is the best way to fix the jurnal with\nout using another CD?\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
