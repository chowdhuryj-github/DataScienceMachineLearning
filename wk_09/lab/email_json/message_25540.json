I can\nnot use the plot.ts function as time steps between 2 measurements are\nvariables. I don't want to do a plot.ts as time steps are variable and also\nas I\nwould like the different times to be written on the x-axis.I also would\nlike space\nbetween each time step on the x-axis to be representativ of the real\namount of time.\n\nHere is a example\n\ntime<-c(\"2004-10-18 17:20:00\",\"2004-10-18 17:50:00\" ,\"2004-10-18\n18:40:00\",\"2004-10-18 19:50:00\",\"2004-10-18 20:00:00\" ,\"2004-10-18\n20:10:00\",\"2004-10-18 21:20:00\" ,\"2004-10-18 22:00:00\" ,\"2004-10-18\n23:40:00\")\n\n(is it automatically recognized as a time format?)\n\nprecipitation<-c(0.1,0.5,0.0,0.8,1,2,5,0.2,3)\n\nplot(time,precipitation)\nError in plot.window(xlim, ylim, log, asp, ...) :\n        need finite 'xlim' values\nIn addition: Warning messages:\n1: NAs introduced by coercion\n2: no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n3: no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\n\nDo anyone knows how to plot this kind os time dependant datas ?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRegards,\n\nJessica\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
