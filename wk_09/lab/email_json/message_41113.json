Right now\nI do not think there is much of a threat of music piracy as a revenue\ndrain, as it stands, piracy unimpeded has had many positive effects\nand, to some extent, has inserted fans into the creation process in a\nway they haven't previously been, for better or for worse.\n\nbest\nc\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
