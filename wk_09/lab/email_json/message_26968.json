It provides estimates for\nconditional class probabilities which can then be used to predict class\nlabels. I know there is Polyclass package in S-plus. So I'm wondering if\nthere is a corresponding package in R? I have been searching for it for\nquite a while, but still haven't found it. You help is appreciated very\nmuch!\n\n \n\nBest regards\n\n \n\nFeng\n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
