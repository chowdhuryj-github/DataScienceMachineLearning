You have ssh access to\nthe box (otherwise you wouldn't want the module), so download the\nmodule to a local machine and scp it over.  If the reason isn't really\nnetwork restrictions, but rather sysadmins who don't want new Perl\nmodules installed on \"their\" box, you can always install the module in\nthe directory of the user who is going to run the code.  If this still\nfreaks out your sysadmins, well, you are stuck with puppet stringing\nthe ssh command through IPC::Open3* (which is part of core Perl, so\nthey can't complain).\n\n* http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/lib/IPC/Open3.pm\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
