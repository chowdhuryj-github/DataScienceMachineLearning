Consumers\nwill do these actions themselves providing a network of\ndistribution that is costless to them, but has greater\nrange, speed, convenience, and intelligence than\ndistribution through cds on store shelves.\n\n \n\nBackups would be unnecessary:  \n\nIf you lose your copy simply download another copy from\nour site or from someone else.\n\n \n\nCDs providing value to fans:\n\nCDs compared to online downloads have little value.  The\nartwork and other materials that have traditionally been\npackaged with CDs are media in themselves and can be\ncreated through other proposals or included in a single\nproposal along with the music.  If someone would like to\nburn the music to CD, print the album art and other\nsupplements, and put the together, they are free to do so.\n\n \n\n \n\nYours,\n\nBrandt Cannici\n\nFounder\n\nwww.strayform.com\n\nConnect, Commission, Create\n\n\n--- cc-community-request@lists.ibiblio.org wrote:\n\n> Send cc-community mailing list submissions to\n> \tcc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\n> \n> To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web,\n> visit\n> \n> http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n> or, via email, send a message with subject or body\n> 'help' to\n> \tcc-community-request@lists.ibiblio.org\n> \n> You can reach the person managing the list at\n> \tcc-community-owner@lists.ibiblio.org\n> \n> When replying, please edit your Subject line so it\n> is more specific\n> than \"Re: Contents of cc-community digest...\"\n> \n> \n> Today's Topics:\n> \n>    1.
