I have to loop though the rows in\nthe matrix and create DIFFERENT matrices each time I go through the loop.\n\ncounts=c(4,6,10);\n\np=1;\nfor (i in 1:length(counts))\n{\n\n    smat=bmat[p:p+i-1,];\n    p=p+i;\n}\n\nThe problem is smat overwrites itself each time inside the loop. I would\nlike to have smat1, smat2, smat3 instead of a single vector smat. Basically\nI wanted to change the name of the matrix \"smat\" each time the loop runs so\nthat i will have 3 different matrices.\n\nAny help will be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nSuman\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
