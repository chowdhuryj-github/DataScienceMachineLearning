Since Leopard Server can compile and run \nall your existing UNIX 03-compliant code, it can be deployed in \nenvironments that demand full conformance. At the same time, Mac OS X \nServer provides full compatibility with existing server and application \nsoftware.\"\n\nSo it seems like this Darwin specific fix will be non-necessary in 10.5 \nthough it should still work.\n\nDid any of the Samba team go to the WWDC and get a copy of Leopard?\n\nNeal\n\n"}
