This\none works almost perfect now, except the seperate wheel between the\nbuttons does not work anymore. I can choose to use the synaptics driver\nto use all touchpad specific features (including scrolling on the right\nor bottom edges for vertical and horizontal movement) without the\nseperate wheel working, or to use the normal mouse driver, without\ntochpad specific features but the wheel works. Somehow annoying.\n\nI played around a bit with the xorg.conf, several device sections,\nseveral orders of them, several options, several devices used\n(from /dev/psaux to udev style /dev/input/*, different button statements\n(from 5 up to 11), with and without ZAxisMapping, and nothing seems to\nwork. So either the wheel with driver mouse or with driver \"synaptics\"\nwith emulated wheel on the pads edges... not both at the same time. If I\nstart xev with driver synaptics loaded I even don't get any events for\nthe wheel.\n\nAny ideas? Any help is appreciated! As a starting point I paste my\ntouchpad section underneath.\n\ngreetings\nMichael\n\nP.S.: as a side note, I use sometimes an USB mouse, this mouse works\ntoo, I just neeed to add another device section with /dev/input/mice as\ndevice.\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n       Driver          \"synaptics\"\n       Identifier      \"ALPS Touchpad\"\n       Option          \"Protocol\"      \"auto-dev\"\n       Option          \"Device\"        \"/dev/input/mouse1\"\n       Option          \"LeftEdge\"      \"150\"\n       Option          \"RightEdge\"     \"900\"\n       Option          \"TopEdge\"       \"170\"\n       Option          \"BottomEdge\"    \"680\"\n       Option          \"FingerLow\"     \"25\"\n       Option          \"FingerHigh\"    \"30\"\n       Option          \"MaxTapTime\"    \"180\"\n       Option          \"MaxTapMove\"    \"110\"\n       Option          \"EmulateMidButtonTime\"  \"75\"\n       Option          \"VertScrollDelta\"       \"50\"\n       Option          \"HorizScrollDelta\"      \"50\"\n       Option          \"MinSpeed\"      \"0.35\"\n       Option          \"MaxSpeed\"      \"0.75\"\n       Option          \"AccelFactor\"   \"0.15\"\n       Option          \"EdgeMotionMinSpeed\"    \"500\"\n       Option          \"EdgeMotionMaxSpeed\"    \"500\"\n       Option          \"RTCornerButton\"        \"3\"\n       Option          \"LTCornerButton\"        \"2\"\n       Option          \"LockedDrags\"           \"0\"\n       Option          \"UpDownScrolling\"       \"1\"\n       Option          \"TouchPadOff\"           \"Off\"\n       Option          \"SHMConfig\"             \"On\"\n       Option          \"CircularScrolling\"     \"0\"\n       Option          \"PalmDetect\"    \"1\"\n       Option          \"PalmMinWidth\"  \"10\"\n       Option          \"PalmMinZ\"      \"20\"\n#       Option          \"ZAxisMapping\"          \"4 5\n#       Option          \"Buttons\"               \"11\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
