For the others the predictor is \nlog(median).\n\nThis causes problems when comparing predictions and a better way IMHO is to \ncorrect the Weibull prediction by a factor (log(2))^(1/scale).  This is only \na simple multiple unless the shape parameter is also being modelled, when a \ncompletely different solution may arise.  Such heterogeneity modelling cannot \nof course be done within survreg().\n\nOn Monday 18 June 2007 22:56:54 Frank E Harrell Jr wrote:\n> sj wrote:\n> > I am using psm to model some parametric survival data, the data is for\n> > length of stay in an emergency department.
