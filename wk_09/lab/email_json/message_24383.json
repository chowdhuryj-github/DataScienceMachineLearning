You have to have admin credentials\nto do this anyways so we should trust you.  But I'm not\nparticularly tied to the current patch.    Just seems a\nlittle redundant to me.  If others think a --force flag\nis necessary, I'll go along with it.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGPoJWIR7qMdg1EfYRAtV2AJoCaODT6na7Q8BMMJUPBL/VZm6BsgCfXBpZ\necQos/cmxS+h6ONTP5qTxTA=\n=/Cn5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
