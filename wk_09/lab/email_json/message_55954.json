The right side isn't an \"empty value\", it's a scalar\nvalue called undef. As it is in a list context, that becomes a\none-element list. But hashes need lists of key-value pairs. You meant\nthis:\n\n  my(%hash) = ();\n\nBut that's really the same as this:\n\n  my %hash;\n\n>        my %hash = ( $product => $qty);\n\nAnd here, you have declared a new variable named %hash. But what I\nthink you wanted was to assign to an element in the hash:\n\n   $hash{$product} = $qty;  # add element to hash\n\nDoes that get you closer to your goal? Good luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Traning\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
