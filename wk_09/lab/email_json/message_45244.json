I've tried to find that information on the\nR mail-group info pages, can't seem to find it. Is it something\nobvious?\n\nTo begin a brand new discussion, you do your post as an e-mail sent to\n r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch .\nAs I am doing right now.\n\nHow do I do an additional post that gets included in the\n\"[R] Tools For Preparing Data For Analysis\" thread, a thread which I\nstarted myself yesterday ( thanks for all the responses everybody )?\n\nThere's got to be a real easy answer to that, since everybody else does that.\n(I'm using gmail, does it make a difference what e-mail host you use?).\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nPS\nIf you happen to be reading this, Christophe Pallier & Martin Stevens,\nI will respond to your request for examples shortly, once I figure\nthis posting how-to out. My examples will come from data preparation\nproblems in clinical trial data ( I worked for 8 years on clinical\ntrial analysis before beginning work on Vilno ). I'll probably use lab\ndata as an example because  lab data can be messy and difficult to\nwork with.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
