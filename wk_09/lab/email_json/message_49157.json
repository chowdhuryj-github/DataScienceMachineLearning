Do you really want random people running\nrandom code on your box?  Quite a few firewall administrators agree\nwith me about this, because they don't allow it.\nUnfortunately, we have to live with it.\n\nPDF has one use-case IMHO: the creation of printable documents.  I use\nit quite often for this purpose.  However, storing documents in PDF is\na step backward, rather than a step forward.  Why?  PDF is *not* a\nmachine-readable format.  HTML, ASCII, RTF, and even Microsoft Word\nare machine-readable.  This does not hold for PDF and PostScript.\nUnfortunately, many people seem to use PDF for document storage, even\nthough it is not suited to this task.\n\nAs for Flash, I cannot say much about it.  From what I know, its\npurpose is the transmission of animated movies.  I doubt those are\nterribly accessible.  Regardless, sending me movies that I cannot see\nis a waste of my bandwidth.  Finally, Flash is a proprietary format.\nWhy should I care about it?\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
