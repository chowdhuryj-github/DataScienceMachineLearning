It seems to me that the least\nsurprising behavior would be for the POD comment to be swallowed up by\nthe block comment, on the basis that a block comment ought to be\nequivalent to prefixing every line from its start to end with a C<# >.\n Conversely, I'd expect a block comment that's nested inside a POD\ncomment to be passed to the POD parser as ordinary POD text.  In\nshort, whichever kind of comment comes first should dominate.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
