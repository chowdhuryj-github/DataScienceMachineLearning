You might want to extend the function \nby allowing xlab / ylab and other arguments. Additionally, you might \nwant to remove a couple of hard coded values in order to make the \nfunction more generally usable. I am pretty sure the authors/maintainer \n(CCing the maintainer) of pamr will be happy about your contributions, \nif you submit well designed improvements.\n\nBest regards,\nUwe Ligges\n\n\n\n> Thanks\n> \n> \n> \n> \n>       Looking for people who are YOUR TYPE?
