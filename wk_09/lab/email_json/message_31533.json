Here's the fix:\n\nnext unless /#define\\s+(\\w+)\\s+\\(([^)]+)\\)\\s+\\/\\*\\s+\\@LOG\\s+(\\w+)\\s+\\*\\//;\n\nAnd here is a possible alternative. I'm not sure what your other lines \nto match look like, so your mileage may vary.\n\nmy ($name, $base, $offset, $struct) =\n    $line =~ m!#define\\s+(\\w+)\\s+\\((\\w+).*?(\\w+)\\).*?\\s+(\\w+)!;\n\nHope this helps,\n-m\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
