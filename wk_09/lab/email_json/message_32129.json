Wasn't that the whole idea of +xml?\n\nWell, yes, but the language lawyers argue as follows:\n\nExcept for UTF-8 and UTF-16, there is absolutely no guarantee\nthat an XML parser accepts any encoding whatsoever. There is\na lot of XML out there with e.g.\n   \nbut no XML parser is required to grok that (although many do).\nSo you can view binary XML just as an extremely weird and special\ncharacter encoding. I personally wish it wouldn't be necessary,\nbut there are people who claim that it is, for whatever it's worth.\n\nThe successor of RFC 3032 shouldn't mention binary XML explicitly\n(except by example), but just say that the boundary between what's\nokay and what's not okay for a +xml prefix is whether the document\nstarts as an XML document as described in appendix F of the XML\nRec, and can correctly be parsed after the conversion from that\n'character' encoding to XML.\n\nWhat I also would like to see (in particular in my role as\none of the IETF charset reviewers) is how to make sure that\nthe labels for binary encodings won't in the future collide\nwith real registered charsets. Probably the best way to do\nthis would be to create some kind of 'provisional' registration,\nor 'reserving' registration in the charset registry.\nBut that would need some work on a spec, at the moment,\nprobably the best way to do things would be to try and\nget some kind of comment into the charset registry.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n#-#-#  Martin J.
