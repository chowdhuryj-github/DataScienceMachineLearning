It's _never_ ok.\n\nImagine that Samba is installed in /net/some_nfs/drive/samba and nfs\nis down. What happens then? smbstatus then goes to '.' and the\nsecurity hole is back.\n\nPlease just revert the patch. There is no way we should ever be\nlooking in '.' for scripts or libraries of any kind.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
