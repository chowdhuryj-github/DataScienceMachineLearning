It is also good practice to say what platform you \nare on (OS, R version, etc.) as reported by sessionInfo().\n\n> Thank you very much by advance\n> \n>\n>\n\n-- \nRoger Bivand\nEconomic Geography Section, Department of Economics, Norwegian School of\nEconomics and Business Administration, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen,\nNorway. voice: +47 55 95 93 55; fax +47 55 95 95 43\ne-mail: Roger.Bivand@nhh.no\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
