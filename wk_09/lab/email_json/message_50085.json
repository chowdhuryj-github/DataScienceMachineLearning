How can I obtain the statistics and p-value associated with\ndiscriminant analysis? Am I supposed to calculate that manually by squaring\nthe svd value and looking the p value up in a table? I am writing the\nfollowing code:\n\ntraining.mx<-read.table('C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\silvia\\\\My\nDocuments\\\\silvia\\\\paper Martin\\\\trainingAndvalidation.txt', header=T)\ntrain <- sample (1:148) ##in a file with 399 cases, I am using the first 148\nas a training set\ntable(training.mx$disperser[train])\ntraining.df <- lda (disperser~., training.mx, subset=train)\npredict (training.df, training.mx[-train,])$class\n\n2nd. How can I get the scores for each species on the discriminant\nfunctions? I only get the scores for the group means, but I need the values\nfor all species.\n\n3rd. Is it possible to obtain confidence intervals for my groups?\n\n4th. (this is part of a previous posting but it's related to all my previous\nquestions so here it goes again) When I try to plot the resulting\ndiscriminant functions following the example I found in the help, I get an\nerror saying that 'panel.lda' doesn't exist. Am I supposed to create it?\nHere is the code for the plot:\n\nplot(x, panel = panel.lda, cex = 0.7, dimen=1,\n     xlab = \"LD1\", ylab = \"LD2\")\n\nHelp on any or all of these questions will be greatly appreciated!\n\nSilvia.\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/discriminant-analysis-with-lda%28MASS%29-tf3941130.html#a11178433\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
