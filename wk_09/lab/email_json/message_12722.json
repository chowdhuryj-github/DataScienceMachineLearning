And, I have to admit that I agree. \n\nBut then, an open-source listserv is, in essence, a help desk....well, maybe\nnot a desk, but we do help each other. My conflicting feelings about this\nare better left for a therapist but, in the meanwhile, perhaps we need a\nrevision of Ayn Rand's \"Virtue of Selfishness\" and how it may or may not\nextend to the open-source community.\n\nAll in fun,\n\nJeff\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Stephen Tucker\nSent: Sunday, April 22, 2007 2:39 PM\nTo: Nima Tehrani; R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] queries\n\nhist(rnorm(100),xlab=\"Data\",ylab=\"Count\",main=\"\")\ntitle(main=\"Histogram of ...\",cex=0.5)\n\nsee ?par for details on xlab, ylab, main, and cex arguments.\nYou can call these from title() or include them in hist().\nI called title(main=..) separately to control its size separately\nfrom the rest of the text (axis and tick labels).\n\n\n\n--- Nima Tehrani  wrote:\n\n> Dear Help Desk,\n>    \n>   Is there any way to change some of the labels on R diagrams? \n>    \n>   Specifically in histograms, I would like to: \n>    \n>   1.             change the word frequency to count. \n>   2.
