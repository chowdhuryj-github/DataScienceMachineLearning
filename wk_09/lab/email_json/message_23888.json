The very best and the very worst.\n\nEverybody in the world thought we couldn't do it. But we did, dammit. [After winning the America's Cup]\n\nNothing is less in our power than the heart, and far from commanding we are forced to obey it.\n\nThe Church is not a gallery for the exhibition of eminent Christians, but a school for the education of imperfect ones.\n\nIn private life I never knew anyone interfere with other people's disputes but he heartily repented of it.\n\nFaith is the vision of the heart it sees God in the dark as well as in the day.\n\nI have learned not to worry about love but to honor its coming with all my heart.\n\nPost-modernism is modernism with the optimism taken out.\n\nThe difference between life and the movies is that a script has to make sense, and life doesn't.\n\nExample is not the main thing in influencing others. It is the only thing.\n\nThe best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry.\n\nCommon sense is genius in homespun.\n\n\n"}
