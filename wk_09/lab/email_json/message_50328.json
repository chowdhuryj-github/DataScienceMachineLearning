All of those methods worked, though I did have to first convert my matrices using the data.matrix command. Thank you for the assistance.\n\nIs there any equally simple way to re-convert the resulting table/matrix to its original NxN form? I do not see any obvious opposites to the cbind or as.table commands.\n\nAlso, Jeff Laake, is there a way to have your routine output the vectors as numeric values (i.e., without the surrounding quote marks)?\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nJeff Laake  wrote:  > x=matrix(1:9,nrow=3)\n > colnames(x)=c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")\n > row.names(x)=c(\"1\",\"2\",\"3\")\n > x\n  a b c\n1 1 4 7\n2 2 5 8\n3 3 6 9\n > \ncbind(as.vector(x),colnames(x)[as.vector(col(x))],row.names(x)[as.vector(row(x))])\n      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n [1,] \"1\"  \"a\"  \"1\"\n [2,] \"2\"  \"a\"  \"2\"\n [3,] \"3\"  \"a\"  \"3\"\n [4,] \"4\"  \"b\"  \"1\"\n [5,] \"5\"  \"b\"  \"2\"\n [6,] \"6\"  \"b\"  \"3\"\n [7,] \"7\"  \"c\"  \"1\"\n [8,] \"8\"  \"c\"  \"2\"\n [9,] \"9\"  \"c\"  \"3\"\n >\n\n\nphilozine wrote:\n> Hi R-listers,\n>\n> I'm using R only for a few basic functions but am having difficulty doing something that *should* be simple. I have an nxn matrix, Q, where Q[i,j] is a directed value (in this case, oil exports from i to j). Note that Q[i,j]~=Q[j,i]. I imported column names along with the matrix then copied them to the rows using rownames(Q) <- colnames(Q). Simple so far.\n>\n> What I'd like to do now is convert Q for export into a vector of values with the original row and column names intact. Having one vector each for row, column, and cell would be ideal, e.g., [1,1] = i's name, [1,2] = j's name, and [1,3] = Q[i, j]. But just being able to export my matrix data in vector form with the correct row/col names for each observation would be sufficient.\n>\n> Thus far I've tried c(), vector(), and a few others, but can't get the correct results. They do generate the correct vector of matrix values, but they do not appear to retain both row and column names. (Or, rather, I have not discovered how to make them do so.)\n>\n> To illustrate, my data currently look something like this:\n>\n>     A    B    C    D\n> A | 0  |.1 |.4  |.6  |\n> B |.2 | 0  |.2  |.1  |\n> C |.5  |.9  | 0  |.9  |\n> D |.7  | 0  |.3  | 0  |\n>\n> I would like them to look like this (at least when exported as a .txt file, if not necessary when displayed within R):\n>\n>   i   j   Q\n> | A | A | 0 |\n> | A | B |.1 |\n> | A | C |.4 |\n> | A | D |.6 |\n> | B | A |.2 |\n> | B | B | 0 |\n> | B | C |.2 |\n> [...] and so on\n>\n> If anybody knows how to do this, I will be extremely appreciative!\n>\n> Best regards,\n>\n>\n>        \n> ---------------------------------\n>\n>  [[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>   \n\n\n \n---------------------------------\nThe fish are biting.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
