Here's another example:\n\nlibrary(lattice)\nz <- expand.grid(x = 1:10, p = 1:5, r = 1:10)\nz$y <- rnorm(nrow(z))\nz$p <- factor(z$p, levels = c(1, 5, 2, 4, 3))\nbot <- xyplot(y ~ x | p, z, groups = r,\n               layout = c(2, 2), type = \"l\",\n               scales = list(alternating = 1),\n               subset = p != 3)\ntop <- xyplot(y ~ x | p, z, groups = r,\n               type = \"l\", xlab = \"\",\n               scales = list(alternating = 2),\n               subset = p == 3)\n\nprint(bot, c(0, 0, 1, 11/16))\nprint(top, c(1/5, 7/12, 4/5, 1), newpage = FALSE)\n\n--sundar\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
