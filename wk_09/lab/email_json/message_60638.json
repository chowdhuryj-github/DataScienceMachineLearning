How small is 'smaller' and how\nmany is \"a few\"?\n\nEveryone who has responded to this seems to accept the idea that PCA is\nthe way to go here, but that is not clear to me at all.  There is a\n2-sample structure in the 20 observations that you have.  If you simply\nignore that in doing your PCA you are making strong assumptions about\nsampling that would seem to me unlikely to be met.  If you allow for the\nstructure and project orthogonal to it then you are probably throwing\nthe baby out with the bathwater - you want to choose variables which\nmaximise separation between the 2 samples (and now you are up to 482\nzero principal variances, if that matters...).\n\nI think this problem probably needs a bit of a re-think.  Some variant\non singular LDA, for example, may be a more useful way to think about\nit.\n\nBill Venables.  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Ravi Varadhan\nSent: Monday, 2 July 2007 1:29 PM\nTo: 'Patrick Connolly'\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch; 'Mark Difford'\nSubject: Re: [R] Question about PCA with prcomp\n\nThe PCs that are associated with the smaller eigenvalues. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n-------\n\nRavi Varadhan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, The Center on Aging and Health\n\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology \n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nPh: (410) 502-2619\n\nFax: (410) 614-9625\n\nEmail: rvaradhan@jhmi.edu\n\nWebpage:\nhttp://www.jhsph.edu/agingandhealth/People/Faculty/Varadhan.html\n\n \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n--------\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Patrick Connolly [mailto:p_connolly@ihug.co.nz]\nSent: Monday, July 02, 2007 4:23 PM\nTo: Ravi Varadhan\nCc: 'Mark Difford'; r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Question about PCA with prcomp\n\nOn Mon, 02-Jul-2007 at 03:16PM -0400, Ravi Varadhan wrote:\n\n|> Mark,\n|> \n|> What you are referring to deals with the selection of covariates, \n|> since\nPC\n|> doesn't do dimensionality reduction in the sense of covariate\nselection.\n|> But what Mark is asking for is to identify how much each data point \n|> contributes to individual PCs.
