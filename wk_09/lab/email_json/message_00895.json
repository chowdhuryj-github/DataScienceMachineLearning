Using regression on zero/one dummy variables\ncan work, but there are more direct approaches to classification that\nmight work better.\n\nIn the case that you showed us, the data were linearly separable by one\npredictor. If the data that you posted are representative of your\ntypical data sets, you might want to use a very simple approach:\nidentify the important predictor and use an ROC curve to find a good\ncutoff for it. You don't need the other data.\n\nHowever, if these data represent an \"easy\" case, you might want to try\nother approaches to classification. I usually start with either\nrandomForest or a bagged tree (see the randomForest and ipred packages).\nIf I can get good performance with those models, I'll try simpler models\nthat are more interpretable, like single trees (the rpart package), FDA\nwith method = mars (using the mda package) and other approaches. \n\nMax\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ?? ??

Your sample code is very helpful.\n\nIn linear separable problem, I should use fda by linear regression\ninstead of bruto unless taking some dimensional reduction process,  \nshould I?\n\nCheers.\n\nShuji\n\n\nOn 2007/04/09, at 22:25, Kuhn, Max wrote:\n\n> Shuji,\n>\n> I suspect that bruto blows up because your data are linearly  \n> separable.\n> To see this (if you didn't already know), try\n>\n>    library(lattice)\n>    splom(~x, groups = y)\n>\n> and look at the first row.
