The Atlantic Ocean is saltier than the \n      Pacific Ocean. \n\nTONIGHT ON THE \n      CBS EVENING NEWS Here's an early \n      look at what we are working on for tonight's broadcast of the CBS EVENING \n      NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor Katie Couric... Hi \n      everyone, I\u2019ll be anchoring tonight\u2019s broadcast from North \n      Carolina, home of Duke University, where the sensational case of three \n      lacrosse players accused of sexual assault has unfolded. Now comes \n      redemption for the accused former college students, Reade Seligmann, David \n      Evans and Collin Finnerty. Prosecutors have decided to drop all criminal \n      charges against the young men, saying the athletes were victims of a \n      \u201ctragic rush to accuse\u201d by District Attorney Mike Nifong \u2013 who himself is \n      now under scrutiny. I\u2019ll have that story and my colleagues will be \n      with me in North Carolina covering all the angles. The rape \n      accusation last spring has had widespread ramifications --- it has stoked \n      racial tensions in the Raleigh-Durham community, scarred three families \n      and tarnished the reputation of one of the country\u2019s top universities --- \n      but, as Bob Orr will report, the legal case really was no case at \n      all. Despite that, the parents of the three accused men, who are \n      now 20, 21 and 24 years old, spent an estimated $3.5 million on lawyers. \n      All three are now vindicated, but are still victims. Byron Pitts \n      will take a look at how the accusation has changed the lives of the \n      accused young men and will tell us where they are now. Another \n      reputation tarnished by the accusations was that of one of the country\u2019s \n      top higher education institutions: Duke University. Kelly Wallace \n      will take a look at the media glare that focused on Duke and its lacrosse \n      team for the past year and assess the impact of the accusation on the \n      campus and community. And then we\u2019ll turn to the controversy over \n      on-air comments made by Don Imus about the Rutgers women\u2019s basketball \n      team. The radio host was suspended for two weeks after making the remarks, \n      but it is yet to be seen whether he will stay in his position. But how \n      much is he worth to his broadcasters and advertisers? Anthony Mason \n      will have the story. Finally, I sat down with the family of \n      Reid Seligmann, one of the accused Duke lacrosse players. I\u2019ll \n      share our conversation with you tonight. I hope you\u2019ll join \n      us.

Arcoxia, a pain-relieving drug in the same \n      class of the more familiar Vioxx and Bextra, could be approved for use in \n      patients with arthritis. If approved, Arcoxia would be the first in the \n      same class of drugs as Vioxx and Bextra to gain United States approval \n      since those drugs were pulled from the market after showing links to heart \n      attack and stroke in 2004 and 2005. The agency is not required to follow \n      the panel's recommendation, though it often does. We\u2019ll have details \n      Thursday morning.

We had so many amazing adventures on the road \n      over the past two months that it was impossible to show you everything \n      that happened along the way. So we decided to take a look at some of the \n      funnier moments of our All Access trips that you may not have seen \n      yet. We\u2019ll have all the highlights\u2026 and the lowlights, Thursday morning! \n      YOUNG AT HEART: BOOMERS AND BUSINESS: While boomers are \n      reaching what some say is the better part of their lives. So how common is \n      it for boomers to start their own businesses? The answer may surprise you. \n      More and more, boomers are becoming successful entrepreneurs. Thursday \n      morning, we\u2019ll have some tips on how an eye for possibility and a take \n      charge attitude can achieve business gold. Nancy Perry Graham, Deputy \n      Editor AARP The Magazine, will join us with her advice. \n      ROSE MCGOWAN ON GRINDHOUSE: Actress Rose McGowan \n      made a name for herself in dark teen comedies such as Scream and \n      Jawbreaker. She then starred in the bewitching Charmed for \n      five years, playing Paige Matthews on the show about three sisters \n      battling the forces of evil. Now, McGowan stars in Grindhouse, a \n      double-bill of thrillers that pays homage to its dual filmmakers' favorite \n      exploitation films. In Quentin Tarantino\u2019s slasher film, Death \n      Proof, the killer pursues his targets with a vehicle rather than with \n      a knife. Robert Rodriguez contributes Planet Terror, in which he \n      explores an alien world similar to ours. The combination of the two films \n      results in an action-packed film unlike anything you have seen before. \n      McGowan plays Pam in Death Proof and Cherry in Planet \n      Terror. She will join us Thursday morning to talk about her experience \n      during the project and her love of the finished product. \n      WILLIAMS SONOMA CREPES: Many people love a certain French \n      dish but find it intimidating to make at home. It is the crepe. Americans \n      think of the crepe as a \"thin\" pancake. . . but as it turns out, it is an \n      incredibly versatile foundation for both sweet and savory flavors. So how \n      can you wow your breakfast guests with a crepe that is surprisingly easy \n      to prepare? Cookbook author Tori Ritchie will join us to demystify this \n      delicious treat so that we can easily enjoy it at home.
