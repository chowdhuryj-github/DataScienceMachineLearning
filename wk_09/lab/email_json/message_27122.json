Market breadth is terrific, interest rates are low and\nsentiment is not exuberant.  It's a great time to make money, and I will\ndiscuss some favorite stocks later on.\n\nBut first I want to step back and take a look at where we are today in the\nU.S. from a very long-term perspective.  And therein lies the bad news.\n\nThis story of the U.S. begins . . . in most accounts . . . with the\narrival of the Mayflower in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620.  You could\nargue that I should begin with the arrival of the Jamestown, Virginia\nsettlers in 1607 or Christopher Columbus in 1492 or Leif Ericson in 1000\nor even the Native Americans who emigrated from Asia long before.\n\nBut I'm telling the story so that's where I'll start . . . in part because\nI recently read the book \"Mayflower\" by Nathaniel Philbrick . . . and then\nheard the man speak at a lecture.   \n\"Mayflower\" is an exhaustively researched book, focusing not just on that\nwell-publicized landing, or the first winter, when half the colonists\ndied, but on the numerous difficulties encountered in the subsequent 55\nyears.  The book features hardship and courage in abundance.  But there's\nalso selfishness, deceit and plain old double-crossing.\n\nAnd the Native Americans were everywhere, often cooperating with the\ncolonists in exchange for material goods, but sometimes resisting when\ntheir demands grew onerous.  As the decades passed, and the white man's\nappetite for land grew, tensions increased.  Finally, in 1675, King\nPhilip, son of Massasoit (who had befriended the Pilgrims in 1621), fought\nback, and the result was King Philip's War, which in the course of a year\nbrought the deaths of some 600 colonists and 3,000 Native Americans.\n\nIt was another century until the United States was formed and broke free\nfrom England, and another century and three-quarters until the U.S. become\nthe world's largest economy.\n\nThe reasons for that achievement are well know.  Abundant natural\nresources, freedom, immigration of motivated people, capitalism, and an\nattitude that recognized the growth potential inherent in those assets. \nToday, the U.S. is still the #1 economy in the world, some three times\nlarger than #2 Japan.  But the gap is shrinking, in part because the\nnatural resources are running out (we can no longer just push on\nwestward).\n\nBut the picture is far more complex than that, and this brings me to Kevin\nPhillips, the erstwhile Republican strategist who has written several\nbooks and who spoke in Salem this past weekend to promote his latest book,\npublished last year, \"American Theocracy.\"\n\nAt first glance, it's a book that critiques President Bush and his\ncohorts, and that by itself is unremarkable; there are plenty of those. \nBut this one is of interest because it comes from a man who formerly\nworked in the upper levels of the Republican Party.  And when I learn that\nan intelligent man - after rational consideration - has switched his\nallegiance, I pay attention.  It's a rare man or woman who is open-minded\nenough to do that!\n\nBut I don't want to get into Bush today.  I want to focus on the theme\nthat Mr. Phillips highlights in the new, updated introduction to his book,\na theme he spent considerable time on during his speech.\n\nThe theme: the U.S. is nearing the end of its position as the leading\neconomic force in the world, and the decades ahead will be increasingly\ndifficult because of this loss of power.\n\nNow, this is a theme I've considered before; even a cursory knowledge of\nhistory as taught in school reveals that all previous world powers have\neventually ceded the leadership baton to someone else, and suggests that\nthe U.S. is likely to follow the same path.\n\nMr. Phillips, however, described specific characteristics of our current\nposition in the U.S. and discussed how these are similar to conditions that\nexisted when previous world powers were at their peaks.\n\nThe old leaders are Rome, Spain, Holland and England, and the\ncharacteristics that marked their peaks are in some ways varied, but in\nmany ways the same.  So here they are.\n\n1. A popular sense of national decay, economic, moral or patriotic.   \n(Why have there been calls to impeach our last two presidents?)\n\n2.  An intensification of religion.  (If we truly have separation of\nchurch and state, why has no member of Congress had the courage to admit\nthat he or she is an atheist?)\n\n3.  Conflict between faith and science.  (Teaching creationism in schools\nas an alternative to evolution?)\n\n4.  Imperialism and military overreach  (Iraq?)\n\n5.  The burden of excessive debt.  (Why is our national debt $8.8\ntrillion?)\n\n6.  The decline of industry and the rise of finance.  (Are hedge funds\nreally better for us than GE and GM?)\n\nSo there you have it.  Of course, the future is not written in stone. \nAnything is possible.  (These are the same words I use in discussing the\nfuture of individual stocks; it's all probability.)   \nBut I do respect Mr. Phillips' reasoning.  I'm of the school that says,\n\"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.\"  It happens with individual\nstocks and I see no reason why it shouldn't happen with individual\ncountries, as well.\n\nIn fact, there's a passage in our \"Momentum System 1000,\" which is\ndistributed to all readers of the Cabot Market Letter, which reads, \"All\nliving things have life cycles.  They grow, mature and then finally die. \nWe see this all around us in many different forms: in flowers, animals,\ntrees and people.  But we also see it in organizations.  Organizations are\nborn, they grow and mature.  They develop strengths and weaknesses for a\nvariety of reasons.  Some, like political organizations, metamorphose\nslowly from year to year.   \nEven countries go through life cycles ....  But any organization, even a\ncountry, can die if it's not managed properly!\"\n\nThose words were first written in 1975, and there's no way my father was\nthinking of the U.S. when he wrote them.  And I'm certainly not saying the\nU.S. will die.  But when you weigh the growing economic might of China and\nIndia and the slowing growth of the U.S., it's not hard to conclude that\nwe will likely slip to #2 at some point in the decades ahead.\n\nKnowing this possibility, what do you do?\n\nPerhaps nothing.  After all, whether Mr. Phillips is right or not, the sun\nwill continue to rise every day, your children (or parents) will still\nneed your attention, and working on things you have control over can be\nmore rewarding than worrying about things over which you have little\ncontrol.\n\nBut maybe you look a little more closely at investments outside the U.S.,\nparticularly in the fast-growing BRIC countries.  (That's Brazil, Russia,\nIndia and China.)\n\nIn any event, it's food for thought.\n\nIf you've got an intelligent comment on the subject, feel free to visit\nthe Cabot Discussion Forum to share it with others.  Just click the link\nbelow.\n\nhttp://www.cabotwealth.com/forums\n\n==\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?\n\nPaul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks for\npromising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of\nthe BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). They must also meet\nstrict criteria regarding fundamentals and technicals. These\nrecommendations will have healthy balance sheets and will show solid\ngrowth.\n\nVisit the link below to see the explosive profits from the fast-growing\nopportunities Paul recommends. See how $5,000 can soar to $10,000,\n$15,000, $25,000-or more-over the next two to three years.\n\nRated #1 Top Performing Newsletter for 2006 by The Hulbert Financial\nDigest:\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/177553/13148861/84/0/\n\n==\n\nAnd now back to the market, which is strong as a bull, healthy as a horse\nand climbing like a homesick angel into new-high territory day after day. \nThe advance-decline line is strong, there are no divergences, and\nsentiment is still not euphoric!  Bottom line: I expect the market to\ncontinue this incredible ascent.\n\nAnd if you're not fully invested yet?\n\nWell, you know I love solar power stocks.  They had a brief pullback early\nlast week, but the selling volume wasn't convincing.   \nFurthermore, several of the stocks I've been watching stopped their\ndecline right at the 50-day moving average, giving a classic technical\nshort-term buy signal.  So I added one more solar stock to the portfolio\nof the Cabot Market Letter.\n\nBut I don't want to talk about that today.  I want to talk about a new\nname, one that may suit your portfolio if you're looking to diversify\noutside the U.S.   The industry is transportation.  We all know that GM\nand Ford are sick because of high labor and health care costs.  And we all\nknow that the Chinese are fast trading in their bicycles for automobiles.  But\nit's hard to find a direct investment there, because Chinese automakers\nChery and Geely don't trade on major U.S. exchanges yet.\n\nBut China Yuchai Diesel (CYD) does.  It trades on the New York Exchange,\nand it was recommended by Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging\nMarkets Report, in last week's issue.  Here's some of what he wrote.\"\n\n\"China Yuchai (CYD) is one of the top three manufacturers of light-,\nmedium- and heavy-duty diesel engines in China . . . With an R&D budget of\nmore than $3 million a year, plus an in-house R&D staff of more than 100,\nthe company is working hard to improve the efficiency and environmental\nfriendliness of its engines.  This is important for two reasons.  First,\nthe Eurozone markets have strict requirements for all diesel engines, both\nimported and domestic, and many of China Yuchai's engines are already\napproved for sale there.  And second, as China's own environmental\nconditions become more of an issue, China Yuchai wants to be well\npositioned to meet any additional emissions requirements that the\ngovernment imposes.\"\n\nSo technology is on the company's side as it works to supply the diesel\nengines needed both in and out of China.  But this is not a pure growth\nstory, as are most of Paul's Chinese stocks; this is actually a turnaround\nstory!\n\nPaul wrote, \"CYD, which had traded in the low single digits for years,\ncaught a wave in 2002, rising from 1 at the beginning of the year to 30\nnear the end of 2003.  But after that, the stock (and the company's\nprofits) started a downtrend that didn't end until the stock bottomed out\n3 1/2 years later back at 4.5.  Since that low in July 2006, CYD has\nworked its way back.\"\n\nWhat I like about it is that it still looks like a good value!  China\nYuchai saw revenues of $871 million last year, but the stock's market\ncapitalization is just $376 million.  In the fourth quarter of last year,\nrevenues grew at a 56% rate, and that's probably unsustainable.  But a 20%\nrate looks easily attainable.  And profit margins of 3% to 5% shouldn't be\nhard to achieve either.\n\nOf course, there are risks.  One is the Chinese government, which can\nchange the rules of the game at any time.  Two is the stock's relatively\nlow liquidity; average daily trading volume is 200,000 shares.  And three\nis the stock's low price.  Generally, the lower the price, the higher the\nrisk.  (That low price also means quicker rewards are possible.)\n\nWhen Paul recommended this stock last week it was trading at 9.   \nToday it's at 10.  Part of that advance may be due to Paul's\nrecommendation; it's hard to tell.  My suggestion: if you're interested,\nwait to buy until the stock's next small correction is over.\n\n==\n\nEditor's Note\n\nYou can get regular updates on China Yuchai Diesel in every issue of Cabot\nChina & Emerging Markets Report.
