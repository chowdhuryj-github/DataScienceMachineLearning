Sharyl Attkisson will report from Washington, D.C., on\n  the battle over Iraq.\n  \n\n  We\u2019ll also show you some of the results of a new CBS News/New York Times poll, which includes\n  Americans\u2019 opinions about the troop withdrawal bill as well as the\n  environment.

Nancy\n  Cordes will tell you what other foodstuffs enter the United States from China, and Barry Peterson will report on how those\n  products are inspected.

Our own Julie Chen recently visited the set to\n  ask the CSI cast about both.\n  She went behind the scenes to get a taste of the action first hand. And she\n  learned that the cast is not the only group with challenging roles. It was a\n  challenge for the creative wizards at CSI\n  to make a believable model of character Lorenzo \"Happy\" Morales, a\n  boxer who takes an arrow through the neck and gets shot with a hypodermic\n  filled with snake venom. We'll go behind the scenes Friday morning. \n\nHIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL IN HARLEM: A JON\n  FRANKEL DOCUMENTARY: High school football has long been a part of Americana: the\n  rivalries, families gathering under the lights, cheerleaders flipping on the\n  field.

He was a\n  down-to-earth racing icon, a tough businessman, an innovator and he was\n  married to the love of his life, Trudy. It all came to a horrible end almost\n  twenty years ago when Mickey and Trudy were gunned down, execution style, in\n  the driveway of their Los Angeles\n  area home. I remember covering this story as a young news reporter, and it's\n  fitting for me to be present at the final chapter. \n\n  From the beginning, the focus of the investigation was Mickey Thompson's\n  colorful business partner, Mike Goodwin. But there was no physical evidence\n  to tie him to the crimes. For the past two decades, through a series of\n  fascinating twists and turns, detectives and Thompson's hard-driving sister\n  Colleen have been pursuing Goodwin, hoping his flamboyant personality and his\n  big mouth would be his undoing. In our program this week, we will take you\n  step by step through this fascinating case... and you'll be able to watch\n  what many considered the surprise ending in court. Murder in the Fast Lane was an amazing story for me to\n  live, and to report. I hope you will join us on Saturday night.\" \n\n  - Bill Lagattuta \n\n(48 Hours Mystery\n  airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT) \n\n  If you would like more information on any of these stories or the broadcast,\n  please click on the following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSUNDAY ON\u00a060 MINUTES\n\u00a0\nAT THE CENTER OF THE STORM: Ex-CIA\n  Director George Tenet appears in his first network television interview to\n  talk about what it was like as the head of the security agency during 9/11,\n  the war on terror and the hunt for Osama bin Laden. He also says that the\n  Bush Administration acted dishonorably when it used his famous \"slam\n  dunk\" remark about WMD in Iraq to ruin his reputation and\n  his career. \n\nARMED AND DANGEROUS: Should\n  someone who has been deemed an imminent danger to himself, like Virginia Tech\n  shooter Seung Hui Cho, be allowed to own a gun? The law says no, but advocates\n  for the mentally ill say yes.
