I'm\nusing Windows XP. After R CMD INSTALL or R CMD check I get an error\nmessage that I don't understand. I've tried to follow the instrucions\nprovided in the R Installation and Administration .pdf and the text\nfile that comes with Rtools, but most of this is new to me and clearly\nI'm missing something. Here's what I've done:\n\n-Downloaded perl and Rtools and put them in my c directory\n-Used package.skeleton() to set up the package structure and put the\npackage-to-be \"removal\" in C:\\toBuild\n-I edited my path to :\nC:\\Rtools\\bin;C:\\perl\\bin;C:\\Rtools\\MinGW\\bin;C:\\R-2.5.0\\bin;...\n-I changed the following in the MkRules file:\n1)HEADER=C:/Rtools/MinGW/include\n2)HELPTYPES = -txt\n3)WINHELP = NO\n4)HEADER=C:/Rtools/MinGW/include\n5)R_EXE=C:/R-2.5.0/bin/R.exe\n-Next, I opened up a command prompt and went to c:/toBuild\n-Then I ran: R CMD build removal. No problems.\n-Then I ran: R CMD INSTALL removal_1.0.tar.gz\nand got this:\n---------------------\ninstalling to 'c:/R-2.5.0/library'\n\nlatex: not found\nlatex: not found\nlatex: not found\n\n---------- Making package removal ------------\nlatex: not found\n  adding build stamp to DESCRIPTION\nlatex: not found\nlatex: not found\nlatex: not found\n  installing R files\nlatex: not found\n  installing data files\nlatex: not found\n  installing man source files\n  installing indices\nlatex: not found\nlatex: not found\n  not zipping data\n  installing help\n >>> Building/Updating help pages for package 'removal'\n     Formats: text chm\n  RemProbs                          text                           chm\n  add.error                         text                           chm\n  error.plot                        text                           chm\n  firstDetect                       text                           chm\n  funs                              text                           chm\n  path                              text                           chm\n  pll2                              text                           chm\n  remll2                            text                           chm\n  removal-package                   text                           chm\n  removal2                          text                           chm\n  var.d                             text                           chm\nhhc: not found\ncp: cannot stat `C:/toBuild/R.INSTALL.3064/removal/chm/removal.chm':\nNo such fil\ne or directory\nmake[1]: *** [chm-removal] Error 1\nmake: *** [pkg-removal] Error 2\n*** Installation of removal failed ***\n\nRemoving 'c:/R-2.5.0/library/removal'\n---------------\n\nI don't know what hhc is. I'm guessing its trying to build the\ncompiled help files even though I tried to ask for only text files. It\nalso seems to want latex even though I read that it isn't necessary to\nbuild simple packages. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing\nwrong? Thanks.\n\nRichard\n\n\n-- \nRichard Chandler, PhD student\nDepartment of Natural Resources Conservation\nUMass Amherst\n(413)545-1237\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
