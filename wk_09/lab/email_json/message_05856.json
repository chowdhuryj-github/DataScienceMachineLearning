It was the same one the Peruvian \nleader Jose de San Martin had used when proclaiming independence from \nSpain in 1820.\n    The western South American nation is rich in antiquities from before \nthe Inca empire, which ruled much of the region for hundreds of years up \nto the 16th century, as well as artworks dating from the subsequent \nSpanish colonial times.\n    Peru's soil yields numerous fossils and archaeological finds -- many \nof which are looted by so-called huaqeros, smugglers who swoop onto \nremote sites at night. This carries a five-year jail term, but looters \noften get away with a fine.\n    Authorities say they lack the power and resources to fight back.\n    \"It's difficult to guard more than 10,000 archaeological sites,\" \nsays Blanca Alva, the institute's official in charge of defending \nheritage. Among Peru's private museums, about 300 do not have their \nholdings inventoried, she adds.\n    After looting, the first point of sale is often children hawking \nitems on the street to tourists. These valuables have varied from \nantique fabrics to 6-inch-long teeth from a megalodon, a type of \nprehistoric shark.\n    Orders for objects also come from the Internet, Interpol says. A \nmuseum near Lima removed from its displays a wooden statue of the \nmythological god Pachacamac, fearing it would be stolen after offers to \nbuy it were made online.\n    In remote parts of the Andes Mountains, Miss Alva says, colonial-era \nchurches have been stripped of their finery. In the central Mantaro \nValley, chapels are missing their altarpieces, pictures and other \nreligious treasures.\n    \"Everything has been stolen, including the gold and silver \nchalices,\" Miss Alva says.\n    The stolen goods are trafficked far afield. Interpol is tracking \ncases of items that have wound up in Belgium, France, Spain, Brazil, \nUruguay and the United States.\n    Several years ago, an altar weighing almost half a ton disappeared \nfrom the church of Challapampa in the south-eastern city of Puno and was \nsmuggled across the Bolivian border. It wound up in a Texas art gallery \nbut was returned when Peruvian authorities intervened.\n    A golden headdress dating from at least as far back as the eighth \ncentury and valued at $1 million was recovered in London last year.\n    Also last year, customs agents seized 114 envelopes containing the \nseparated contents of a 397-page 16th-century manuscript stolen from \nPeru's national archives, according to John Alarcon Herrera, head of the \npostal customs authority.\n    Other smugglers' tricks include painting over colonial-era pictures \n-- favorite canvases include works from the so-called Cuzco movement of \nreligious painting.\n    Antique pots, even while being smuggled, are sometimes used as \ncontainers for cocaine.\n\nhttp://washingtontimes.com\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Sun, 15 Apr 2007 12:06:29 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Art thieves hit Chihuly exhibit\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4621F925.8030105@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n\n    Art thieves hit Chihuly exhibit\n\nBY LISA ARTHUR\nCall this one The Case of the Missing Red Reeds.\n\nRed glass reeds, to be precise. Hand-blown sculptures designed by artist \nDale Chihuly swiped on a dark and stormy night -- clich?d but true -- \nfrom Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden.\n\nThe theft happened sometime on the night of April 11, while a nasty \nstorm pounded South Florida. The reeds were discovered missing the next \nmorning, during the daily inventory of the thousands of pieces in the \nChihuly exhibit.\n\nCoral Gables police wouldn't comment Saturday, but Fairchild officials \nsay they are hopeful about cracking the case and recovering the seven to \n12 stolen pieces, each valued in the ``tens of thousands of dollars.''\n\n''We have some DNA evidence and a surveillance tape,'' said Bruce Greer, \npresident of the Fairchild Board of Trustees.\n\nHe declined to elaborate, but did say the heist was definitely not an \ninside job. The tape ruled that out.\n\n''The police asked me not to say anything else until we get the art \nback, and recovery is our focus,'' Greer said.\n\nThis is the second time reed-seeking thieves have hit the popular art \nexhibit. The first incident -- in December, shortly after Chihuly opened \nhis second run at Fairchild -- ended happily with the stolen reeds \nrecovered thanks to an anonymous tipster. There were no arrests; the \ninvestigation remains open.\n\nThe reeds aren't easily portable. The tubelike pieces stand six to seven \nfeet tall, said Nannette Zapata, Fairchild's chief operating officer.\n\n''Who knows what someone would do with them,'' she said. ``Enjoy them. \nSell them. They are valuable pieces of art. They are worth tens of \nthousands of dollars each, at least. This is a major theft.''\n\nGreer said the Chihuly exhibit will continue as scheduled and visitors \nwon't notice that pieces are missing.\n\nChihuly couldn't be reached for comment, but his publicist Janet Makela \nsent the following statement by e-mail: ``We are aware of the incident \nand know that Fairchild has the situation well in hand. They are working \nclosely with local authorities to recover the stolen artwork as quickly \nas possibly.''\n\nThe Seattle artist's six-month installation last winter and spring drew \napproximately 300,000 visitors. His rare return visit to Fairchild ends \nin May.\n\nThe thefts here aren't the first time Chihuly's art has been stolen, \naccording to published reports.\n\nIn 2004, ''Moccasin Brown Desert Basket Set with Turquoise Blue Lip \nWrap,'' valued at $50,000, was stolen from the Mockingbird Art Gallery \nin Bend, Ore. In 2003, a man walked out of an upscale Seattle hotel with \na $40,000 glass bowl that was as big as a 36-inch television set.\n\nIn fact, according to a report in the Seattle Times, at least 25 Chihuly \nworks are listed in the Art Loss Register, an international database \nused by police and art dealers to aid in finding stolen art.\n\nBoth Zapata and Greer said the Fairchild thieves twice beat a \n''sophisticated'' surveillance system that includes cameras and 24-hour \nguards. The thefts hurt the Garden deeply, they said.\n\n''It's quite hurtful to do anything like this to a charity,'' said \nGreer. ``That someone would do this to a place that is a world-class \ninstitution and not want to protect a cultural treasure is something \nthat I don't understand.''\n\nZapata encouraged people who know something about the theft to call the \npolice or Fairchild with tips.\n\n''When stuff like this takes place it doesn't make Miami seem like a \nwonderful place to display art,'' Zapata said. ``It really hurts more \nthan people think.''\n\nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Sun, 15 Apr 2007 12:06:26 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] $26,000 piece of art likely became a puddle\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4621F922.4050405@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\n$26,000 piece of art likely became a puddle\nThe sculpture stolen from an Everett park may have fetched $100 for \nmetal thieves.\n\n/By David Chircop/\n/Herald Writer\n/\n\nEVERETT - A bronze sculpture stolen from an Everett park last September \nwould only bring about $100 if it was melted down and recycled.\n\nBut the theft of the 150-pound art piece wound up costing the city's \ninsurance provider $26,000 to replace.\n\nSultan sculptor Kevin Pettelle believes metal thieves took his \n31/2-foot-tall piece, \"Neck Fragment,\" which was stolen from Evergreen \nArboretum and Gardens in Legion Park.\n\nA city insurance policy paid Pettelle for the loss of the work, which \nthe city had been leasing the statue for $500 a year.\n\n\"It's disheartening and I feel violated, especially if it's going for \nsomething as superficial as drugs,\" said Pettelle, whose work primarily \nfocuses on the human body. \"My guess is that it was taken for the bronze \nand that it's long gone.\"\n\n\"Neck Fragment\" had been on display with permanent art pieces and \nsculptures on loan at the 2.4-acre arboretum since the summer of 2005.\n\nSomebody knocked over the work and sawed the metal sculpture from its base.\n\nWhen he first started sculpting 27 years ago, Pettelle said no one could \nhave predicted that people would one day steal bronze sculptures to melt \ndown for the metal. That was the sort of thing one might expect with \nsculptures made of more precious metals, such as silver.\n\nBut the times have changed.\n\nHis hunch that the bronze was recycled is based on a nationwide rash of \nmetal thefts.\n\nPrices for copper, the main ingredient of bronze, which is an alloy, \nhave skyrocketed recently, a result of demand in China and other quickly \ndeveloping countries. A consequence of that markup has been an increase \nin thefts.\n\nAround the Puget Sound area, metal thieves have been particularly \nbrazen, stealing 2,000 feet of power line that was downed in November's \nsnowstorm. In February, Snohomish County PUD reported that more than \nhalf a mile of wire from streetlights on U.S. 2 near Index was stolen.\n\nIn March, thieves in Federal Way made off with a handmade 23-pound \ncopper gong from Three Trees Yoga & Healing Arts Center, which members \nfeared ended up in a scrap yard.\n\nOther notable metal thefts in the news include brass flag holders, \nripped from the graves of veterans in Pennsylvania and a brass church \nbell lifted from a heritage site in Quebec.\n\nLike pawnbrokers, scrap metal dealers are required to record the \nidentities of their suppliers. Not all operate above board, police say.\n\nAuthorities this week raided a south Seattle scrap yard, which police \nsay was knowingly buying stolen metal items, including copper wire from \nutility companies.\n\nThe theft of the sculpture from Evergreen Arboretum and Gardens in \nLegion Park marks the first time anything was stolen from a public arts \nprogram, in which the city leases sculptures from local artists, Everett \nspokeswoman Kate Reardon said.\n\nThe four-year-old program, run by the city's municipal arts department, \nhas a total of 17 sculptures downtown along Colby Avenue, and a handful \nat the Arboretum.\n\nLater this year, it plans to develop a brochure to promote the downtown \nsculpture walk.\n\nReardon said city park rangers patrol the area where the sculpture was \nstolen, but can't always avoid determined thieves.\n\n\"We rely on the eyes and ears of people out there,\" she said.\n\n/Reporter David Chircop: 425-339-3429 or dchircop@heraldnet.com \n./\n\n*Help sought*\n\nAnyone with information about the sculpture is asked to call the Everett \nPolice Department's tip line at 425-257-8450.\n\n http://heraldnet.com/\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Sun, 15 Apr 2007 12:06:22 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Reward for stolen Goldie's return\nTo: Museum Security Network Mailinglist \nMessage-ID: <4621F91E.6070604@bruggemansolutions.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed\n\nReward for stolen Goldie's return\n\nA reward of up to $20,000 is being offered for information on a rare \nGoldie painting stolen from Auckland University, but few believe the \npainting will be returned.\n\nPlanning Revenge by Charles Goldie was stolen from the university over \nthe Christmas holidays. A set of poems by Colin McCahon and an Oxford \nlectern bible were also taken.\n\nThe Goldie had just been put on display on December 4, leading to \nsuspicions it was stolen to order, said Detective Sergeant Kevin Burke. \n\"There's a definite market for the items that have gone. But they're \nspecialised items in that their appeal is probably limited, as opposed \nto just selling a colour TV or an X-Box down the pub.\"\n\nThe painting's London insurers have hired investigators GAB Robins to \ntrack the treasure - so far without success. The reward is a last \neffort, according to investigators, who say the chances of recovery are \n\"very remote\".\n\n\"I think it went underground very quickly. Because of what it is and how \nwell known it is, [it] is unlikely to surface for a long, long time... \nIt's probably gone to someone's private collection overseas [that we] in \nNew Zealand will not hear about for a long time, at best,\" said an \ninvestigator.\n\n\nBut if information leads to the successful return of the painting, the \nreward could be up to $20,000.\n\n\"It depends on how good the information is - we don't have a specific \nsum,\" said the investigator.\n\nThe other two items are being investigated by Vero Insurance, which is \nnot offering a reward at this stage.\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 91\n***************************************\n\n"}
