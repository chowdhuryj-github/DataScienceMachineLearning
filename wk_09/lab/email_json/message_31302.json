Either or both can be set to FALSE.\n\n2) lars has an additional type = \"stepwise\" option;\n    now the list is type=c(\"lasso\", \"lar\", \"forward.stagewise\",\"stepwise\")\nThis was included because it is trivial to implement, and useful for \ncomparisons.\n\"Stepwise\" is a version of forward stepwise regression, where the \nvariable to\nenter is the one most correlated with the residuals. This is not \nnecessarily the\nsame as the forward stepwise implemented as part of step() in R, where the\nvariable entered is the one that, when included, reduces the RSS the most.\n\n3) a method for summary() has been included, which gives an anova-type \nsummary\nof the sequence of steps.\n\n4) The plot method for lars defaults to plotting coefficients against \nthe relative\nL1 norm of the coefficients. This was not done correctly in general for \ntype \"lar\"\nand \"forward.stagewise\", since the L1 norm does not change smoothly if\ncoefficients pass through zero. This has been fixed.\n\n5) A smalll number of of other changes have been made, some in response \nto email\nmessages from users.\n \nThanks to Yann-Ael Le Borgne for pointing out the problem in (4) and \nproposing\na solution, and to Lukas Meier for reporting some bugs. Please let me \nknow of any\nnew problems, or old ones not yet repaired.\n\nTrevor Hastie\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Trevor Hastie                                  hastie@stanford.edu\n  Professor & Chair, Department of Statistics, Stanford University\n  Phone: (650) 725-2231 (Statistics)\t         Fax: (650) 725-8977\n\t (650) 498-5233 (Biostatistics)\t\t Fax: (650) 725-6951\n  URL: http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie\n  address: room 104, Department of Statistics, Sequoia Hall\n\t          390 Serra Mall, Stanford University, CA 94305-4065\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
