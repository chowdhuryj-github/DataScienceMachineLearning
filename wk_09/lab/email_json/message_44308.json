Or should I try something else? I am on a Windblows machine currently trying to backup personal data and mp3s. Meanwhile I'm trying to make sure I have latest testing dispatcher/speechd-up.\nIf the developers have Speech-Dispatcher/SpeechD-up working perfectly on dual-core boxes over there, I'd like to obtain the very latest tarballs with the most easyest way to install (maybe if both speech-dispatcher/speechd-up have build-sh scripts..or someone could maybe help me create one.\nAnyways, feel free to rsync at:\nKeithNet.DynDNS.org\nUsername (suggested is: keith\nPassword: hinton\n(Only use this information to rsync or scp the tarballs.) All other actions are not permitted and may result in a bann from the system!\nRegards, --Keith\nP.S. I have no way of directly obtaining the CVS stuff.
