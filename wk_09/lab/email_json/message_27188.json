You're probably thinking about how, if you put a\nbackslash in front of a variable, you get a reference to the variable.\n\n> But what purpose does \\ have\n> as a standalone construct? Or is this merely a typo?\n\nThe backslash is a unary operator in Perl, documented in the perlop\nand perlref manpages. It's not the same as the backslash used within\nstring literals, so it's allowed to have optional whitespace between\nit and its operand.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
