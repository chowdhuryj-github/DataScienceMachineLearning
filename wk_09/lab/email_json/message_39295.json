If you mean no\nmonitor, no keyboard, no problem I run it that way on my servers all\nthe time.  If you mean no video card that's another issue because\nspeakup uses video memory to provide review functions.  On the other\nhand if you are running without a video card then you don't need\nspeakup at all so it is a moot point.\n\nWhen I run without a keyboard because I almost never use a monitor you\njust turn off speakup before unplugging and back on when replugging.\n\n  Kirk\n\n-- \n\nKirk Reiser\t\t\t\tThe Computer Braille Facility\ne-mail: kirk@braille.uwo.ca\t\tUniversity of Western Ontario\nphone: (519) 661-3061\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
