A news conference is planned for the afternoon of May 31 with shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale, Launch Director Mike Leinbach and Bill Gerstenmaier, chief of space operations at NASA headquarters. As of this writing, the target launch time is 7:38:00 p.m. on June 8.\n\nThe goal of Atlantis' mission is to attach the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar array segment and rotary joint to the right side of the space station's main power truss, to extend the new arrays and to activate the solar alpha rotary joint, or SARJ, to permit the arrays to track the sun in concert with the P4 arrays on the left side of the truss.\n\nThe astronauts also plan to complete the retraction of two solar array blankets that must be folded before the P6 segment, which provided initial power to the station, can be moved to the left end of the power truss later this year. The crew of the shuttle Discovery ran into major problems retracting one side of the array - P6-4B - in December and procedures have been modified for the still-extended P6-2B blankets.\n\nIn addition, Atlantis will deliver a new space station crew member - Clay Anderson - and bring Sunita Williams back to Earth after six months in space.\n\nA detailed mission preview will be posted early next week. In the meantime, an updated launch windows chart has been posted on the CBS News STS-117 Quick-Look page\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nalong with a revised mission flight plan.
