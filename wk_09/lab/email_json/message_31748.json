The  \ndocumentation I have on it (Lorch & Myers 1990) says to use linear /  \n(subj x linear) to get your F.  However, if I put subject into glm or  \nlm I can't get back a straight error term because it assumes  \n(rightly) that subject is a nominal predictor of some sort.\n\nIn looking at LME it seems like it just does the right thing here if  \nI enter the random effect the same as when looking for ANOVA like  \nresults out of it.  But, part of the reason I'm asking is that I  \nwanted to compare the two methods.  I suppose I could get it out of  \naov but isn't that built on lm?  I guess what I'm asking is how to  \ncalculate the error terms easily with lm.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
