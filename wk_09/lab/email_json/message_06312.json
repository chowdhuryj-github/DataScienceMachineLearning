But without :method, :vtable should \nnot make an entry in the namespace of the class, or call 'add_method' on \nthe class. This results in simpler syntax for the cases where you only \nwant to override the vtable entry.\n\n# method name is the same as vtable name\n.sub get_string :method :vtable\n\n# accessible as either $obj.stringify() or vtable\n.sub stringify :method :vtable('get_string')\n\n# accessible only as vtable\n.sub get_string :vtable\n\n# accessible only as vtable, and sub name ignored\n.sub stringify :vtable('get_string')\n\nAllison\n\n"}
