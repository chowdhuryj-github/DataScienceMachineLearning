Let's hold this patch for the time being.  In the reconfigure/  \nbranch we're working our way through 56 configuration steps and 56  \ncorresponding RT tickets.  Chances are good that we'll develop some  \nadditional subroutines for shortcuts in testing.  We'll see what  \ndevelops as the best way to package these up, then submit a more  \nrefined module to trunk.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
