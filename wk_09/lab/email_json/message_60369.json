Instead, the U.S. will\nonly consult with Korea, and refrain from launching dispute settlement,\nfor any patent linkage noncompliance during this grace period, he said.\n\n\n\nUnder a patent linkage system, the Korean Food and Drug Administration\nwould not grant marketing approval for a drug unless it can certify that\nit does not infringe on a patent.\n\n\n\nKorea had sought this grace period to help its drug companies, which are\nnot sufficiently developed to take on the obligation more quickly\n(Inside U.S. Trade, June 29).\n\n\n\nKorean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong this week also demanded that two\nlabor provisions be changed in the new FTA text that the Bush\nAdministration worked out with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman\nCharles Rangel (D-NY). The USTR spokesman said the U.S. rejected the\nKorean demands for changes to the labor provisions.\n\n\n\nRemarking on Korea*s decision to accept the provisions, Korean Prime\nMinister Han Duck-soo today (June 29) said the new trade policy *is not\ntoo burdensome to Korea,* and that its guidelines *coincide with the\ndirection of our domestic labor and environment policies,* as\ninterpreted by a Korean official.\n\n\n\nThe USTR spokesman said the U.S. made *no commitment* on professional\nvisas, as Korea had sought. *That*s something that the administration\ncan always look at with Congress, but there were no commitments made on\nthat,* he said.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
