For reference, I'm on a duel-core\nAMD system, using gnome-2.16 with an svn orca version (newer revisions\ndon't apper to fix this) and espeak-1.25 with the orca espeak driver.\n\nWhat happens is this. After about 15 minutes or so of leaving gnome/orca\nidle (I still work on text consoles a lot), the keyboard in gnome stops\nresponding. Orca still speaks in gaim, but nothing else works, not even\nalt-f2 and typing 'gnome-terminal.' The only way to regain the keyboard\nis through /etc/init.d/xdm restart.\n\nOne possible reason for this problem might have been the upgrade to\nglibc-2.5-r3 from glibc-2.5-r2 (although if a minor package revision\ncauses this much trouble, that's not good). Is there any way to trace\nthe entirety of my x session, like a strace-type program that will just\ntrace all the interwoven X programs that make up a gnome session?\n.xsession-errors and /var/log/Xorg.0.log tell me nothing.\n\nIf anyone could give me suggestions on how to at least pin down what is\ncausding this issue, I might be able to file a bug report with the\ngentoo folks and see a solution found. If anyone needs (e.g.) my\n/etc/make.conf, email me off-list.\n\nThanks in advance,\nGarrett\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
