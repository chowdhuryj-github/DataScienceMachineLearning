Take, for instance, the (fictive) model below.\n\nlmer(test.result ~ homework + Sex -1 + (1 | School))\n\nSuppose that I suspect the error terms in the predicted values to  \ndiffer between men and women (so, on the first level). In order to  \nmodel this, I want the 'Sex'-variable to be random on the first  \nlevel, as described in Snijders & Bosker, page 110.\n\nDoes anybody know if this is possible and how this can be done using R?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nRense Nieuwenhuis\n\n\nPS. Please excuse me for not providing a self-contained example. I  \ncouldn't find a data-set in the lme4-package that fitted my question.\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
