Mainly because\nwe are simply shifting the responsibility of who is\nsupposed to know what they are doing.  The original\nintent of forcing winbindd to use the winbindd_ads\nmethods if possible was that the the solely rpc\nmethods would not always retrieve the data in a consistent\nmanner.\n\nSo rather than expecting the AD admin to know what they\nare doing, we are shifting the burden on the samba admin\nwhich is not really any better.\n\nPerhaps if someone gave an example of how the AD install\nwas not working it would help to win me over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGWtZGIR7qMdg1EfYRAuFJAJ4/9xS8o1Yw/ZTbRdkBRB0fx0D45QCggJWj\nBKyiS8FkLTHEGYc6Q2XWah0=\n=3r5k\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
