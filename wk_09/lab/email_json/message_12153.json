When installing FC6 or booting up with the GRML CD, I often changed the rate, volume, and two punctuation levels right after I heard \"LiteTalk found.\"  When the system's installed, I put my settings in /etc/rc.local.  I hope this helps, and apologize if I miss what the problem is you're trying to solve.\n\nal\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Nick Gawronski\" \nTo: \nSent: Saturday, April 21, 2007 4:33 PM\nSubject: command line option in speakup to change synthisizer options\n\n\n> Hi, One thing I have found is it is not possible to type for example at\n> the boot prompt of a live CD or in lilo linux speakup_synth=dectlk\n> speakup_rate=0 and other such options even if speakup is built into the\n> kernel or as a module option.
