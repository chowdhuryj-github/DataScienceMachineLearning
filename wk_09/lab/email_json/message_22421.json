I know that the answer is in section\n7.2 of \"S Programming,\" but I don't have the book (and I plan to buy\nthe next edition---which I hope will be titled S/R programming ;-) ).\n\nI believe the following yields a standard fixed-effects estimation:\n\nfixed.effects = as.factor( as.integer( runif(100)*10 ) )\ny=rnorm(100); x=rnorm(100);\nprint(summary(lm( Y ~ X + fe)))\n\nI would like to know how to get the same coefficient on X using nlme.\n(I cannot use this ordinary lm method in my real application, simply\nbecause I have 10,000 fixed effects.)  I tried a variety of arguments\nto the \"fixed\" nlme parameter (e.g., fixed=list(fmid)), but did not\nget the syntax right.  could someone please tell me the magic spell?\n\nmay I also suggest that such an example be added to the nlme examples\ndocumentation, too, please?\n\nhelp appreciated.\n\nregards,\n\n/ivo\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
