You can increase the dpi (dots per\ninch) to enhance the relative resolution (at the expense of a larger\nfile), but the image quality is still dependent on the device upon which\nthe image is viewed. \n\nPending further information, if you need high quality output, depending\nupon the intended use, then you want to use vector based images.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
