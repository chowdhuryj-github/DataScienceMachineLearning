This case has always been about gaining clarity on\nhow innovation is valued and protected in India.  We brought the case\nforward because we firmly believe it was the right thing to do for\npatients.  It is clear that there are inadequacies in Indian patent law\nthat will have long-term consequences.\n\nAccess to Glivec in India is not threatened by this case\n\nFirstly Dr Dabade states that \"there is no explanation as to why\nNovartis is not offering different prices (for Glivec) depending on the\ncircumstances in a country like India\".  Later in the same piece he\nmakes reference to our Glivec International Patient Assistance Program\n(GIPAP).\n\nGIPAP is in fact one of the largest and most far-reaching patient\nassistance programs ever created.  Recognizing the cost of such\nmedication and the truly life saving nature of Glivec, Novartis has\ncommitted to make it available to any patient who cannot afford the\ntreatment.  This is why in India over 7,000 patients suffering from the\nrare cancers CML and GIST receive Glivec free of charge from Novartis\nthrough GIPAP for as long as they need it.  This represents 99% of the\npatients in India who are prescribed the drug.  Worldwide we provide\nfree Glivec to over 20,000 patients in more than 80 countries.  There is\nno way to say how many CML patients in India go undiagnosed, but it is\nclear that given India's healthcare spending and infrastructure nowhere\nnear all the patients suffering with CML can be diagnosed and treated.\nThat is why GIPAP goes even further than drug donation, and helps to\ntrain and support physicians to increase diagnosis and treatment of\nthese rare diseases.\n\nThere are generic versions of Glivec on the market in India currently\nand they will stay on the market regardless of the outcome of this case.\nThis is because of a clause in the Indian Patent Law (the \"Grandfather\nclause\") which allows generics on the market prior to 2005 to stay\nthere.  Novartis is not challenging this clause.  However, can these\ngenerics really solve the problem of access to medicines in India when\nthey are still priced at over 4 times the average annual salary?\n\nWhy a patent for Glivec?\n\nThe piece states that the Novartis claim for a patent for the beta\ncrystalline form of imatinib mesylate is objectionable.  The original\nmolecule imatinib was invented by Novartis in 1993, prior to India\nadopting the patent laws in place today.  Imatinib can not be formulated\nas an oral medication and therefore we developed the beta crystalline\nform of its mesylate salt.  This type of incremental innovation is what\nis at question here and exactly why we have pursued this case.  Without\nit the many of thousands of patients who have benefited from Glivec\nwould have been denied this medicine.  In fact many Indian companies\nhave made gains from exactly this type of work, patenting incremental\ninnovation, and they support this cause.  The beta crystalline form of\nimatinib mesylate has been awarded a patent in nearly 40 other\ncountries, including China and Russia, and the same should be true in\nIndia.  It is the only form of Glivec that has ever been marketed by\nNovartis.\n\nSection 3(d) and what it means\n\nNovartis as a company can not enter into the special international\ndispute redressal mechanism under WTO.  This can only be taken forward\nby the member countries of WTO.  As is our right as a company operating\nin India, we are asking a legal question through the proper mechanism,\nthe Indian legal system.\n\nWe are not challenging any of the flexibilities under TRIPS,\nspecifically the Doha Declaration, allowing production of medicines for\nexport under compulsory licenses that have been issued for public health\nreasons. They have been put in place to allow poor countries that do not\nhave sufficient local production capacity to safeguard access to medicines.\n\nAcknowledging innovation by granting a patent is unrelated to the access\nto medicines issue. Improving access to medicines is a matter of making\nmedicines available. Medicines can be made available through access\nsafeguards in international agreements and, in the case of essential and\nlife-saving medicines, special pricing arrangements in developing\ncountries can, and must, be made.\n\nAccess to medicines in the developing world is a complex problem in\nwhich medicine prices and intellectual property rights are but two\npieces of the puzzle.  A range of underlying or related issues such as\nappropriate infrastructure and distribution networks must be addressed\nin parallel.  This can only be achieved through the collaboration of all\ninvolved stakeholders working together to ensure that patients in need\nreceive proper care.\n\nFor more information on this case, including patient testimonials and\nother views, please see\nhttp://www.novartis.com/newsroom/india-glivec-patent-case/index.shtml\n\nFor more information on The MAX Foundation, the organization which runs\nGIPAP please see https://www.maxaid.org/Default.aspx?trgt=home\n\nDominic Atkins\nHead of Corporate Public Affairs\nNovartis International AG\nGlobal Public Affairs\nForum 1\nCH-4002 Basel\nSwitzerland\nPhone: +41 61 3244327\nCell: +41798203710\nEmail : dominic.atkins@novartis.com\n\n--\nMike Palmedo\nResearch Coordinator\nProgram on Information Justice and Intellectual Property\nAmerican University, Washington College of Law\n4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016\nT - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659\nmpalmedo@wcl.american.edu\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
