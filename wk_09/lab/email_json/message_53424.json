The track-and trace option only works if a LOT of receivers are installed in the museum or if every doorframe is supplied with an antenna. In all museums that I know of RFID is only used for motion detection and not for track and trace. In none of these museums RFID is used to 'reveal the exact position' of paintings, or any other objects. If Julian Bickersteth intends to follow the overseas trend he will be discover that RFID is just used as an 'old fashioned' motion detector.\nThe \"cheapest radio identifiers are still 60 or 70 cents\" he is referring to are passive tags and can only be traced when they pass very near by a reader or antenna (like in library books). Active tags that send their signal over an much longer distance are not only much bigger because of the battery that is inside, but also are much more expensive (c. ? 45,00 each). These tags may be easier to trace over a longer distance, but also are very visible for a thief and therefore most of the time easy to remove. \n\nTon Cremers\n\n++++++++++++++++++ \n\n\n\nPhoto: John Shakespeare:\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/gallery-gadgets-help-mona-lisa-keep-her-smile/2007/06/21/1182019285833.html?page=2\n\n\nTHE would-be art thief thinks he's cracked it. The gallery's security guard is patrolling elsewhere, perhaps investigating a disturbance staged as a distraction. The thief begins to unscrew the old master, planning to slip it into a bag or under his coat before melting into the weekend crowds. He knows the gallery's front door has no security scanner.\n\nBut security staff are already onto him. Motion detectors installed in the painting will detect the slightest movement. And even if they fail, a radio frequency identifier (RFID) attached to the back of the frame will help track a painting that has been removed from the wall. A signal sent every 15 seconds reveals the painting's exact position. Before he knows it, the thief is confronted, the painting saved and a gallery's reputation remains intact.\n\nAs we know, the Art Gallery of NSW had no such high-tech security when the diminutive A Cavalier (Self-Portrait), by the 17th-century Dutch artist Frans van Mieris, was stolen the Sunday before last. There wasn't even a security camera in the small room where it hung. Before long, however, such technology will not only improve gallery and museum security, it will transform the experience of visitors.\n\nJulian Bickersteth, the managing director of International Conservation Services, a Sydney museum consultancy, says Australian cultural institutions will inevitably follow the overseas trend.\n\n\"Take-up in Australia has been slow because it is not a cheap system to put in place,\" he says, noting that a bar code for a painting, for example, costs about five cents whereas the cheapest radio identifiers are still 60 or 70 cents. \"Like all these electronic things, it needs a lot of effort. And it then has to be tied into your overall security system.\n\n\"Essentially you'll have a system that is electronically checking the location of every painting in the gallery every 15 seconds, a far cry from the traditional system of guards wandering around to check they're all there.\n\n\"The sad thing about the [Art Gallery of NSW] theft is that it's not been a problem in Australia - it's been much more one in Europe and the US. But it means that here we'll have to start looking more at security,\" he says.\n\nThese advances in security technology are also transforming the gallery experience, particularly in the US. Information stored on the identifier mounted on a picture can be accessed by hand-held devices, such as PDAs, that are lent to visitors when they enter the gallery. The data can range from basic catalogue information to a video interview with the artist, and even interactive games for school-aged visitors.\n\"If you're standing in front of Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles at the National Gallery, for instance, you can have video streaming from the RFID to your PDA showing him making the work and slapping paint all over the place,\" Bickersteth says. \"Clearly there's a whole new level of visitor experience which we are going to be quickly encountering.\"\n\nTraditionalists might splutter at the thought of such high-tech add-ons and ask what's wrong with just standing in front of a painting and looking at it. It is a question Bickersteth has considered. \"The interesting issue, of course, is when are you starting to detract from the visual experience? An awful lot of people would go and stand in front of Blue Poles and just soak it up and not be distracted by all these other things.\n\n\"I think the answer is that we're moving into a new generation, and it's certainly the case with my children, where they say they want more. We have the ability to provide the gen Ys with a lot more contextual information at the touch of a button, and I think it's great, actually.\n\n\"You don't have to do it - you can just stand there and look at it - but at the same time you can find out the context. How did he paint this work? Where does it fit in? You get all those different levels.\"\n\nChanges are already happening in Australia, with online collections, podcasts and other digital resources, and Bickersteth says the evolution of web-based communities and hosted services has significant implications for cultural institutions.\n\n\"No longer is content king; now the user is king,\" he says. \"That's the paradigm that we in the museum world are coming to, that people are choosing what they want to look at and what information they want rather than just being fed the information we think they should have. We can't do anything to stop that.\n\n\"At some level, I think it's quite exciting. There's a big movement at the moment to what's called co-creation, whereby it is not just the curators who have the knowledge, it's the ability of the public to also feed them knowledge.\"\n\nHe cites the example of the Australian War Memorial's photographic collection, which is available online. \"They encourage you to go and look at that, and if you see Uncle Fred standing on the wing of a Lancaster bomber in 1944, please tell us. They then feed that information back into the collection.\"\n\nWith fine art, however, things get murkier. \"Do we really want to know what Miranda from Bondi thinks about Edmund Capon's latest acquisition? Do we want an amateur providing her views on things? But then that's when blogs are useful.\"\n\nThe biggest hurdle in Australia is its relatively slow broadband speed, especially when compared with the US. \"We've been slow in getting our cultural content onto the web, so until we've got better web content I don't think we'll see better take-up of technology in terms of contextual information provision in museums and galleries,\" Bickersteth says.\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Sat, 23 Jun 2007 12:29:39 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] U.K. Several oil paintings have been stolen from a\n\thouse in\tGodstone, Surrey, by five balaclava-clad men.\nTo: \nMessage-ID: <061801c7b581$6ad633e0$40829ba0$@org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nFive men carry out art burglary \n\nSeveral oil paintings have been stolen from a house in Godstone, Surrey, by\nfive balaclava-clad men. \nOne of the works on canvas, called Shooting Party, by George White, is\nvalued at about ?15,800, police said. \n\nAnd another painting, Portrait of Lydia Harvey, by John Heins Senior, is\nthought to be worth about ?14,000. \n\nIn an appeal for information on Thursday, officers said the break-in, at a\nproperty in Leigh Place Lane, happened between 30 and 31 May. \n\n\nStory from BBC NEWS:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/uk_news/england/surrey/6227602.stm\n\nPublished: 2007/06/21 14:29:29 GMT\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Sat, 23 Jun 2007 12:29:39 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] USA.

Kammerer, who operates the Springdale Coin and\nAntique Shop, said he bought the lithographs from Hunnicutt.\n\n\"He had some pictures he wanted to sell,\" Robert Kammerer said Wednesday of\nHunnicutt.\n\n\"We bought them not knowing they were stolen. It was a good buy.\"\n\nRobert Kammerer said he did not pay \"more than $1,000\" for the lithographs.\n\nRobert Kammerer said he and his son didn't find out until Tuesday the\nlithographs were stolen.\n\nThey found out, Robert Kammerer said, when police pulled over the van his\nson was driving and found some of the lithographs inside. They arrested Sean\nKammerer.\n\nThat arrest came less than a week after Hunnicutt pleaded guilty before\nHamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Robert Ruehlman.\n\nSean Kammerer's attorney said in court Wednesday he has \"mental issues\" and\nis easily manipulated.\n\n\"I think he was used in this case,\" said his attorney, Anna Schmalz.\n\nNeither police nor Lester returned calls Wednesday.\n\n\nhttp://news.cincinnati.com/\n____________________________________\nMuseum Security Network / Museum Security Consultancy\nPostbus 3213\n3003 AE Rotterdam\nThe Netherlands\n+31 10 2233897\n+31 6 242 246 20\ntoncremers@museum-security.org\n_______________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 5\nDate: Sat, 23 Jun 2007 12:29:39 +0200\nFrom: Museum Security Network Mailing list \nSubject: [MSN] Australia.

And they insist that this is because the two vigango were stolen\nfrom family graves. \n\nWhen Mr Mwakiru's two sons died, he erected vigango on their graves. But the\ncarved wooden statues, decorated with triangular etchings, were stolen\nshortly after. \n\nMr Mwakiru died soon afterwards, and his wife Kache Kalume Mwakiru blames\nhis death on the theft of the vigango. \n\nFestus Tinga Mwakiru, the new head of the family, says the theft of the two\nstatues is directly responsible for the family's plight. \n\n\"When the vigango were stolen, the family became sick and poor. I feel that\nI am poor because the vigango were stolen,\" he says. \n\nSong and dance \n\nThe two vigango which were returned to the Mwakiru family were found at the\nIllinois State Museum and the Hampton University Museum in Virginia. \n\n\n I expect to make money because the vigango are now back \nFestus Tinga Mwakiru  \n\nChalani village came alive with song and dance as the vigango were returned\nto the Mwakiru family and installed on the desecrated graves. \n\nOnly members of the revered Gohu Council are allowed to handle the sacred\nvigango and 10 senior elders were on hand to receive the two statues and\nerect them on the graves. \n\nThe chairman of the Gohu council, 70-year-old Kisau Mwaduna, said, \"This\nfunction is very important to us because we are witnessing the return of\nvigango. \n\n\"We have heard a lot of reports from various families in this whole region\nthat vigango are being stolen daily, this issue has been troubling us for\nmany years.\" \n\nHigh spirits \n\nMr Katana, the principal curator of the National Museums of Kenya, is a\nMijikenda and deeply values his community's beliefs and traditions. \n\n\"We believe if somebody steals it, then that person is going to be affected.\nHe might even become mad,\" Mr Katana said during the ceremony. \n\n\"If you steal a vigango, it is going to come back to you because the vigango\nis somebody's spirit.

En effet,\napr?s la disparition d'une quarantaine d'ex-voto de grande valeur ?\nBouc-Bel-Air, les enqu?teurs ne disposaient d'aucune piste pour r?soudre\nl'affaire.\n\nCes tableaux qui dataient du XVIIe si?cle, offerts en remerciement d'un voeu\nexauc?, ?taient tous entrepos?s dans la tour du ch?teau, situ? dans le\ncentre du village. En octobre 2006, on avait d?couvert leur disparition. Pas\nd'indice ni de trace, aucune piste. Impossible de savoir pr?cis?ment quand\nces oeuvres avaient ?t? d?rob?s. Et surtout, par qui. Un minutieux travail\nde b?n?dictin avait alors ?t? op?r? pour r?pertorier un ? un tous les\ntableaux vol?s. Pr?judice estim?: 56000 euros. \n\nC'est en avril dernier que tout s'acc?l?re: un gendarme du Service technique\nde renseignement judiciaire et de documentation, o? sont centralis?s les\nfichiers en r?gion parisienne, rep?re sur internet l'un des tableaux vol?s ?\nBouc. L'oeuvre figure sur un c?l?bre site d'ench?res par internet. Il fait\naussit?t plusieurs recherches pour retrouver des personnes susceptibles de\nfournir des renseignements sur les tableaux. Et c'est une collectionneuse\nqu?b?coise qui fait ?voluer l'enqu?te: elle a d?j? fait l'acquisition de\ntrois d'entre eux.\n\n\"Cette personne ?tait de bonne foi, persuad?e que les oeuvres qu'elles\navaient achet?es provenaient d'un r?seau licite\", explique une source proche\nde l'enqu?te. Les militaires parviennent rapidement, gr?ce ? la\ncollaboration de cette collectionneuse, ? retrouver la trace d'un individu\noriginaire du Vaucluse, qui ?volue dans le milieu artistique. A son\ndomicile, les gendarmes retrouvent quatorze ex-voto. \n\nL'homme dit les avoir achet?s chez un interm?diaire avant de commencer ? les\nrestaurer pour les revendre ensuite 3000 euros la pi?ce. La majorit? des\ntableaux vol?s se trouvaient en effet en assez mauvais ?tat, jamais r?nov?s\ndepuis leur ?poque d'origine. L'homme originaire du Vaucluse aurait\nrembours? la collectionneuse qu?b?coise. L'enqu?te men?e par la brigade de\ngendarmerie de Bouc-Bel-Air se poursuit pour retrouver les 26 autres ex-voto\nd?rob?s dans le ch?teau de Bouc, ainsi que les malfaiteurs qui les avaient\nvol?s.\nPar S?verine Pardini ( spardini@laprovence-presse.fr )\n\nhttp://www.laprovence.fr/\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 148\n****************************************\n\n"}
