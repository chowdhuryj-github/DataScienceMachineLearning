The more you can do without sighted help, the better.  I\nhave to bust all my computing problems without sighted help, which I\ndo not have the luxury of anyway.  My wife, though sighted, knows\nnothing about computers and, showing her the messages or whatever,\nwould do no more than get her confused.  \n\nWell, I just got the start of one going the other day.  I have decided\nto give gnome and orca a try.  I may or may not regret this.  I would\nlike to get some results from others on how you are doing with this\ncombination.  I would like to see what's going on.  If you are having\ngood or bad results with speech-enabled Linux gui interfaces, please\nlet me know so that I will know what to look forward to.  \n\n\n\nThanks \n\n\n\n\n-- \nSpie Smith: C.S.F.C.\nComputer Scientist For CHRIST\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
