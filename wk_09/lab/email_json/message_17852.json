If you don't, \nthere's always the possibility that you are a student asking us to do \nyour homework for you, or that you really should hire someone to do your \nprogramming.\n\nMy response may have seemed rude, but I thought at the time that it \nwould have been more rude to ignore the question completely.  In my \njudgment the original answer was sufficient, and the followups showed \nthat Mr./Ms. Anonymous wasn't willing to put a reasonable effort into \nsolving the problem her/himself.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n\n> \n> On 4/27/07, xpRt.wannabe  wrote:\n>> Is this an ad hominem comment or a comment of brevity?
