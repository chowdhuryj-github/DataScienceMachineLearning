I attached a patch that affects objects.c, vtables.c,\n> gc/register.c and stm/waitlist.c.\n\nI have looked at the 'more_memory.patch' and I'm wondering about the\nportability.\nIn that patch loops where pointers are explicitly set to NULL\nare replaced with a  \n  memset( start, 0, len);\n\nWhat happens when NULL is not a consective series of '\\0' chars?\nAre there such platforms and are they releavant for parrot?\n\n-- \n/* Bernhard.Schmalhofer  at gmx.de */\n\n"}
