I remember some discussion\non the bzr ml so I'll try to fig it up from there.\n\n> * What is the status of bzr repositories and cheap branching?\n\nAfter reading http://bazaar-vcs.org/SharedRepositoryTutorial,\nit appears that bzr repositories are designed as a space saver\nwhen branches share portions of revision history.  But you still\nhave to checkout each branch at a time unlike git-clone\nwhich pulls all branches (or at least their history) at one time.\n\nThe bzrtools \"switch\" command allows to swap between lightweight\ncheckouts (think a cvs or svn checkout) created by 'bzr branch'\nBut this is basically a shortcut for 'cd new_branch && bzr update\"\nthe way I understand it.  No real new functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGgISNIR7qMdg1EfYRAikRAJ9dnLQ/OwsVv0vb+H3cQmRm0ypkPgCfaSo3\nsOW949mUwa9alhKYrW0aAKw=\n=9huP\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
