This is\nmy first time to write a script for use by others and am learning that\nit isn't as easy as it seems.\n\nTo the issue. My script runs fine on my machine and on a server I have\naccess to, but a user has written me saying that it crashes the first\ntime the function \"cov\" is called up. Below is her error message\nfollowed by the version of R she's using.\n\nCan anyone help me out here? I can't recreate her error message. Does\nanyone know what this might have to do with? Is it a version issue\n(she's using R 2.1)? I'd appreciate any help!!\n\nMatt\n\n\nERROR MESSAGE:\n\ncov.varcomp <- cov(t(effects.cur[c(\"A\",\"AA\",\"D\",\"F\",\"S\",\"E\",\"AGE\",\"AGE.by.A\"),]*beta2))\n\nthere is an argument mssing.\nerror message:\n\nError in mean((a - mean(a)) * (b - mean(b))) :\n       argument \"b\" is missing, with no default\n\n\nSPECIFICS OF HER MACHINE:\n\n> memory.size()\n[1] 10985480\n> R.Version()\n$platform\n[1] \"i386-pc-mingw32\"\n$arch\n[1] \"i386\"\n$os\n[1] \"mingw32\"\n$system\n[1] \"i386, mingw32\"\n$status\n[1] \"\"\n$major\n[1] \"2\"\n$minor\n[1] \"1.0\"\n$year\n[1] \"2005\"\n$month\n[1] \"04\"\n$day\n[1] \"18\"\n$language\n[1] \"R\"\n> .Platform\n$OS.type\n[1] \"windows\"\n$file.sep\n[1] \"/\"\n$dynlib.ext\n[1] \".dll\"\n$GUI\n[1] \"Rgui\"\n$endian\n[1] \"little\"\n$pkgType\n[1] \"win.binary\"\n\n-- \nMatthew C Keller\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nVirginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
