The conference is filled with case study presentations to enable attendees to learn from the successes and challenges of others. The conference brings together experiences of both regulated and non-regulated utilities to share marketing ideas and strategies that have been successful.\n\u00a0\nThis conference addresses four main components:\n\u00a0\n\n\nUsing technology to effectively segment target markets\n\nDetermining new products and services for commercial and industrial customers\n\nEmerging products and services for residential markets\n\nLeveraging the contact center to deliver new products and services to customers\n\n                        Each session has case study presentations to help you decide which products and services to offer in order to grow your business and promote customer satisfaction. Learn what you can do to offer new products and services, re-offer old products and services in a new regulatory environment, or revitalize current product and service offerings by using new marketing technology, partnering with external companies, and partnering with internal organizations.\n\n\n\u00a0\nAttendees learn from the experiences of nine companies, answering such critical questions as:\n\u00a0\n\nHow do we choose which product or service to launch?\n\nHow much investment should we make toward product development?\n\nHow closely should we factor market research into our product design?\n\nHow will we launch the product and get customer attention?\n\nWhat response rate represents a success?\n\nHow can we launch new products and services with a minimal investment?\n\nHow does revenue generated benefit a regulated utility?\n\nHow can we identify customer needs to fit our abilities?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTARGET AUDIENCE\n\u00a0\nThe target audience for this conference includes:\n\u00a0\n\n\nVice Presidents of Marketing\n\nGeneral Managers, Directors, and Project Managers involved in Marketing, Marketing Analytics, Market Research, Customer Strategies, Market Planning & Research and/or Business Development\n\nDirectors and Managers of Products & Services\n\nAnalysts and Planners in Strategic Marketing\n\nManagers of Key Accounts\n\nCustomer Services and Marketing\n\nProduct Development and Consumer Product Marketing\n\nContact Center Management\n\n\n\nWHAT PAST ATTENDEES HAVE SAID:\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs a new employee in the utility industry, this conference packed three months of training into two days.\u201d~ B.C., Market Analyst, Dominion\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe EUCI conference on developing and launching new products and services provided several thought provoking ideas and concepts warranting further investigation withinmy company\u2019s business model.
