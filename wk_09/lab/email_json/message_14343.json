The configure.am only insists on 1.3.21.\n\nAre you using Python 2.5? Maybe that has something to do with it, and \nmakes it require the latest version of SWIG.\n\nNot that you don't know, but I forgot to mention you should cd to \nsugar-jhbuild and run \"./sugar-jhbuild shell\" to get all the environment \nvariables set that will get you python 2.5, before running any of the \nconfiguration of building commands.\n\nHere's a message I googled that suggests the error your getting is \ncaused by an old version of SWIG -- so I guess I should fix the \nconfigure.ac to insist on the required version (1.3.31 works for me):\n\nhttp://projects.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2007-January/006568.html\n\nI should have elaborated.  The problem is caused by using an older\nversion of SWIG to generate the wrappers.  As Robert Kern pointed out\nin a previous thread:\n\n\"\"\"\nPlease use SWIG CVS to generate those files. Most of the errors that Nils\nreported are from non-const-preserving assignments in the SWIG runtime\nfunctions. g++ 4 is stricter about those than g++ 3. SWIG CVS corrects those\nproblems.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIt appears that Apple's g++4 is more sensitive to this issue than\nother those in other distributions.\n\n\nWhen generating the SWIG wrappers for sparsetools, be sure to use the\nmost recent version of SWIG (i.e. the one currently in svn).\n\n\nBert Freudenberg wrote:\n>\n> On Apr 24, 2007, at 13:04 , Don Hopkins wrote:\n>\n>> http://www.DonHopkins.com/home/cam.tgz\n>>\n>> The way to build and run it is:\n>>\n>> Untar the \"cam\" directory into your \"sugar-jhbuild/source\" directory.\n>> Go into the directory \"sugar-jhbuild/source/cam\".\n>> Edit the file autogen-sugar.sh to contain the absolute path to your \n>> sugar-jhbuild directory.\n>> Run the script \"./autogen-sugar.sh\" to configure the project.\n>> Build and install the project with \"make install\".\n>\n> Fails because it depends on SWIG.
