Why not?\n\nWhat do you mean by 'likes'? As far as I can see both will work, but neither will\ndo what you expect of them.\n\nThe hash solution has been mentioned, but it may be more appropriate to use\narray references without the containing hash:\n\nforeach my $vm (\\@Exchange, \\@Filter, \\@DNS, \\@Domain) {\n  my_sub(@$vm);\n  print \"@$vm\\n\";\n}\n\n(I am calling the reference $vm because you did and it presumably means\nsomething to you, unlike the rest of the world :)\n\nHTH,\n\nRob\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
