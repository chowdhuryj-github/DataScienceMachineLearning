If I associate a boolean, 0\nor 1, with each item, I can constrain the sum of the boolean to be\nequal to 100. But how do I then further specify the other constraints\n(on the sum of B and the sum of C) and the objective function (to\nmaximise the sum of A) ?\n\nThanks,\nTolga\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
