This one isn't so easy to watch: \n      it's\u00a0a home video of \n      the\u00a0\"Baywatch\" and\u00a0\"Knight Rider\" star in \n      which he appears to be flat-out drunk. The timing is interesting: \n      Hasselhoff is in the middle of a\u00a0contentious divorce and custody \n      battle.\u00a0\"Entertainment \n      Tonight\"\u00a0is covering the story, and I'm sure we'll hear more \n      in the days ahead.\nIf that video isn't \n      enough to scare people off drinking too much this weekend, in this \n      morning's Health Watch a substance abuse expert told us about a study that \n      shows drinking \n      a lot of alcohol could actually shrink your brain.\nAnd if you want \n      to\u00a0meet a guy who's just high \n      on life,\u00a0Dave was live \n      from\u00a0Royal Caribbean's new cruise \n      ship, The Liberty of the Seas, this morning.\u00a0He went surfing \n      in the ship's wave pool -- well, \"surfing\" \n      might be an overstatement. But he sure was fun to \n      watch.\nJoin \n      us tomorrow for\u00a0to learn how to make \n      a complete Cinco de Mayo party for \n      under $40; take a look at some of the new high-tech wrinkle cures; hear about a fascinating\u00a0new \n      book, \"The Myth of Happiness,\" and, \n      to top it all off,\u00a0\u00a0take \n      in a performance by Carly Simon!
