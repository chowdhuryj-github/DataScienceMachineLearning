However, when I ran the k-means on four clusters it gave me the means for each result with the number of each cluster e.g.\n    variable1\n1  33.33\n2  12.00\n3 109.00\n4  67.98\n\nSo I know for instance cluster 1 has a mean for variable1 of 33.33, however when I run PAM i get:\n      variable 1\n29    32\n97    12\n308  106\n217  62\n\nDoes 29 relate to cluster 1,  and 97 to cluster2 etc.\n\nHope this makes sense,\n\nNathaniel\n\n\n      ___________________________________________________________ \n\nyour free account today http://uk.rd.yahoo.com/evt=44106/*http://uk.docs.yahoo.com/mail/winter07.html \n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
