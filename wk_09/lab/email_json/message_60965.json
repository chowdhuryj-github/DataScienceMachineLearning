When loading required dependencies I got the following error message:\n\nError in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :\n        unable to load shared library '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/optmatch/libs/optmatch.so':\n  /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/optmatch/libs/optmatch.so: cannot map zero-fill pages: Cannot allocate memory\nError: package/namespace load failed for 'optmatch'\n\noptmatch.so appears to be where R is looking for it so I don't know what has gone wrong.   Have I missed something in the installation process, or is this a known Ubuntu problem, or a licensing issue?  Should I direct this question to the maintainer?\n\nI have installed MatchIt along with optmatch on a WinXP Pro system without any problem.   Any assistance/suggestions are welcome.  I running R-2.5.1 and downloading packages from the CRAN mirror at FHCRC in Seattle, WA, USA.\n\nDan\n\nDaniel Nordlund\nBothell, WA USA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
