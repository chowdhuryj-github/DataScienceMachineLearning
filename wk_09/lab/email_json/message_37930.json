Variable names in Perl identify what kind of variable they\nare.  @ for arrays, % for hashes.

That's the point of the language being open-\nsource, after all.  Far more people are going to see those documents\nthan will ever see your post to beginners@perl.org, so if you're aim\nis really to help out new Perl programmers, improving the\ndocumentation is the best approach.\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
