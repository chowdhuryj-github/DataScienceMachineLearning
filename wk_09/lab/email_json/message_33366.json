If you then make foo.xml.gz the encoding declaration (when decompressed) says exactly the same thing. The fact that is been gzipped is conveyed out of band, in the http headers:\n\nContent-Encoding: gzip\n\nThere is scope for confusion, since XML uses 'encoding' for 'character encoding' (although that's a big advance on calling it 'charset'). HTTP uses content-encoding. The two uses of the concept 'encoding' occur at different levels in the stack.\n\nIn consequence, using gzip content-encoding is compatible with +xml media types.\n\n\n-- \n Chris Lilley                    mailto:chris@w3.org\n Interaction Domain Leader\n Co-Chair, W3C SVG Working Group\n W3C Graphics Activity Lead\n Co-Chair, W3C Hypertext CG\n\n"}
