(GSS) is up an incredible 37% in less than two months\nMicrovision Inc (MVIS) is up 18% in just two weeks\nEOG Resources Inc (EOG) is up 11% in four months\nSuncor Energy (SU) is up 11% in just three weeks\n\nAnd those are just a few of the winners I selected for you Trade Talkers recently!\u00a0  Trending123 subscribers know there\u2019s a whole lot more where they came from.\u00a0  Find out about the complete Trending123 portfolio and its winners\u2014PLUS get in on the most recent recommended plays right here.\n\n\n\n\nNo, this wasn\u2019t some weird Trending123 version of the Rorschach test.\u00a0  I simply wanted to gauge the temperature of your emotions right now.\u00a0  Because from the emails I have been receiving and from the overarching tone that I have found in the trading room and on the message boards lately, some of you are going a little over-the-edge!\nYes, we are in a highly volatile place right now in the market.\u00a0  Chart after chart is showing the RST/Nut Hut pattern.\u00a0  Heck, I don\u2019t call it the \u201cNut Hut\u201d for no reason!\u00a0  This pattern comes with some serious psychological highs and lows.\u00a0  It is bound to drive most people batty now and again.\u00a0  So, yes, if you are one of them, you can relax (somewhat) as you realize that these feelings are completely normal.\nHowever, for those of you that are still tensing up, this message is for you (dun, dun, dun)!\u00a0  Please do not allow yourself to get so caught up in this tangled web of emotions to the point where you cannot enjoy what is happening.\u00a0  We are experiencing a plethora of amazing highs from sectors and indices far and wide right now.\nIt\u2019s truly mind-blowing!\u00a0  Last week I brought up charts for the Paris CAC ($CAC) to the German DAX ($DAX) to the Dow Jones World Index ($DJW) to the New York Stock Exchange ($NYA).\u00a0  These and many others were experiencing 52-weeks and all-time highs.\u00a0  Man, oh, man. It\u2019s such an exciting time right now.\n\nAND\u2026AND\u2026if that\u2019s not proof enough, then how about real stocks that are doing real(ly) well?\u00a0  Here at Trending123, we are in so many stocks that are doing exceptionally well.\nAnd as new subscribers continue to pour in, the question is always the same, \u201cCan I still profit from these opportunities?\u201d The answer is still a resounding, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlanco Technologies, Inc. (ALAN)\nAlanco Technologies, Inc., through its subsidiaries, engages in the design, production, marketing, and distribution of radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking technology and data storage products primarily in the United States.\u00a0  It develops TSI PRISM, a wireless RFID tracking technology that is used primarily in correctional facilities, security management, and personnel monitoring.\nCurrent Outlook: Right now, this stock is in an Ascending Triangle pattern and it simply looks prepped to break out at a moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0  There was massive volume falling the recent holiday weekend which contributed to its current activity.\u00a0  The weekly chart is showing massive bullish divergence with all the indicators pointing up and the PPO, possibly even making new parabolic highs.\u00a0  So this is a stock that I think will really start cranking!\n\n\n\nFalconStor Software (FALC)\nFalconStor Software, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of network storage software solutions, as well as provision of related maintenance, implementation, and engineering services worldwide.\u00a0  Its software products include Network Storage Server that provides storage networking and business continuity/disaster recovery functionality to enterprises, small and medium-size business, and small office/home office markets; Virtualtape Library, a backup/recovery solution that uses disk to emulate a range of physical tape libraries; and Continuous Data Protection solutions that maintain the availability and usability of data in the event of an unplanned hardware failure, deletion, or software error, or planned downtime.\nCurrent Outlook: Right now, FALC is flying its bull flag proud!\u00a0  It is showing massive bullish divergence thanks to the volume.\u00a0  And if you get in on a day with a marked pullback, you can practically count on a double from it in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Janice Dorn, a Neuropsychological Trading Coach, works with me at Trending123, focusing on trading, mentoring and commentary in the financial markets, with emphasis on Behavioral NeuroFinance, Mass Psychology and Trading Neuropsychology.\u00a0  You can find her in our Trading Room and on our message boards, and each week she writes a Trading Wisdom column for my subscribers.\n\nSelf-Sabotage: The Great Deceiver\nEveryone wants to be a winner, to make the big bucks, to see tons of good trades.\u00a0  No one really wants to believe that he or she is sabotaging success.\u00a0  Yet, 90% of traders wipe out completely in the first year, and the majority are simply unable to deal with the truth.\u00a0  Their denial is self-sabotage.\nThe highest rung on the ladder of self-sabotage is what is called \u201covertrading.\u201d\u00a0  But that\u2019s just another way of saying that the trader is compulsive, obsessive and addicted.\u00a0  Trading addiction occurs in many people and at all levels of trading skills.\u00a0  Addiction is a brain disease.\u00a0  It is a behavioral situation that is subserved by electrochemical changes in the brain.\u00a0  Talking for years, psychopharmacology, rehabilitation in some facility, or five hours a day of intense sauna or steam might help, but in the end, the only way to deal with addiction is for the addict to stop the behavior.\nHistory is littered with examples, but among my favorites is the tale of Nick Leeson.\u00a0  In the early \u201890s, Leeson gained full charge of the Singapore office of Barings Bank, one of the most venerable financial institutions in the world and bank of the Queen of England.\u00a0  (Barings financed the Louisiana Purchase, the Erie Canal and the Napoleonic Wars.)\u00a0  There was just one small problem: Leeson was an inveterate liar.\u00a0  Almost from the first day he went to Singapore to run the Barings Operation, he was losing money on trades and hiding it in an error account numbered \u201c88888.\u201d\u00a0  His justification was, \u201cI never encountered anything I could not conquer.\u201d\u00a0  But the losses just kept growing.\nThe morning of February 26, 1995, the 233-year-old bank was hours away from total collapse due to losses of $1 billion incurred by Nick, age 28.\u00a0  It was sold for one British pound to the Dutch Bank ING.\nWhat\u2019s the lesson we can learn from Nick?\u00a0  As I said above, the addict must make a total commitment to abstinence.\nBut I\u2019m certainly not suggesting you abstain from trading altogether.\u00a0  Trending123 is here to help keep your emotions in check.\u00a0  John Lansing is in the trenches with you day in and day out in the live trading room, where he talks about his views, stock/sector picks and general interpretation of market activity.\u00a0  That said, for my part, the really fascinating stuff has to do with what people in the room write about and how they express their thoughts and emotions during the trading day.\u00a0  But for those of you who do not have time or inclination to join the trading room, regular visits to the message board might be something to consider.\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many reasons to be optimistic and yet, somehow, many of you are allowing the Bears of the market to seep into your psyche.\u00a0  Just look at how the S&P 500 is doing right now.\u00a0  It is zooming to new highs all the time and yet, have you heard the mumblings and grumblings from those that are convinced we are going to just tank?\n\u201cThe sky is falling!\u00a0  The sky is falling!\u201d\nNo it\u2019s really not.\u00a0  Nothing could be further from the truth.\nBetween Silly and Desperate\nIt is okay to be a cautious trader.\u00a0  It is not okay to convince yourself that you deserve to lose.\nDon\u2019t know what I mean?\u00a0  Well, there are a lot of people that subscribe to the \u201cI deserve to lose\u201d thought process.\u00a0  When we are at the top trend line, we are higher than a kite.\u00a0  But when we are at the bottom trend line, we are feeling like the scum of the earth \u2014 and like we deserve to lose.\nTalk about self-destructive!\nNo one deserves to lose.\u00a0  We only feel that way because the volatility that we are experiencing is incredibly strong.\u00a0  And then we let our emotions get the best of us and all of a sudden we are headed down the slippery slope toward feeling we are getting what was coming to us.\nBut it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\nAnd that\u2019s why you have me\u2014your market-o-meter!\u00a0  I can help you see through all the stuff that clouds your vision when it comes to these hectic times in the market.\u00a0  Specifically, my duty is to help you make money in spite of your best efforts to fight me on it.\nLet me help get you through it\u2014get my Trending123 at a special deal today only!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\n\nP.S. Do the words \u201cTechnical analysis\u201d frighten you?\u00a0  Don\u2019t let them!\u00a0  No one knows everything about technical analysis\u2014but the trick is that you don\u2019t have to.\u00a0  I am here for the sole purpose of helping you wade through the ups, downs, ins and outs of charting stocks.\u00a0  This is exactly why why I created Trending123.\u00a0  We are a community of traders helping other traders.\u00a0  Join our community today and discover the benefit of helping others profit while you profit!\u00a0  Click here now.\n\n\n\n\nMANAGE YOUR INVESTORPLACE ACCOUNT:\nWe hope this timely investing advice is valuable to you.
