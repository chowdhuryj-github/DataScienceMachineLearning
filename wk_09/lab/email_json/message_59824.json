I've got very interesting\nresults based on your suggestions.\n\nOne more question,  how to handle unequal variance problme in lm()?\nIsn't the weights option also, which means weighted least squares,\nright?  Can you give me an example of setting this parameter in lm()\nto account for  different variance assumption in each group?\n\nThanks again,\nShirley\n\n\nOn 6/29/07, Spencer Graves  wrote:\n> \n>\n> shirley zhang wrote:\n> > Hi Simon,\n> >\n> > Thanks for your reply.
