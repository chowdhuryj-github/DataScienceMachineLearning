They cannot be uninvented. But they can be taken out of the gun.\n\nWhen great changes occur in history, when great principles are involved, as a rule the majority are wrong.\n\nMen at sometime are the masters of their fate.\n\nAgainst you I will fling myself, unvanquished and unyielding, O Death!\n\nOur friends don't see our faults, or conceal them, or soften them.\n\nFaith... is the art of holding on to things your reason once accepted, despite your changing moods.\n\n\n"}
