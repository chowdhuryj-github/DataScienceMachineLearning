If certain vtable methods \ncan share the same implementation, it would be nice to be able to re-use a \nsingle implementation through some mechanism other than copy and paste.\n\nIt seems to me the question of whether a specific PIR sub is usable as a \nvtable method is a separate question of how else I might be able to use that \nPIR sub in the rest of the code.\n\n-- c\n\n"}
