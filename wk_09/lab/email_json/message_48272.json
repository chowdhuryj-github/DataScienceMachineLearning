Also, if all you want to do is show your boss that people\nare not doing their jobs you can simply run\n\nselect updated_by, last_updated, count(*)\nfrom tablename\nwhere field_that_should_not_be_null is null\ngroup by updated_by, last_updated\norder by last_updated, updated_by;\n\nOr better yet, modify the schema to make that column not nullable\n(which it should be if null is not a valid value).\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
