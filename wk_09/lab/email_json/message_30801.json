E.g. the \nWindows binary was only built yesterday afternoon.)\n\n>\n> -Scott\n>\n> ---- Original message ----\n>> Date: Wed, 16 May 2007 09:32:44 +0200\n>> From: Martin Maechler \n>> Subject: Re: [R] Reshape a sparse matrix\n>> To: Scott Hyde \n>> Cc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>>\n>>>>>>> \"Scott\" == Scott Hyde \n>>>>>>>     on Tue, 15 May 2007 17:03:13 -1000 (HST) writes:\n>>\n>>    Scott> Hi,\n>>\n>>    Scott> I'd like to reshape a sparse matrix generated from the Matrix package.
