After omitting the NAs, you have still duplicated time\nstamps, hence the warning is issued again. After that, aggregating works\nfine and produces no warnings.\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
