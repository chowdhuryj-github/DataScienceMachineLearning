Instead, a couple of thoughts:\n\n1. It has always been my understanding that comments intimately relate\nto documentation, despite being part of Perl's syntax.  As such, they\nare a technical violation of this \"separation of Church and State\",\nbeing State-sponsored religion as it were. (Who'd have thought that\nwe'd be talking politics and religion on a programming language\nmailing list?  Egad!)  Not that I'm advocating the removal of\ncomments; their sheer practical value makes up for their heathen ways.\n\n2. Getting block comments to hide POD blocks wouldn't require the POD\nparser to have a full implementation of a Perl parser.  It would\nrequire the POD parser to have a _limited_ implementation of a Perl\nparser, one that's capable of identifying block comments.  And IIRC,\nyou already have to do something like this with respect to block\nquotes:\n\n  say :to(END);\n  =begin POD\n  blah blah blah\n  =end POD\n  END\n\nIf I understand matters correctly, the \"POD code\" in the above example\nisn't POD code at all, but rather the content of a multi-line quote.\nSo extending the POD parser's awareness of Perl syntax to handle block\ncomments as well isn't much of a stretch.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
