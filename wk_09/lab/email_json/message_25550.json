I have a matrix of 20 variables (380000 observations each).\nI am trying to fit using \"2SLS\" in Systemfit because I want to be able\nto simulate new observations with the resulting model. The first\nproblem I found is that it ran out of memory given that I have 2GB of\nRAM. How can I circumvent this? Can I do some mixing or bootstrapping\nwith small sample each time instead?Another problem is I got\nsystem is computationally singular when I reduce the size of\nobservation to 100000 instead of 380000. Any help would be appreciated.\nI think my variables are not really well correlated to that extent. adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
