Again,\nwithout having looked at the swspeak script you run after boot, I'd\nsuspect that it loads up speechd-up, and does whatever wasn't done\nduring boot, though I do wonder if what the swspeak script does\ncouldn't be done as part of the boot process, if swspeak is found on\nthe isolinux command-line, instead of having to run another script\nafter boot.\n\nGreg\n\n\n\nOn Sun, May 27, 2007 at 01:29:22PM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hiya,\n>     I've successfully installed GRML to my hard disk.  Software speech seems to work quite well now, though the need to add an extra command at the end puzzles me.  What exactly is swspeak supposed to do?  Can I automate it?  Is there a way to make this system more Debian-like?\n> Thanks muchly,\n> Zack.\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGWfn57s9z/XlyUyARAljLAJ4wogjvqaqVx1otr8ntO4GZGLPChACfdBa4\n/NS4FHd0RT+Supt86UDQplQ=\n=rFvM\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
