Could the fact I'm using a software \nsynthesizer have something to do with this?  Is this a bug fixed in later \nSpeakup versions?\nThanks,\nZack.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Adam Myrow\" \nTo: \"'Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.'\" \n\nSent: Saturday, April 21, 2007 5:11 PM\nSubject: RE: Stopping Speakup while using Gnome.\n\n\n> You have to kill Speakup after you start Gnome.
