Do you have an hint for me please?\n\nAssuming you want to overlay multiple data sets on the same axes, verify \nthat in your first plot statement you got your axis ranges wide enough to \ncapture all your data sets, because they won't adjust when you add data.\n\nIf you want adjacent plots in the same window, use lattice (trellis) graphics.\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJeff Newmiller                        The     .....       .....
