Is \nthere any way in the perl script we can set some Magical Header :) by \nwhich the mail goes to INBOX only. First of all can we do in the perl \nscript or is it something I need to do in my Mail server. Please help...\n\nThanks\nAnish\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
