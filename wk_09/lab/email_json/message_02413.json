Pointers would be welcome.\n\nThat notwithstanding, as far as my understanding of trademark law goes,\nthere's no way that you can allow unrestricted logo use while retaining\na trademark. If there was a discussion in Debian that ran in the\nopposite direction, I think at least a GR would be required to waive\nthe trademark.\n\n\nBest,\n--Toni++\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
