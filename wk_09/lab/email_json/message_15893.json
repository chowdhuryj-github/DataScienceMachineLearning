Related to a new survey application, these components share a number of similarities -- and with accelerated timelines and high prizes, they're a great opportunity to complete multiple projects at once and take a large share of the $2,250 in prize money. \n\nHere are the projects and their first-place prizes. For more details on each, see below.\n \n* Java Survey Persistence ($800)\n* Java Survey Content ($600)\n* Java Survey Manager ($500)\n* Java Survey Servlet ($600)\n\nLearn more here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewActiveContests&ph=113\n\nComponent details:\n\n* Survey Persistence: Provides standard CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) operations for entities defined in the Survey Model component.  The component provides a pluggable persistence interface and an implementation for Microsoft SQL Server 2005.\n\n* Survey Content: Generates dynamic content based on pre-defined messages and rules. These messages can include fixed text from a configuration file or dynamic text from Responses in the Session object.  This component will be used to displayed user-customized content in a survey.\n\n* Survey Manager: Stores Surveys, which are each made up of any number of Pages.  Each page contains questions, dynamic content, attributes, validation requirements and UI style information.  This is a simple component that provides the Survey/Page model classes and logic for creating these objects from a configuration file.\n\n* Survey Servlet: The Survey Servlet component provides a web-based front end for the application.  It utilizes the other components for the bulk of the logic and primarily implements the UI logic \\ufffd such as question presentation, response parsing and response validation.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
