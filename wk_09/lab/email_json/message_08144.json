I'll check in a fix for this in qooxdoo's trunk, and when\nqooxdoo 0.7 is released and I upgrade SWAT to use it, we'll have the fix here\ntoo.\n\nThe comment you found in the code still applies, but I'm now tracking the\nfirst state in a separate variable rather than depending on finding it as the\nfirst value discovered by iterating the object properties.\n\nCheers,\n\nDerrell\n\n"}
