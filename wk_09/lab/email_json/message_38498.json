The patient under quarantine\n  \u2013 an unidentified Georgia\n  man \u2013 is infected with a rare and dangerous form of tuberculosis, and\n  may have exposed passengers and crew of two trans-Atlantic flights. Nancy\n  Cordes will have the story and our Dr. Jon LaPook will tell you more about\n  how tuberculosis could be having a dangerous comeback.\n\u00a0\nAs we honored America\u2019s\n  fallen soldiers on Memorial Day, violence in Iraq\n  killed at least 10 U.S.\n  troops, making May the deadliest month for our soldiers in Iraq this\n  year. Lara Logan will report on the recent violence and have an exclusive\n  interview with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.\n\u00a0\nAnd attacks on U.S. forces could be on the rise by\n  the end of summer. David Martin will have an update on the troop surge in Iraq\n  and what that could mean for the violence there.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, extremely dry conditions are straining\n  the Southeast United States \u2013 causing\n  neighbors to turn in neighbors for violating water restrictions and prompting\n  churchgoers to pray for rain. But what\u2019s behind this suddenly severe\n  drought? Kelly Cobiella will explain.\n\u00a0\nIn certain parts of the Midwest,\n  trees are pulsing with the rhythm of hundreds of thousands of cicadas. Chicago\u2019s suburbs\n  are in the midst of the reawakening of a certain brood of cicadas that only hatches\n  once every 17 years. Michelle Miller is there, and will have the story of the\n  moment these cicadas have been waiting for.\n\u00a0\nAnd tonight we\u2019ll have a special report from\n  correspondent Kimberly Dozier, who is making her return to the CBS Evening\n  News by reporting on the new crop of Iraq war wounds and the suffering\n  they\u2019re causing patients. And later tonight, Dozier will be telling the\n  story of the attack that hit her CBS News crew one year ago.\n  \u201cFlashpoint,\u201d a one-hour special, will air tonight on CBS at 10\n  p.m. ET/PT.
