A lion is made up of the lambs he's digested, and I've been reading all my life.\n\nThe most important function of the university in an age of reason is to protect reason from itself.\n\nI never lost a game. I just ran our of time.\n\nThis is the great fault of wine it first trips up the feet: it is a cunning wrestler.\n\nDon't borrow money from a neighbor or a friend, but of a stranger where, paying for it you shall hear of it no more.\n\nHappiness can exist only in acceptance.\n\nWhy do you have to a nonconformist like everybody else?\n\nThe more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success.\n\nFriendship makes prosperity brighter, while it lightens adversity by sharing its grieves and anxieties.\n\nHow shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense, and love the offender, yet detest the offence?\n\n\n"}
