I want to say happy Father's Day to my Dad, my father-in-law and for being a father to my two sons. So thanks.\"\n\n\"I'd like to echo the same words,\" Swanson called. \"Thanks for reminding me.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Reilly said, \"a lot of fathers on this flight and we're all enjoying a great Father's Day.\"\n\nThe excursion began at 12:25 p.m. and ended with the start of airlock repressurization at 6:54 p.m. This was the fourth and final spacewalk for the Atlantis astronauts, pushing the crew's total to 27 hours and 58 minutes. Forrester and Swanson logged a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes for the second and fourth EVAs while Reilly and Danny Olivas put in 14 hours and 13 minutes during the first and third outings.\n\nOverall, this was the 87th spacewalk devoted to space station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998. With today 's EVA, 48 U.S. astronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and four astronauts representing Japan, Germany, France and Sweden have logged 537 hours and three minutes of EVA time building and maintaining the space station.\n\nThe primary goal of today's spacewalk was an inspection of the drive motors on the starboard solar alpha rotary joint - SARJ - on the right side of the station's main solar power truss; removal of a final few launch locks to permit free rotation; stowage of a keel pin used to anchor the S3/24 truss element in the shuttle's cargo bay during launch; and installation of a safety stop on the end of the track used by the station's robot arm-carrying mobile transporter.\n\nThe spacewalkers also ran a computer cable that eventually will permit astronauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian segment. They opened a newly installed hydrogen valve that is part of a new U.S. oxygen generation system and attempted to bolt down a micrometeoroid debris shield that could not be put back in place during an earlier spacewalk. Swanson and Forrester were not able to get it anchored, either, so they used tethers to lash it down.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
