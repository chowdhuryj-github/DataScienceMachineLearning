If anyone knows an easier way, then\nI'd still be glad to hear from you.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul\n\nOn 21/06/07, Paul Suckling  wrote:\n> Hello.\n>\n> Does anyone out there know if there is a function (or functions) that\n> will enable me to calculate prediction and confidence intervals from a\n> non-linear least squares model?
