Edgar Allan Poe introduced mystery fiction's \n      first fictional detective, Auguste C. Dupin, in his 1841 story, \u201cThe \n      Murders in the Rue Morgue.\u201d \n\nLast Updated at 4:50 PM\u2026 May 11, 2007 \n\nSATURDAY ON 48 HOURS \n      MYSTERY 9PM/8C Here's a preview from Erin Moriarty \n      about Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, DEATH OF A \n      DREAM: \"I have never quite believed the \n      theory that \"anyone\" is capable of committing murder. With most killers, \n      you usually detect a problem in their childhood or a personality defect \n      that causes that person to choose to take the ultimate action against \n      another human being. But what would lead a young man with no history of \n      violence to do something so out of character? It is just one of the \n      mysteries that surrounds the murder of 21-year-old Catherine Woods. \n      First, some background: Catherine Woods was a stunning and \n      talented young woman, from my hometown of Columbus, Ohio, who moved to New \n      York with hopes of becoming a dancer and singer on Broadway. As the \n      daughter of the well-known director of the Ohio State University Marching \n      Band, Catherine was used to the spotlight and dreamed of her own name in \n      lights along the Great White Way. But, three years later, on November \n      27th, 2005, she was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Initially, \n      police focused on two suspects, neither of which fits the profile of a \n      killer. They are both young, aspiring musicians with no criminal records. \n      Catherine's murder was exceptionally brutal which makes it all the more \n      difficult to believe that either man could have done it and yet, one was \n      arrested, charged and tried for her murder. In this week's program \n      Death of a Dream, we investigate the evidence and follow the trial \n      that ends with a dramatic and surprising verdict. It is a case that will \n      remind you, as so many of our cases do, how a single, senseless act in a \n      moment of passion, can have drastic consequences for so many.\" - \n      Erin Moriarty 48 Hours Mystery airs Saturday at \n      10pmET/9CT) If you would like more information on any of these \n      stories or the broadcast, please click on the following address and e-mail \n      us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS \n      EVENING NEWS Here's an early look \n      at what we are working on for tonight's broadcast of the CBS EVENING NEWS \n      from Early Show Anchor, Harry Smith, in for Anchor and Managing Editor \n      Katie Couric who is on assignment...
