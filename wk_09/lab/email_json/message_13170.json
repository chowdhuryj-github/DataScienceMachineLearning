It returned a warning telling me that it did regression and\nif that was really what I wanted.\nDoes anybody know what is being in terms of the algorithm when it does a\nregression? (the random forest is used as a regression, how does that work?)\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nRuben\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
