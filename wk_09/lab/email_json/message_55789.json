Complaining is\nanother. And telling other people what they should do to solve your problems\nis yet another thing entirely.\n\nBut anyway, my main point was to suggest that people ask themselves what\nthey've contributed to the open source community. Even if you're not a\ncoder, you can write documentation, maintain a web site, etc.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
