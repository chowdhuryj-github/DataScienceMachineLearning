No coding errors, real outliers.\n\nWhen plotting these data with a scatterplot, I obviously have a problem.\nIf I plot the full dataset with ylim = c(0,55), then I cannot see the\nstructure in the data in the [0, 10] range.  If I truncate the y axis\nwith ylim = c(0,10), then I cannot see the 3 outliers.  If I break the y\naxis from 10 to 20 (using plotrix functions), I still do not see the\ndata optimally because of the white space from y=20 to y=55.\n\nWhat I would like to do is break the y axis at 2 points, roughly 10-20\nand 20-55. Is there a function that can break an axis in 2 places?\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\nBrant\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
