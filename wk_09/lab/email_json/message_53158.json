You may need to create some dummy optimizations to\nboost test coverage.  Note the comment in POD:  \"Should this be part of\nconfig/inter/progs.pm?\"\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
