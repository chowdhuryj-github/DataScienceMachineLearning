A DAISY book (see \nhttp://daisy.org) is an XML file containing book structure, and maybe \naudio and maybe full text (and sometimes both).  DAISY books would be an \nexcellent way to deliver content, with either human or very high quality \nsynthetic speech.  A DAISY book reader that had the full text could \nhighlight words as they are spoken in audio, aiding reading \ncomprehension.  By the way, NIMAS is a derivative of DAISY, and is the \nemerging digital textbook standard.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter Korn\nAccessibility Architect,\nSun Microsystems, Inc.\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
