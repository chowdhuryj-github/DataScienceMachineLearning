I have started helping for the first time \na site that I run software for my router off of.  It is called www.xwrt.org \nthey make a web interface for Wrt project which can be found at \nhttp://www.openwrt.org.  But working for instance with a wiki is a bit of a \ntrick.  That seems to be about how 90% (percent) of the open source docs are \nkept.  Now as for speakup, I do not use Speakup I do all admin chores \nremotely through a Windows computer which works fine for me.  So as for \nSpeakup I don't use it but like to keep current on it.   I don't know how to \nprogram in Linux at all.  I don't expect Kirk to do everything either but it \nis very good to voice.  That might just be how the Speakup gets changed at \nsome point.  I myself would like to see Speakup in the kernel and user space \nwe would have the best of both world.\n\nTTFN,\n\nScott\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"John Heim\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Tuesday, June 26, 2007 1:17 PM\nSubject: Re: Software speech opinions\n\n\n>\n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Albert E.
