Did you mean to ask why \nna.rm=FALSE is the default?  I think it follows from thinking of NA as \nmeaning \"not known\", rather than \"missing at random\".  If you don't know \nwhy values are missing, you may get biased results by calculating the \nmean of the others:  and R would rather not give you biased results.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
