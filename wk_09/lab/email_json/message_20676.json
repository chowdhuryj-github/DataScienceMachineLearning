I'm not sure what you're trying to say.\n\nDo you want this?\n\n    /^(lmn|lpt|lor|mps|npr|nqt|opq|rst)$/\n\nAlternatively, can you say more clearly what you would like to match\nand what you would like not to match?\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
