At the device level, as interpreted over \nthe serial connection to the chipset, commands are embedded in \nthe text stream, identified by a CTRL-A or ASCII character 01.\nThis indicates a command will follow, and they are:\n\nT - Text Mode - Places the synth in text operating mode as \nopposed to character mode, reading words insteads of letters\n\nnT - Text Mode Delay - adds a pause between words. A zero\nvalue for n is normal speech, other values cause longer pause.\nThe value of n can be 0 to 15.\n\nC - Character Mode - Places the synth is character operating \nmode instead of text mode, reading letters one at a time rather\nthan whole words\n\nnC - Character Mode Delay - adds a pause between letters.\nA zero value is normal speech, other values cause longer pause.\nThe value of n can be 0 to 15.\n\nD - Phoneme Mode - Disables the text-to-phonetics translator\nallowing direct access to phonemes. Allows you to specify \nwords in phonemes, example computer is k ax m p yy uw dx er\n\nnS - Speed - Sets the speech speed. Default value of n is 5, \nrange of speed is 0 to 13.\n\nnO - Voice - Selects a preset voice. There are eleven preset \nvoices, default voice is 0, range of n is 0 to 10.\n\nnA - Articulation - Changes the voice from slurred 0 to choppy 9.\nDefault value of n is 5, range from 0 to 9.\n\nnE - Expression - Intonation or variation in pitch within phrase.\nValue of 0 for n is no intonation, range from 0 to 9.\n\nM - Monotone - Disables intonation\n\nnF - Formant Frequency - Adjust overall frequency response \nover the range of 0 to 99, default value 50.\n\nnP - Pitch - Adjust pitch over range of 0 to 99, default value 50.\n\nnT - Tone - Adjust tone over range 0 to 2, where 0 is bass \nsetting, 1 is normal, and 2 is treble\n\nnR - Add reverberation, where 0 is no reverb, range 0 to 9.\n\nnV - Volume range 0 to 9 default 5.\n\nThere are additional commands for punctuation filtering, exception\ndictionary, recording and playback of audio thru ADC (if functon\navailable on your chipset, and a few other control commands. \nDetails are in the chipset datasheet, these are for RC8660.\n\nAgain, this is device level commands, what is available is driver\nlevel may differ. An API (application programming interface) \ncan be made such that CTL-A 5V (set volume to level 5) can\nbe coded as setVolume(5) or any other syntax as the coder\nmay desire, or these commands can be inserted into any ASCII\nstream by using the CTRL-A (ASCII 0) to insert a command.\n\nIn the case of software like speakup, since it supports many \ndifferent synths, it has its own commands, which at the driver\nlevel in speakup translate to the native commands of the synth.\nThe above are the native commands of RC8660 doubletalk\nchip. It is quite a lot of fun to play with these commands and \nits possible to make many different voices.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Gaijin\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Thursday, June 14, 2007 2:08 PM\nSubject: Re: Hello...\n\n\n> ace wrote:\n> > if your budget allows, you should probably purchase a DoubleTalk LT \n> \n>      Now I just heard something about the DoubleTalk...something about\n> it having some kind of command language.
