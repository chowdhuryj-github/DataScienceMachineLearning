I started having problems with losing my erection after a few minutes. When I told my doctor, he asked if I wanted to try Cialis. I said sure. He wrote the script for 50mg and advised trying splitting them in half. I took a 25mg dose and was amazed. I got very hard and lasted a good half hour before my orgasm. We rested 10 minutes or so and then was erect again. Works the same every time now. Even 6 to 8 hrs later I find myself getting a hard erection.\nRoy Alexander.\nY0u can find it here \n\n\n"}
