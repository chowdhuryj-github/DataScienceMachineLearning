[On Washington D. C.]\nWhat you don't know takes a lot of explaining to the children.\nThe sole art that suits me is that which, rising from unrest, tends toward serenity.\nProsperity is not without many fears and distastes adversity not without many comforts and hopes.\nMan, being reasonable, must get drunk the best of life is but intoxication.\nContraries are cured by contraries.\nA lot of good arguments are spoiled by some fool who knows what he is talking about.\nGood things, when short, are twice as good.\nMost bosses know instinctively that their power depends more on employee's compliance than on threats or sanctions.\nThe days are too short even for love how can there be enough time for quarreling?\nWithout tradition, art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd.
