The recommended packages are installed in a library in\nthat directory whereas additional packages I install in a directory\nunder the /home directory as a user.\n\nUpdating the additional packages is very easy with update.packages()\nas a non-root user, but the recommended packages cannot be done so\nreadily because of file permissions.\n\nMy question is how do I set the permissions or ownerships in the\n/usr/local/R-2.5.0 directory so that everything necessary can be\nwritable by a user?  Should I make a group for R users (total of one\nmember) or is it simpler than that?\n\nTIA\n\n-- \n~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.   \n   ___    Patrick Connolly   \n {~._.~}          \t\t Great minds discuss ideas    \n _( Y )_  \t  \t        Middle minds discuss events \n(:_~*~_:) \t       \t\t Small minds discuss people  \n (_)-(_)  \t                           .....
