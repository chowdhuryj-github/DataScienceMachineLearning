Combine that with all of the fruits and veggies going \ninto the composter, and our bag count at the curb has been cut in half.\n\n> I reuse plastic grocery bags as garbage pail liners.\n\nWe use those for cat litter.

Also, we \ndidn't fix the A/C in the car when it broke down. For the three or four \nweeks a year it was being used, it's simply not a necessity.\n\n> I figure we're doing our bit. \n\nDefinitely.\n\n"}
