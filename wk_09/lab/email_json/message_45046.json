If we \nwait for one minute the logon works ok.\nWe did a series of packet captures and found out that during that time \nsome kind of initialization with the domain is done (which normally is \ndone when computer boots). We'd like to know if it is possible to \nreproduce this behaviour using the windows API, in order not to have to \nwait for a minute after each logon. Can anyone give us a tip on where to \nlook?\n\nThanks in advance,\nCarolina Bruzzoni\n\n"}
