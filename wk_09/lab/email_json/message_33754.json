When I plot the second function with \n\"lines\" in the plot, it is drawn beginning at 1 and that is wrong \nbecause it should start at 2. Is there a parameter where you can define \nthe start on the x-axis?\nThanks for help\n\nMarkus\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
