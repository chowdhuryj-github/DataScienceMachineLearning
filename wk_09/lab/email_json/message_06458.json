If you're just using ssh\nfrom the window side, it's not that much of an issue - since you can\njust play mp3s and such on windows.\nJust my $0.02,\nTyler\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (FreeBSD)\n\niD8DBQFGIv0aTsjaYASMWKQRAlKPAKCipLaMsamqAVNZS+fao/teB9jAXwCgqMUO\nQohLoGyCVLohffWcKd5ePpo=\n=fqyb\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
