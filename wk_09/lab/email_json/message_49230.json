So yes, I agree, the current command line tools are\nsuper powerful but not easy to use, and much work needs to\nbe done there. Basically we need something other than bash\nas the shell, with different ideas as to how command line \nshould be interpreted, managed, and configured, and then\nbetter applications to run in such an environment.\n\nI hope to work towards this some day, but I am starting\non a lower level trying to tackle how to get linux into the \npocket so its not chained to your desk. \n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
