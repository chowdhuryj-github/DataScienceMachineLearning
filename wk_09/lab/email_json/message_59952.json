I thought Speakup could\nalready paste between consoles, or was that changed?  I haven't tried\nSpeakUp's paste feature yet.  What is it exactly that you're trying to\ndo?  Do you actually want to *cut* from the screen, rather than copy\nfrom it?  If that's the case, you're talking about crossing from\nkernalspace to userspace.  Kirk would have to make SpeakUp ...Hmmm.\nMaybe erase with backspacing...No.  That would only work if the cursor\nposition matched the cutting  cursor position.  You're dealing with two\ndifferent cursor positions.  The twain may never meet without some\nextensive programming and/or software recognition.  vi's controls are\ndifferent from emacs, for instance.  Cutting would have to be performed\nthrough differing interface controls.  Backspacing *might* work, if\ncursor tracking was employed.  Some programs won't let you backspace to\nthe previous line.  Complexity increases when you're using a remote \nconsole..  You have to be able to control the position of the userspace \ncursor, independant of keymaps, terminals, and individual program \ncontrols.  I think it would work if there was a consistant method for \nrepositioning the userspace cursor, but I doubt that there is.  I hope \nthat's what you're talking about, anyway.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
