Regarding input devices, could a \nuser space speakup be controlled from a external numeric keypad plugged \ninto a usb port?  This would depend on whether we could identify the key \npresses as coming from the external keypad.  brltty has a stable \napproach for gethering console output.  So one of the missing pieces is \na way to control speech output.  If key presses on an external keypad \ncould be routed to speakup and not available to other applications, we \nmight have a relatively simple solution.\n\nChris\nChris\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
