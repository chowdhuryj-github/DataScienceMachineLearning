Having managed to get \ndroplinegnome installed, I ran gdm since startx wouldn't work and got \nlogged in.  I rn a gnome-terminal session and ran orca -t and tried \nconfiguring things.  I learned that speech was not available nor for that \nmatter was anything else except braille and braille monitor.  So having \nfound that out this is the latest offering by droplinegnome I could either \nget the missing pieces from gnome.org and try to run a hybrid system or \nremove all of it from the hard drive.  I chose to remove it all from the \nhard drive thinking that would involve less trouble.  Wrong!  After a \nsuccessful uninstall, I couldn't use ssh anymore on the system. \nreinstalling the ssh package had no effect.  I had to do a complete system \nreinstall to fix that problem. Something else with slackware, making an \ninstall without alot of the graphical stuff is risky.  I couldn't create \n/etc/lilo.conf using the system install and got an initrd system created \nfor me in the /boot directory.  Slackware didn't even tell me it was doing \nthat either. Another thing with slackware is that on some of the mnus \nwhere it appears next to impossible to position the cursor; hitting home \nkey followed by space will change the colors of the first entry in the \ntable then you can move up and down with the cursor and need to hit the \nspacebar to check items.  This works well when selecting startup services \nbut doesn't work when selecting time zones and does work well when \nselecting a modem link.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
