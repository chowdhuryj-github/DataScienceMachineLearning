(Kern, have you tried contacting them?)\n\nSo the question really is: how can we have Bacula in Debian, with SSL\nsupport, but without that clause?  And why does FSFE disagree with our\ninterpretation?\n\n-- John\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
