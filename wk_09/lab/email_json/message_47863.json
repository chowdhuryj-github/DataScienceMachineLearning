Referencing the dataset solved the\nproblem. I had actually tried it before but since I was also subsetting the\ndatset within the function (something I didn't mention in my question) the\nobjects were not of the same length and that caused me trouble. Your comment\nmade me realize that.\n\nThanks Hadley for pointing me out to ggplot2, looks like a very complete\ngraphics package and if it simplifies the programming it must be extremely\nuseful. I'll make sure to take a closer look at it.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDiego\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
