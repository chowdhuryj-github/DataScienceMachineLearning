I'd \nexpect it to be\n\n  read_config ('../config/legacyload.cfg', \\%ConfigFile);\n\nto pass a reference to the hash. Though it's hard to be sure since we \ndo not know what module defined the read_config() function. It might \nbe using prototypes to allow you to call it like you did, but it \nlooks unlikely to me.\n\nHTH, Jenda\n===== Jenda@Krynicky.cz === http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz =====\nWhen it comes to wine, women and song, wizards are allowed \nto get drunk and croon as much as they like.\n\t-- Terry Pratchett in Sourcery\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
