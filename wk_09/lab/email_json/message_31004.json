There\nis still a lack of transparency concerning policy priorities included\nin each objective as well as confusion between targets and indicators\nfor each objective.  Also some important mandates of WHO are not\nsufficiently reflected in the expected results, particularly in the are\nof access to medicines, where the ongoing work of the Intergovernmental\nWorking Group as well as the mandate of WHO to assist countries in\nusing TRIPS flexibilities when necessary are not reflected in any of\nthe expected results.  The organisation's role in monitoring the\neffects of trade agreements in the health sector and devising\nstrategies of needs-driven health research should be pointed out more\nclearly.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
