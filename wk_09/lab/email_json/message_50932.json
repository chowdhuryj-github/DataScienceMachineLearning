This \nwill include creating a library to allow developers to access the \nlicenses on a particular system.  After this is created I'll create \nfront-ends to this system through various systems starting with gnome.  \nThe biggest issue I'd like feedback on is what a license file should \nlook like.  I'd like to store the uri, name, description, status and \nlegal text within each license file.  I've post more info about this \nproject on the Creative Commons TechBlog at \nhttp://techblog.creativecommons.org/2007/06/19/system-integrated-licensing/ \n.\nThanks,\nScott\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
