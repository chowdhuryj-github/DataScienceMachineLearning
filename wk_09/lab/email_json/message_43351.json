The current\nmkproto.sh in Samba has led to bad programming habits and\nmonolithic code.  I doubt either one of us would disagree\non that.  Perhaps SAMBA_4_0 has the right model\nbut I will have to convince myself of that for myself\n(as I mentioned to Simo).\n\nwrt to findstatic.pl, I don't really see what this has to\ndo with autogenerated vs. hand written headers.  That tool\nis useful regardless.  Headers are designed to export\nan API.  That is why there are public and private headers.\nI'm mainly only concerned with the public headers (between\nsystems or modules).\n\nBut you've already drawn one more email out of me that I\nintended to contribute.  Very tricksy you are *Gollum*\n*Gollum*  :-)\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGZirQIR7qMdg1EfYRAiQKAJ4z2hTLZfWz4cZvHeoZKBdz9XYgpACfd//5\n6VzcUbIT7Rm1gp13a1UJbDM=\n=aqfn\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
