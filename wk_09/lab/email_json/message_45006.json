By all\ntests, S-plus appears acceptable, do not know about R.\n\nHowever, If your statistical method is an intricate part of a test, then\nyou do have to validate the system.\nThis is becoming increasingly relevant for theragnostics.\n\n..

Note that more errors are made in \nthe data preparation / derived variables stage than are made by \nstatistical software.\n\nFrank\n\n> \n> As I assume that you do not work in a regulated environment, you\n> probably wouldn't have access to a validated SAS environment anyways.\nIt\n> is not usually enough to install a piece of software, you have to\n> validate every step of the installation.
