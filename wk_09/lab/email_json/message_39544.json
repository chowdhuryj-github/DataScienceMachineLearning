So please understand that I\nwant do this without real need.\nThe error messages came from dpkg saying that libspeech cannot be\ninstalled due to dependency problems - too old libc6.\nNote: I can't predict if this is all, since dpkg tends to present erro\nmessages step by step. That means, if you solved one dependency issue,\nit can come up with another one etc. I experienced this sometimes.\nI hope that the information points the Ubuntu people to the right\ndirection. In the meantime we should recommend Ubuntu users to install\nthe source file of SD.\nHermann\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
