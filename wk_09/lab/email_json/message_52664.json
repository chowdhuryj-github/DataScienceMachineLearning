When I try the following:\n\nlibrary(R.oo)\nsetConstructorS3( \"QREobject\", abstract=TRUE,\n  function(...)  {\n    extend( Object(), \"QREobject\" );\n  }\n);\n\nI get:\n\n\tError in names(args) : no applicable method for \"names\"\n\nThings were working fine in R 2.4.1  \nI wonder if it has to do with this release note for R 2.5.0:\n\n    o\tlevels<-(), names() and names<-() now dispatch internally for\n\tefficiency and so no longer have S3 default methods.\n\nfrom here:\n\n\thttps://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2007/000828.html\n\nI'm wondering if I have done something wrong or is there an incompatibility issue.\n\nIf it's the latter, I hope Mr. Henrik Bengtsson would be nice enough to update the software.\nI'm so dependent on R.oo that I will roll back to 2.4.1 until there's a workaround for this.\n\nAnyone else having similar issues?  Thanks in advance.\n\n- Ken\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
