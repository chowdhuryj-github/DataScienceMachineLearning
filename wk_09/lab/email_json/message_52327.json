I warn you that \nWindow-Eyes will be of no help whatsoever in reading the Qemu console \nwindow.  In fact, I suggest either creating a custom set file for it and \nusing the Hotkeys option in the general menu to turn them off, or just \nunloading WE entirely.  That, of course, isn't very convenient.  If you turn \noff hotkeys in qemu alone you'll get response when alt+tab is pressed to get \nyou out of that window.  Anyway, here's what I do:\nTo start with, I haven't installed Qemu into c:\\program files.  I just did \nC:\\qemu,, with the bios in the same place.  So to get that option I do -L ., \nwhich like under Unix stands for current directory.\nA sample command line is:\nqemu -serial com3 -boot d -net tap,ifname=\"tap\" -net \nnic,model=rtl8139 -soundhw ens1370 -hda debian.img -cdrom debian.iso -L .\nThis is what I used to get Debian installed, with the Dectalk express \nconnected to a USB-to-serial converter which acted as COM3 under Windows. \nIt will work as ttyS0 under Linux, of course.\nThe boot d option is just to specify booting from the ISO image.  I \npersonally haven't done much with floppy images or actual drives.\nOnce Qemu runs, you'll possibly get a Windows properties dialogue asking \nabout whichever COM port you used.  Just hit enter to close it and you'll be \nin a Qemu console window.  Type the command to get speakup up and running, \nin the case of a Debian install it would be:\nspeakup speakup_synth=dectlk speakup_ser=0\n>From that point, assuming you unloaded WE or created a set file properly, \nthings will just run as normal.  You can alt+tab out of the Qemu window at \nany time.\nHope this helps some.\nThanks,\nZack.\nPS: If not, please feel free to ask me anything you'd like.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
