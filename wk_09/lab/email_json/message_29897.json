I have also written a small script that opens both\nfiles and reads the first 3 lines. That script completed successfully.\n\nAfter swapping lines 16 & 18 I see that the error has moved, but that (I think) also tells me that the xls file gets\nparsed and the xconf does not, so it may be that the xconf file is not in the proper format. But if swapping the lines\nmeans what I think then the issue is inside the xconf file and not in the code.\n\nDoes that logic work?\n\nTony\n\nP.S.
