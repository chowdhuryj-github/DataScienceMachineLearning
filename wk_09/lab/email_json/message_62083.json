Just choose to go to the configuring stage again.\n\nAlternatively, build etoys once using the -a build option:\n\n\tsugar-jhbuild buildone -a etoys\n\nThe reason is that Makefile.in changed recently but this change was  \nnot picked up automatically by the build system. I added a rule to  \nhopefully automate this in the future.\n\n- Bert -\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
