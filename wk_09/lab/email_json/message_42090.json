I'd like to give James the chance\nto experiment some.  Maybe we'll come to the conclusion that\nthe mechanisms used in the SAMBA_4_0 tree is appropriate,\nbut I would like come to that conclusion myself rather\nthan just accepting it on blind faith.\n\nJames, after some thinking perhaps it would be better\nto work on this in a bzr tree until it matures a little.\nHow would you feel about that?\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGZAPFIR7qMdg1EfYRAivSAJ9NJOcsQ6Iwr7zKT2xZf4A9CCVFTgCcCMcu\nWZYZurK3tWL6O0JJWLE/UvI=\n=KP/w\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
