Other Group B countries also have taken this position.\n\nTechnically, we are discussing the draft text on \"issues related to\nnorm-setting, flexibilities, public policy and the public domain,\" where\nthe controversial paragraph 3 now has the following brackets: 3. To\ndiscuss possible new initiatives and strengthen existing mechanisms\nwithin WIPO to facilitate [access to knowledge] and technology for\ndeveloping countries and LDCs and to foster creativity and innovation\nwithin WIPO's mandate.\n\nCanada said it \"didn't understand\" what \"access to knowledge\" meant. The\nUK indicated that there was a sentiment by many countries that while\nWIPO could discuss measures that would make access to knowledge hard,\nsuch as tough new digital copyright laws, it shouldn't discuss\nproposals, like a treaty to provide minimum access to works by\nlibraries, teachers and the blind, which would expand access.\n\nHere \"access to knowledge\" is referred to by many simply as A2K, a term\nthat is apparently terrorizing the many lobbyists for publishers. I'm\nhoping the U.S. will come around, and agree that yes, the U.N. can\nactually \"discuss possible new initiatives\" to facilitate \"access to\nknowledge.\" It is rather amazing that this is even controversial.\n\n--\nJudit Rius Sanjuan\nAttorney\njudit.rius@keionline.org\n\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nwww.keionline.org / www.cptech.org\n1621 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 500 Washington, DC 20009 USA\nTel.: +1.202.332.2670, Ext 18  Fax: +1.202.332.2673\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
