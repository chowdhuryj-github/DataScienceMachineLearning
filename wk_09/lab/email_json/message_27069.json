The\ntotal penalty to add to the objective is the sum of penalties\nover all constraints.\n\nThere is a catch or two when using this with derivative-based\noptimizers.  The objective typically becomes non-differentiable\nat the boundary, and optimizers can get confused.  They might\nbe less confused with smaller penalty rates.  However if the\npenalty rate is too small, then you can get a \"solution\" that breaks\none or more penalties.\n\nStarting from a solution given by Rgenoud or its ilk is probably\na good idea.\n\nPatrick Burns\npatrick@burns-stat.com\n+44 (0)20 8525 0696\nhttp://www.burns-stat.com\n(home of S Poetry and \"A Guide for the Unwilling S User\")\n\nPaul Smith wrote:\n\n>Dear All\n>\n>I am dealing at the moment with optimization problems with nonlinear\n>constraints.
