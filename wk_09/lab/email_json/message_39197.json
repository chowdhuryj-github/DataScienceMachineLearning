We no longer use the default settings for\nenc types from krb5.conf.  So I'm wondernig if the build linked\nagainst the wrong libs.    Can you send me a level 10 debug log\nand a raw packet trace illustrating the problem?\n\n\njerry\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXeqgIR7qMdg1EfYRAirBAJ4sw1F7x93R3a/QUb/S1eIqCYvBUQCeN1kr\nW9nWCaihut7akrOwcF33TmE=\n=vieL\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
