Additionally, there are observed exogenous variables that\naffect the latent endogenous variables, but these exogenous variables are\nalso specified to be uncorrelated. It's hard for me to imagine that you\nreally intended this, and even if the model is identified, I seriously doubt\nthat you can fit it to the data. Finally, you should verify that the input\ncovariance matrix is positive-definite.\n\nI think that the issues of model specification go well beyond how to use the\nsoftware, and I strongly suggest that you try to find someone local to talk\nto about your research.\n\nJohn\n\n--------------------------------\nJohn Fox\nDepartment of Sociology\nMcMaster University\nHamilton, Ontario\nCanada L8S 4M4\n905-525-9140x23604\nhttp://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox \n-------------------------------- \n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of \n> adschai@optonline.net\n> Sent: Sunday, April 15, 2007 2:16 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] Fit sem: problem of 'Error in \n> solve.default(C[ind, ind]) : Lapack routine dgesv: system is \n> exactly singular.'\n> \n> Hi - I would need help another time.
