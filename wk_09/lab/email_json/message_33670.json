Removing the intercept\nchanges the statistics from central to non-central moments.  The\nadjusted R2, by which I think you mean Fisher's adjusted R2, is based on\ncentral moments (ratio of unbiased estimators of variances---central\nmoments).  So if you remove the intercept, you must re-derive the\nadjusted R2 for non-central moments --- you can't just plug in the\nnumber of independent variables as zero.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of ???\nSent: Sunday, May 20, 2007 8:53 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] How to compare linear models with intercept and those\nwithoutintercept using minimizing adjs R^2 strategy\n\nDear R-list,\n\nI apologize for my many emails but I think I know how to desctribe my\nproblem differently and more clearly.\n\nMy question is how to compare linear models with intercept and those\nwithout intercept using maximizing adjusted R^2 strategy.\n\nNow I do it like the following:\n\n> library(leaps)\n> n=20\n> x=matrix(rnorm(n*3),ncol=3)\n> b=c(1,2,0)\n> intercept=1\n> y=x%*%b+rnorm(n,0,1)+intercept\n>\n> var.selection=leaps(cbind(rep(1,n),x),y,int=F,method=\"adjr2\")\n> ##### Choose the model with maximum adjr2 \n> var.selection$which[var.selection$adjr2==max(var.selection$adjr2),]\n    1     2     3     4\n TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nActually, I use the definition of R-square in which the model is without\na intercept term.\n\nIs what I am doing is correct?\n\nThanks for any suggestion or correction.\n-- \nJunjie Li,                  klijunjie@gmail.com\nUndergranduate in DEP of Tsinghua University,\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
