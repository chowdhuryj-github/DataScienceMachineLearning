As Thomas points out, if you want to\nactually use Q in a calculation, there will almost always be a\nmuch more efficient way of constructing the real goal of the\ncalculation.\n\nFor help in that construction, you can use the qr.Q and qr.R functions\nto see what Q and R look like.  This will help you confirm in tiny cases\nthat you have done the more efficient calculation correctly.\n\nRich\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
