The following assumes that 'keep' is a vectorwhich is TRUE for cases you keep, and FALSE for those ignored:\npc <- prcomp(x[keep,])predict(pc, newdata=x)\ncheers, Jari Oksanen\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
