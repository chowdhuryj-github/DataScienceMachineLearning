That meant deep emissions cuts by the developed world and helping less capable countries build their capacity to adapt to new weather conditions.\n\nThe industrial world must \"move significantly beyond the current institutional and financial arrangements,\" Ahmad said.\n\nIt is the first time government climate delegations are meeting since the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a series of reports this year drawing on the studies of some 2,500 scientists.\n\nThe reports warned that climate changes will hit poor countries hardest \u2014 less rain in arid areas like northern Africa and more severe floods in river deltas like Bangladesh.
