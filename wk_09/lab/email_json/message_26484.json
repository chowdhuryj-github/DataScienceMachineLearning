President\n  Bush toured the destruction in Greensburg\n  today. Hari Sreenivasan will have that story as well as more on the debate over\n  whether the National Guard is being stretched too thin in wartime to\n  adequately respond to disasters at home.\n\u00a0\nOn the West Coast, a wildfire is threatening Los Angeles landmarks,\n  including a famed park's conservatory and zoo. Sandra Hughes will have that\n  report. And Bianca Solorzano is on the other side of the country reporting on\n  the massive fires that are working their way through southern Georgia and northern Florida.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Vice President Dick Cheney is in Baghdad, on a surprise stop to urge Iraq's warring factions to find\n  more common ground. Mark Strassmann is there and will have our report.\n\u00a0\nWhat's the newest popular export from China?\n  Its language. American students are learning Mandarin in droves, and it's\n  becoming a popular subject in schools from Maryland\n  to Washington\n  state. Barry Petersen will report on the language\u2019s wide appeal in America.\n\u00a0\nFinally, we\u2019re going to introduce you to a\n  poet whose services reach an unusual market \u2013 the supermarket. Zach Houston hawks his\n  wares, commissioned poems, outside of grocery stores in Berkeley, California.\n  He may not be a Wordsworth, but what comes out of this wordsmith\u2019s\n  typewriter just might surprise you. John Blackstone will have the story.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
