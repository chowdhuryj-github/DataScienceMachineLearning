Do you have another ideas ?\n\nAnd after I need to extract maximum values for each group\nLike :\ngroup        max_value\n1            21\n2            24\n[...]\n\nand for each event which is part of a group to know if is't a ascending phase or no.\n\n\nYes, lot of questions !! Sorry, but I think that the solution may be unique.\n\nIn advance, thank you a lot\n\nregards\n\nJS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      _____________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
