Thanks\n> For your advice.\n\nI think, the kronecker product method (by Gabor) is a cleaner solution. \nSomething like:\n\nkronecker(matrix(1,1,Lagnum), diag(K)).\n\nMy experience with such constructions, in really large dimensions, is that: \nkronecker(...) is much faster than {r,c}binds and rep(...).\n\nRegards\nPK\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
