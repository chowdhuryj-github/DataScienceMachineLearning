As you know, boot.ci requires the use of boot to generate bootstrap replicates for my statistic. However this last function  doesn't work in my case because I am missing something. Here is an example\n   \n  y <- rnorm(100)\n  Quantile <- function(df)\n{\nquantile(df,  probs=c(0.05,0.95))\n  }\n  boot.out <- boot(y,Quantile, R=999, sim=\"ordinary\")\n   \n  Error in statistic(data, original, ...) : unused argument(s) (c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n   \n  I think  that it's due to another parameter (stype) that I have not  included but I don't know what this paremeter represents. \n   \n  Many thanks for any suggestion.\n   \n  Bernard\n   \n\n             \n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
