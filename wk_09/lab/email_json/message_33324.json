Its a one time thing (or two time) until the band begins to\nmake ends meet, but only if it is done by a firm/company, the whole\nstock market thing, doesnt appeal to me as much. The company can do all\nthe management work for the band, get concerts, design merchandise,\nsell stuff etc. Profit sharing being the underlying business model.\nLike Drew said, the fans are in any way paying thro CDs and downloads,\nconcerts, Ts etc. \n\nBY-SA allows remixing so that people can work over your music to create\ntheir own and still use it for commercial purposes. But for that they\nwill need a platform for distribution and if you are one, you should be\nhappy about it. So for me BY-SA is the best choice for digi music. \n\nA social networking site can connect the fans to artists and it\ncan do more than that. It can connect music enthusiasts with artists.\nIt can bring forth a community of music reviewers, people who will\nexplore music and in effect get more stuff for your venture. \nWell thats a thing I hope. \n\nCheers,\n\nUjjwal\n\n> >> > I've looked into several possibilities here in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0There's a number\nof> > projects which gain government funding for \"charitable work\", or\"community> > work\" which benefits others at reduced or no cost.\u00a0\u00a0We have a community> > studio locally for instance, I could record stuff there cheaply, or\n> > continue to do as I do now and record stuff in my own home setup.\u00a0\u00a0I'mnot> > sure if a band could run as a registered charity, though it's an> > interesting concept ;)>\n> That is an idea.
