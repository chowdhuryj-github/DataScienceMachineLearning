I'm sick of having to type a long name just to get a glimpse of something. For example, if my data frame is named 'AuroraStochasticRunsJune1.df\" and I want to see what the middle looks like, I have to type\n\nAuroraStochasticRunsJune1.df[ 400:500, ]\n\nAnd often I'm not even sure rows 400 to 500 are what I want to see.  I might have to type the same line many times.\n\nIs there sort of a R-equivalence of the Object Explorer, like in Splus, where I could mouse-click an object in a list and a window pops up?  Short of that, is there any trick of saving a couple of keystrokes here and there?\n\nThanks for tolerating this kind of annoying questions.\n\nH.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
