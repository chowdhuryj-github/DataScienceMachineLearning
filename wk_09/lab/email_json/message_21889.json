So what\u2019s next? While House Speaker Nancy \n      Pelosi has said Democrats will work with the White House to strike a deal, \n      but she\u2019s also said \u201cthere is a great distance between us right now.\u201d \n      Jim Axelrod will have the latest on the stalemate and David \n      Martin will report on the benchmarks that may be discussed for Iraq. \n      Yesterday\u2019s immigration rallies across the United States were \n      smaller than last year\u2019s, but more than just harsh words were exchanged at \n      some of the protests.
