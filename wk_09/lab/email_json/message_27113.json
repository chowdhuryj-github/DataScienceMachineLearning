That certificate is then used to digitally \"sign\" (apply \nidentifying code) to the product. The certifying authority is supposed to require \nidentification and do the necessary research to make sure the driver comes \nfrom a legitimate applicant.\n\nDrivers often need to operate at what is called the kernel level \u2014 \nthe very core of the operating system. The privileged nature of the kernel \nmeans that it needs special protection. Any compromise to the kernel can \npotentially bring down the entire system. Consequently, Microsoft is anxious to \nprotect the kernel, especially since \"rootkits\" \ncan use drivers and kernel-level software to hide from the operating system.\n\nThere's another reason Microsoft is anxious to secure this key part of \nVista, however. The company is promoting Digital Rights Management (DRM), which is \nused by copyright holders to restrict the use of content. Because \nMicrosoft wants Vista positioned as a platform that is safe for protected \ncontent, it needs its operating system to stop hacker code from \nintercepting media streams. Software could, for example, redirect music from \na PC's sound card and send it to the hard disk instead.\n\n\n\nHow driver signing works\n\n\n\nDigital signing seeks to make visible the source of kernel-mode software. \nIf the 64-bit version of Vista determines that a 64-bit driver doesn't have a signature \nfrom an accepted authority, the operating system will prevent it from loading.\n\nBut, of course, once a certificate is issued, it's somewhat out of the hands of the trusted \ncertificate authority. A vendor with a valid certificate could still produce \nbuggy or malicious code using the certificate, or sell it to someone else who could. \nMore likely, a stolen certificate could be published on the Web and used by \nhackers to produce their own brand of malware.\n\nIn theory, once such a compromise is discovered, Microsoft can revoke the \ncertificate (which, in the case of a hardware driver, would disable all products \nfrom the certificate holder). This could be done via a Windows Update \nthat tells Vista to block the signature in question.\n\n\n\nThe new world order of x64 Vista drivers\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has long encouraged the digital signing of software. Signed software \nis intended to let users know the source of a downloaded program. Users can then \npresumably decide whether it comes from a \"trusted\" source. Digital \nsigning also lets Microsoft identify the developer of a program that has crashed, \nassuming users choose to send Microsoft an error report when the \nfault occurs.\n\nWith Windows Vista, Microsoft has taken advances in code-signing technology \nfurther, making digital signing a requirement in some cases. Here are just a few \nof the new driver-signing requirements (or \"features,\" as Microsoft calls them) \nfor Vista:\n\n\n\nOnly administrators can install unsigned kernel-mode software.\n\n\nKernel-mode software must be digitally signed in order to run in the 64-bit \nversions of Vista. Even administrators can't load unsigned drivers in these \nversions.\n\n\nDriver software that loads at boot time must also have a digital \nsignature.\n\n\nSoftware involved in the streaming of protected content also requires a digital \nsignature.\n\n\nHardware drivers must have digital signatures to pass Microsoft's Windows Logo \nProgram.\n\n\n\nTo further complicate matters, \ndifferent (and, in some cases, multiple) kinds of signatures may be required for \ndifferent occasions. For example, in addition to Kernel-Mode Code Signing (KMCS), \ndevelopers who want the Microsoft Windows logo on their products may need to \nsubmit their products to Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) to \nreceive a WHQL digital signature.\n\n\n\nDigital signing does nothing to stop hackers\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, driver signing, as it is currently implemented by Microsoft, \nappears to be creating more obstacles for developers and customers than it is \nfor hackers. Even before the final beta of Vista was released, the Black Hat Briefings hacking \nconference demonstrated how easily the driver-signing security could be defeated, \nas described in an \neWeek article.\n\nVista's release candidates didn't fare much better. Researches at India's \nNV Labs \nwere able to devise a product called Vbootkit that bypasses driver-signing \nprotection in RC1 and RC2.\n\nFinally, experts at Symantec's Security Response \nAdvanced Threat Research group recently announced in a \n PDF report that they had succeeded in disabling the new restrictions on 64-bit Vista \nafter just one week of testing.\n\n\n\nHow digital signing burdens developers\n\n\n\nIf driver signing hasn't been an impediment to serious hackers, it has \nbeen a roadblock for legitimate developers of Vista drivers. Obtaining the necessary \ncertificate for digital signing reportedly costs US$500 \nper year (less if a developer signs a multi-year agreement). Once obtained, the \ncertificate has to be kept secure, since a stolen and published certificate could \nbe used by anyone to sign a driver.\n\nThen there are the technical hurdles, such as those needed to meet Microsoft's \nWHQL signing requirements. In a \n\nrecent analysis of Windows' content protection schemes, Peter Gutmann, \nresearcher at the University of Auckland's Department of Computer Science, writes, \n\"The vast majority of drivers running on PCs today aren't signed, not so much \nbecause the developers couldn't be bothered, but because the WHQL process that \nproduces the signed drivers is so slow that they're obsolete by the time they've \nbeen approved by Microsoft (and even some of the WHQL-certified ones are still \npretty flaky).\"\n\nEvidence of this situation isn't hard to find. Complaints about the lack of sound, \nmouse, and video drivers for Vista \u2014 months after its Jan. 30 consumer release \n\u2014 are rife, including an \n APC Magazine article by James Bannan. One angry user, consultant Dan Goldman, \nhas created a \n Web site advocating a class-action lawsuit against Nvidia and some of its partners \nfor video drivers that claimed to be \"Vista Ready Certified\" and \n\"Designed for Windows Vista.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Techarp Web site \nreports that ATI shipped its Radeon X1950 GT graphics card with a \"Windows Vista \nCertified\" label on the box, despite the fact that it contained no Vista driver \nat all. The release notes admit that fact, in apparent contradiction to the box \nlabel.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft can do better than this\n\n\n\nMicrosoft cannot expect widespread \nadoption of its new operating system if users cannot depend on the availability of \ndrivers to support the most popular hardware configurations. Nor will customers \nfeel safe with Vista when experts continue to report how easy it is to poke \nholes in Microsoft's new defenses. Users need to demand that Microsoft simply do \nits job better before releasing a new operating system, providing a stronger \ndefense against hackers without placing undue burdens on developers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

Note, \nhowever, that the Data Execution Prevention tab in SP2's Performance Options dialog box does not \nreport on your hardware's DEP capabilities, the way Vista's dialog box does.\n\nFortunately, other readers, including Stuartt Cuthill, point out that you can get this information \nby using a very simple freeware application, \nSecurable, from Gibson Research Corporation.\n\n\n\nDetecting DEP settings in XP\n\n\n\nA number of readers, including Jeff Kohut, pointed out that XP users can also detect whether DEP \nis enabled for a particular process by downloading the free Sysinternals utility \n\nProcess Explorer from Microsoft.\n\nProcess Explorer mimics most features of Task Manager and can be \nset up to display DEP status by choosing View, Select Columns. Check DEP Status \non the Process Image tab and click OK.\n\n\n\nWindows, not your browser, controls DEP\n\n\n\nOne reader, identified as \"Molotov,\" also uses Process Explorer and has a number \nof useful points about DEP:\n\n\n\n\" 'Hacker programs' are not the only kinds of programs that can utilize \nthe behavior DEP is designed to prevent. Indeed, the technique is so common \nthat Microsoft decided to change the default setting for DEP in XP SP2 from \nOPTOUT (Enable DEP for all executables, except those specified) to OPTIN \n(Enable DEP for core Windows system images) because in service pack testing, so \nmany programs were affected by DEP.\n\n\"The discussion of browsers and their ability to ignore the DEP settings \nwas interesting to me, as I am running XP SP2 (DEP setting of OPTOUT), and both \nIE 7 and Firefox run with DEP enabled (On, as reported by Process Explorer for \nfirefox.exe and iexplore.exe) on my system.\n\n\"This makes me question the statement, 'XP users apparently have no way to \nactivate DEP for IE 7.' IE 7 (as well as IE 6) respect the operating system's \nDEP setting. Though I did not try other browsers in these VPC images, I suspect \nthe results would be the same as my findings for IE 6/IE 7 and my experience on \nmy 'real' system. Add-ons for the browsers could certainly have an impact on \nthe experience one has with the DEP setting enabled for the browser process, \nwhich may lead one to add the process to the DEP exclusion list.\n\n\"The statement, 'IE 7 is not the only program that ignores Windows global \nDEP settings. Even with DEP turned on globally, Task Manager shows that neither \nMozilla Firefox nor Opera support DEP,' is misleading, in the sense that what \nTask Manager (or Process Explorer) is really showing is that DEP is or is not \n'enabled' or 'turned on' for the particular process, not that the process does \nor doesn't support DEP.\"\n\n\nAs Molotov points out, it's the hardware and Windows operating system that \ncontrols DEP, not individual applications. It now appears that XP \ndoes enable DEP for browsers when you choose Turn on \nDEP for all programs and services except those I select.\n\nHowever, this is not the case in Vista, which may be \nexcluding browsers for compatibility's sake, despite the user's DEP setting. It \nremains the case that in Vista, IE7 is the only browser that can have DEP \nenabled. This requires a setting change in the Internet Properties Control \nPanel, as described in the May 3 article.\n\n\n\nEven more discount programs for MS software\n\n\n\nDavid Hightower points out a great way for home \nusers to get Microsoft software at a terrific discount, if they work for the \nright employer:\n\n\n\"Lots of companies have 'home use' agreements with Microsoft, \nincluding military, \ncivilian employees, and contractors working for the U.S. government. \nParticipation in the Home Use Program (HUP) lets you obtain a licensed copy of \nMicrosoft Office and selected additional desktop applications (such as Front \nPage, Project, and Visio) to install and use on your home computer for a \nnominal cost. To participate, go to the  HUP Web site and follow the instructions.\n\n\"In addition to HUP, Microsoft also offers the Employee Purchase Program \n(EPP), which is available to government personnel (military, \ncivilian employees, and contractors). The EPP lets participants purchase some \nof Microsoft's most popular consumer software and hardware at discounted prices \n(Office, Windows XP/Vista, Money, etc.). To participate, go to the \nEPP Web site \nand follow the instructions.\"\n\n\nMicrosoft's Home Use program does offer amazing discounts for those \nwho qualify. To do so, however, you'll have to work for an organization that \nis signed up with Microsoft's Software Assurance volume-licensing program. The \nprogram is designed to let employees work at home using the same software they \ndo at work.\n\nConsequently, the software available to you depends on what software your \norganization has licensed. One reader who uses this program, Evan Orensky, \nwrote to say that he got a copy of MS Office 2007 Enterprise for just a \nfulfillment fee, which in his case was US$20, plus tax. \"The license is \nvalid for as long \nas you work for the company, and as long as the company maintains its Software \nAssurance coverage,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nOEM discounts can apply to end users\n\n\n\nSome readers thought an interpretation of OEM software licensing \nterms that we printed in the \nMay 3 \nnewsletter was too restrictive. Michael Sullivan writes:\n\n\n\"Your article suggests that only 'authorized dealers' can sell Microsoft \nWindows OEM software. I don't think this is accurate. The OEM license, which \nyou [Susan Bradley] post on your site, and which is also available at \nMicrosoft's site, makes clear that the license only applies if a \n'system builder' accepts the license agreement by opening the package.  If the \npackage is unopened, the agreement is inapplicable and the owner may \n'transfer' (i.e., sell) the package intact to another 'system builder.'\n\n\"Are Amazon or Newegg system builders? I don't think so. Are they \nselling OEM packages? Yes. Are they bound by any shrink-wrap licensing \nrestrictions on packages they don't open? No way. \n\n\"You are correct in stating that a person opening the package must become \na 'system builder' by registering with the Microsoft Partner Program, at least \nto the extent the shrink-wrap license is legally binding, which is by no means \nclear. This requirement is not stated in the agreement itself, but is \nincorporated into it through the back door by insisting that the license is \nonly valid if the OS is preinstalled using certain tools that, it turns out, \nare only available if one registers as a system builder.\n\n\"In any event, one doesn't have to be a system builder on the scale of \nMichael Dell to qualify. If a computer builder, who can be an individual, \nregisters and uses the tools provided, he or she can legally buy the OEM \nsoftware from anyone (such as Amazon or Newegg) \u2014 not just Microsoft's \nhalf-dozen authorized distributors \u2014 and preinstall it with the \ndesignated tools on computers for his or her \ncustomers.\"\n\n\nA similar point is made by another reader, Sean Toner, who writes to point out \nthat the \nOEM license agreement \nactually defines a system builder more broadly than \none might assume. It states that a system builder is \"an original \nequipment manufacturer, an assembler, refurbisher, or pre-installer of software \non computer systems.\"\n\nStill another reader, Poul Andeersen, cites a Microsoft posting on the\n Small Business Community Blog stating that \"OEM system \nbuilder software packs ... are not intended for distribution to end users. \nUnless the end user is actually assembling his/her own PC, in which case, \nthat end user is considered a system builder \nas well.\" [emphasis added]\n\nSuch a statement suggests that hobbyists who are assembling or \nrefurbishing a system may legitimately buy OEM system builder products.\n\n\n\nMore deals for Australian students\n\n\n\nFinally, Lyn Hancock writes in with another way \nfor Australian students to get software through an academic \ndiscount.\n\n\n\"The most surprising deal that I have seen for university students is from \nMicrosoft itself! Check out Microsoft's \n\nUnistudentoffer site as well as their \nIt's Not Cheating \nsite. The offer of a perpetual license for Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 is \nunbelievable!\n\n\"Basically, if you have a valid Australian university e-mail address, \nyou can purchase either a 12-month license for this bundle for \nAU$25 (about US$21) or a perpetual license \nfor AU$75 (US$62). The only catch is that the offer is valid for only three \nmonths, which ends on May 28.\"\n\n\nThanks for the tip, Lyn!\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.
