See:\n\nhttp://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2007-06/msg00013.html\n\nBefore anybody submits a bug report against base-files: Is there an\nofficial statement from Debian about the DFSG-free status of GPLv3?\n\nI would like to put it in common-licenses as soon as it is useful to\ndo so, but policy says:\n\n   Packages distributed under the UCB BSD license, the Artistic license,\n   the GNU GPL, and the GNU LGPL, should refer to the corresponding files\n   under /usr/share/common-licenses,[82] rather than quoting them in the\n   copyright file.\n\nAm I right to think that policy refers to version 2 of the GPL, as such\nparagraph was written before GPLv3?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
