It has been conducting negotiations since\n2006 with\nMerck over the price of the drug.\n\nEfavirenz is an important drug as it is estimated that 75,000 or 38% of\nthe 200,000\npatients having antiretroviral treatment in Brazil will be using it by\nthe end of this\nyear.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health (MOH), despite the increasing\nnumber of\npatients taking the drug, the prices for Efavirenz have not altered\nmuch since 2003.\n\nEfavirenz (in tablets of 600 mg) is currently available in Brazil at\napproximately\n$580 per patient per year. This is 136% higher than the price offered\nby the same\ncompany in Thailand, where about 17,000 people are taking the drug.\n\nThe MOH says that it has received proposals for the supply of Efavirenz\n(600mg)\nby generic drug companies at far cheaper prices than the price that\nMerck has been\ncharging in Brazil.\n\nGeneric versions of the drug that have been pre-qualified by the World\nHealth\nOrganisation have been offered to Brazil at between $163.22 and $166.36\nper\npatient per year, or at a cost of $0.4472 to $0.4558 per tablet.\n\nAccording to the MOH, buying the drug at these lower prices would reduce\nexpenditure on Efavirenz by around $30 million per annum on the 2007\ncontract,\nwith estimated savings by 2012 (when the patent expires), of $236.9\nmillion.\n\nIssuing a compulsory license is a measure allowed by the WTO's TRIPS\nAgreement to overcome the patent barrier and enable the supply of\ncheaper generic\nmedicines either through import or local manufacture.\n\nWhere a compulsory licence is issued for \"public non-commercial use\",\nas appears\nto be the intention of Brazil, there is no requirement to engage in\nprior negotiations\nwith the patent holder.\n\nHowever, the MOH has said that since 2006, it has been in constant\nnegotiation\nwith MSD to reduce its price, but with no success.\n\nThe Ordinance states that \"the Ministry of Health undertook, without\nsuccess, all\nefforts to reach an agreement with the manufacturer of Efavirenz\nregarding the\nprices charged in Brazil, with reasonable terms and conditions to meet\nthe public\ninterest.\"\n\nThe MOH was offered a 2% reduction in price (for the 2007 supply\ncontract) by\nMSD, which it considered insufficient.\n\nThe MOH said that it instead requested that MSD charge prices\ncompatible with\nthe growing use of Efavirenz in Brazil and with the prices that are\nbeing charged\ninternationally. It indicated that it would accept the same price\noffered to Thailand,\nnamely, Efavirenz 600mg for $20.21 per bottle of 30 tablets, being the\nequivalent\nof approximately $246 per patient per year.\n\nWith regard to the oral solution version of the drug, the MOH said that\nit would\nhave accepted the prices charged in First World countries, namely,\n$16.92 per\n180ml bottle of 30mg/ml oral suspension.\n\nHowever, according to the MOH statement, \"the company was relentless\nwith\nregard to the price. Therefore, the discussion came to an end without a\nsatisfactory\nagreement.\"\n\nThe MOH also mentioned that MSD sets its differential pricing, i.e.\nbetween\n$277.40 and $697.00 per patient per year based on the countries' Human\nDevelopment Index and/or HIV prevalence, but in calculating the price,\nother\nrelevant aspects were totally disregarded, such as the extent of the\npopulation's\naccess to treatment, the absolute number of patients who take the drug\nor even if it\nis used for initial treatment, as is the case in Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilian move can be expected to spark a new round of negotiations\nwith\nMSD. Pharmaceutical companies are known to be more responsive to a\ngovernment request for significant reduction in drug prices where there\nis an\nimminent issuance of a compulsory licence, or following the issuance of\na\ncompulsory licence.\n\nMSD offered to the Thai government Efavirenz at $0.72 per tablet of 600\nmg (650\nbaht per bottle), however with several conditions, after Thailand\nrecently issued a\ncompulsory licence for the import and local manufacture of Efavirenz.\n\nThe generic Efavirenz imported from the Indian company Ranbaxy at less\nthan\nhalf the original price of the patented product meant that the Thai\nMinistry of\nHealth will be able to provide Efavirenz to 20,000 additional AIDS\npatients.\n\nMSD also went on to publicly announce a reduction in the price of its\nHIV/AIDS\nmedicine STOCRIN (efavirenz), to $237.25 per patient per year (from\n$0.76 to\n$0.65 per day)  for purchasers in countries in the low category of the\nHuman\nDevelopment Index (HDI) and in medium HDI countries with an adult HIV\nprevalence of 1% or greater.\n\nIn medium HDI countries with an adult HIV prevalence of less than 1%,\nit offered\na price of $1.80 per day, or $657.00 per patient per year, reduced from\n$1.91 per\nday for the same formulation.\n\nMalaysia issued a compulsory license in November 2003 to import generic\nDidanosine, Zidovudine and Combivir for HIV/AIDS treatment from India.\nFollowing this, the patent holders Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Bristol\nMyers\nSquibb reduced its price for the patented products by more than 50%.\n\nThe Brazilian government has also gone through a similar experience. In\n2005, it\nmade a declaration that the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination (marketed\nby the\nbrand name Kaletra) was of public interest and on numerous occasions\nindicated\nthat it would issue a compulsory licence.\n\nThis threat of a compulsory licence eventually led to an agreement with\nthe patent\nholder Abbott for a reduction in the price. The government did not\nissue a\ncompulsory license.\n\nBrazilian NGOs are strongly supporting the government move. The Working\nGroup on Intellectual Property (GTPI) of the Brazilian Network for the\nIntegration\nof Peoples (REBRIP) said that it believed that the government would not\nbe once\nagain a \"Tiger without Teeth\".\n\nInstead, it expects that the government will this time \"follow through\nwith its\ndecision to guarantee access to an essential medicine by initially\nimporting cheaper\ngeneric versions and later by producing the drugs locally.\"\n\nThe GTPI/REBRIP said that a technical study that it carried out in\n2006, as well as\nother studies by the UN Development Programme and the Clinton\nFoundation,\nshowed that Brazil had adequate national drug production capacity.\n\nIt added that the issuance of a compulsory licence constitutes a\nhistorical decision\nand contributes to the sustainability of the State policy guaranteeing\nuniversal\naccess to medicines, demonstrating also the maturity of Brazilian\ninstitutions that\nused to vacillate when facing international pressure.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
