I'd like to block all potential udp threats as well as any other ports running that I don't know about that iptables is showing. Anyone have any suggestions?\nThanks,\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
