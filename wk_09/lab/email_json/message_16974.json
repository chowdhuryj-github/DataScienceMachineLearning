You can do all you want with the copy, but it won't change the\noriginal hash.\n\nOne solution would be to add a line like this at the end of your sub:\n\n    %$hRef = %dHash;   # copy the data back to the real hash\n\nBut that's not the best solution, for a number of reasons. (For one\nthing, if you return early from the subroutine, you'll need to add\nanother line like that.) Instead, I'd fix your sub to work with the\nreference, using $hRef wherever you used dHash.\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
