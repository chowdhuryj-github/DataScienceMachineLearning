I had some free time last year, so I threw it together for her. She wanted some shots of food (obviously) and I suggested we go with Creative Commons licensed images on Flickr. After some digging around, we found some great ones licensed under Attribution only.\u00a0 And of course we were both happy not to have to use (or pay for) stock images.\u00a0 Anyway, I figured this list might find it an interesting example of a real world application of cc-licensed images.\nBest,Fred\n"}
