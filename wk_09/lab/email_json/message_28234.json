A contented mind confers it on all.\n\nMan shall not live by bread alone.\n\nWhat counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog.\n\nA bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.\n\nAt least the box is full of something useful. [On his photo gracing a box of Raisin Bran]\n\nThe best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.\n\nIt doesn't do any good to sit up and take notice if you keep on sitting.\n\nA sedentary life is the real sin against the Holy Spirit. Only those thoughts that come by walking have any value.\n\nDeceive not thy physician, confessor, nor lawyer.\n\nThe present is the only reality and the only certainty.\n\nInstinct is action taken in pursuance of a purpose, but without conscious perception of what the purpose is.\n\n\n"}
