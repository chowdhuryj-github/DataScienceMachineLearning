We've got all archs and all formats for etch.\n\nThey're available through http and ftp at ftp.br.debian.org/debian-cd,\nand through rsync at ftp.br.debian.org::debian-cd.\n\nPlease update the mirror lists. I was going to use the submission form\nbut we don't know yet who (if?) we'll get a push from, and I'm afraid\nof using the modification option, only fill in the CD fields and have\nthe others erased :-)\n\nAll iso images were generated with jigdo. It produces the ~400GB set\nwith only about 2GB of downloads. Nice job...\n\nOn another issue, that dns change for mx and cl didn't happen yet. The\nnew release would be a good time for it.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-mirrors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
