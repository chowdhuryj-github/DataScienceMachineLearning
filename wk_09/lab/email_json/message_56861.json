However, I just noticed this near the \ntop of the Slackware change log for Slackware current.\n\nkernels/speakup.s/:  Backed up speakup to CVS 2007-03-03 and recompiled.\n   I'm hoping this fixes a DecTalk Express problem.\n   Thanks to Stephen C. Greeley for all the help debugging this.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
