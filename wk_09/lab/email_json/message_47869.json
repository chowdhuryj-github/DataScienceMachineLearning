They are receiving a full stream of telemetry and have been able to restore power to critical systems.\n\nThe navigation system and command computers feature three redundant data paths and only one path, or lane, has been re-established. Troubleshooting continues, but engineers have restored station power to systems in the Zvezda and Zarya modules. The crew's Soyuz lifeboat, which was put on internal power late Wednesday as a precaution, also was switched back to station power.\n\nDetails were sketchy, but a NASA official said commanding to the one restored computer lane had been restored and the Russians could, if necessary, use it to adjust the space station's orientation by firing Russian rocket thrusters.\n\nAttitude control is critical to keeping the lab's solar arrays properly oriented and to preventing sensitive systems from getting too hot or too cold. The guidance computer system must be operational before the shuttle Atlantis departs next week.\n\nDuring the station's next pass over Russian ground stations later this morning, commands will be uplinked in a bid to restart lanes two and three. It is not yet clear whether the Russians have tracked down the root cause of the problem or whether it could happen again.\n\nRussian engineers speculated Wednesday that the failures may have been related to the installation of a new U .S. solar array Monday. Early today, they isolated the Russian segment from U.S. power while they worked to restart the computers. U.S. power later was restored with no apparent problem.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
