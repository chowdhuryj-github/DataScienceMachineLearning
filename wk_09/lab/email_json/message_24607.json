I just get ready for the next play, the next game, the next season.\n\nBecause you are a great lord, you believe yourself to be a great genius. You took the trouble to be born, but no more.\n\nPeople who want the most approval get the least and people who need approval the least get the most.\n\nThe great question is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with failure.\n\nThe heart is half a prophet.\n\nFew people can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation, or creed.\n\nThe brave and bold persist even against fortune the timid and cowardly rush to despair though fear alone.\n\nNothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.\n\nWho so loves believes the impossible.\n\nBe absolutely determined to enjoy what you do.\n\nI wasn't driven into medicine by a social conscience but by rampant curiosity.\n\nLife is largely a matter of expectation.\n\nIt is better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.\n\n\n"}
