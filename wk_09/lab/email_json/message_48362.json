Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nPanel data is about several subjects being tracked over time, so gives a \nseries of related time series.  It also known as 'longitudinal data' or \n'repeated measures' (perhaps with slightly different emphases).\n\nIf the observation times were the same for all subjects a vector AR \n(presumably the one of several senses of 'VAR' being used) could be used, \nbut conventional analyses are via mixed/GEE models (and in simple cases \nthese reduce to a nested anova).\n\nThere are examples in MASS and in Diggle, Hegarty, Liang and Zeger (cited \nthere).\n\n\n> ----- Original Message ----\n> From: \"Leeds, Mark (IED)\" \n> To: Megh Dal \n> Sent: Wednesday, June 13, 2007 8:30:18 PM\n> Subject: RE: [R] Panel data\n>\n>\n> not as far as I know.
