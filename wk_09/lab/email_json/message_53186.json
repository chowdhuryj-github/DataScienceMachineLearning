You will have to determine a way to test a user\nresponse to a prompt. Note the comment in POD:  \"This is a separate\nunit from config/inter/progs.pm because the answers depend on which\ncompiler is in use.  Thus it should come after the gccversion test.\"\nThis may affect how the tests in this file are set up.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
