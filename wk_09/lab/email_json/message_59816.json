The following pp command would probably have\nworked:\n\npp -o a.par -p -e \"use lib 'somewhere/where/the/module/live'; use\nDateGen; use JythonFeeder; use MetaMonConfigLoader; use\nMetaMonSshConn; use SetSQL; use SshConn;\"\n\nBest regards,\nSteffen\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
