I took a cursory look at the\nlicense, and I'm wondering if its even viable to upload to non-free.\n\nThe text of this license is available here:\n  http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/219741.htm\n\nIt seems pretty clear that the intent is to permit redistribution, but\nI'm unsure about some of the restrictions. I'd like to collect a list\nof issues with this license (if any) with respect to non-free and see\nif Intel is willing to change them. The one that sticks out to me is:\n\n * Section 4: \"Updates\" requires \"commerically reasonable efforts\" to\n   supply our \"customers\" with updates that Intel distributes. If this\n   means we cannot say no to an update from Intel, that does not sound\n   reasonable for non-free. But perhaps we are exempt from this since\n   1) non-free isn't officially part of Debian and 2) we are a\n   non-commercial entity making commercially feasibility null? \n\n-- \ndann frazier\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
