It's easy enough to calculate the PRESS\ncriterion for a fitted lm object, but I'm having trouble deciphering the\nstructure of the regsubsets objects that leaps works with.  Is there any way\nto calculate press from a regsubsets?  Or, to put it another way, can I get\nthe residual vector and the diagonal entries of the hat matrix from a\nregsubsets object?  In fact, if the hat matrix is never calculated\nexplicitly, the columns of Q from the QR factorization would suffice.\n\nThanks,\nAndrew Smith\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
