I've adopted Volker's proxy_xxx_call()\nmechanism to allow us to replace the hand marshalled server\ncalls one by one.  See rpc_server/srv_lsa.c for examples.\n\nSome on the conversion will be simple, boring grunt work.\nOthers will be a little more tricky. On Volker's suggestion,\nI would like to propose is that we replace the server and\nclients calls in Samba 3.0.26 one by one and removing the\nrelated marshalling code fro rpc_parse/ as we go.  The idea\nto to destabilize the tree as little as possible so thorough\ntesting of each RPC swapover is a requirement.  The cutoff\nfor RPC changes will probably be the 3.0.26pre1 release.\n\nSounds acceptable to everyone?\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXJIoIR7qMdg1EfYRAqGAAKCW9eiQ0MCth61AhobP6rFV44cyJQCgoqP8\nOEnUF4DWDbN35tw/l99snsg=\n=fYVj\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
