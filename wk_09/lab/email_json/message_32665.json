Get on\nGPSI first thing Monday!\n\nAfter our time on Salina, however, a lot else is not so familiar. My\ncousin is taking an extended trip to Bhutan next year. But then as\nEduardo, the son of the owner explains, hospitality runs in the family.\nWith the sound of a massive roman candle a sheet of bright red flame\nshoots up from one of four smouldering holes in the crater.\nHe has apparently forgotten the first rule of politics: you are what you\nare. Not a single person asked for a pen, or money, or photographs.\nI get up early, I go to sleep late, and I always work very hard. Like\nthe farmhouse, the truest experiences in Bhutan are unplanned. Oh, and\none last thing. \"A lot of the old hippy rhetoric could well be co-opted\nnow by the pseudo-libertarian right, which has in fact happened.\nAfter our time on Salina, however, a lot else is not so familiar. What I\ndo care about is the substance, the facts, the details.\nIn comparison with Salina, Panarea and Stromboli, it s main town feels\nsomething of a metropolis with its bustling port and winding\nVespa-clogged, washing-line-flagged alleyways.\nThese are difficult times, and they require seriousness and stability.\nCaptain told us that a journey is the Buddhist metaphor for life , and\nto show compassion to a traveller is to add to your own karmic merit. It\nis a country of such profound, deep-rooted faith, that it is impossible\nto journey through it without being affected.\nThe first flare of molten rock takes us all by surprise. Zombie Brown\ntalked encouragingly this week about openness and parliamentary\naccountability.\nThe island and surrounding islets are undeniably pretty, while its tight\nstrip of houses and hotels backed by hectares of bare rock lend it an\nintimate \"discovered\" feel. These are all, however, just curtain raisers\nfor the real performance of the volcano itself. Our welcome at Hotel La\nPiazza is the warmest we receive anywhere in the islands. He has\napparently forgotten the first rule of politics: you are what you are. I\nconsider the consequences, not just the spin.\nShould you manage to overcome these obstacles and board a Druk Air\nflight, it will probably be the most surreal aviation adventure of your\nlife. Outside, we were met by our guide Yeeshay, a young smiling man\nwhose job it was to shadow us till our departure a week later, and to\nensure that we were, at all times, having the time of our life.\nOur welcome at Hotel La Piazza is the warmest we receive anywhere in the\nislands. In search of rustic authenticityPhuntshocholing  farm house\nwasn't what I was expecting, not least because I'd booked an upmarket,\nmodern guesthouse .\nIt is in this hostile environment that Brown will be asking Britain to\ndeliver Labour one more chance to do the job. I'd be more than happy to\nreturn to any of the Aeolians, but should the same fate befall us on our\ndeparture as did Odysseus, then I'd hope it was Salina's port we were\nblown back to.\nThe smell of a private gentlemen's club, all beeswax and dusty velvet,\nhung over the debate, the outcome of which was about as far as it is\npossible to get from openness and accountability.\nIf it does become law, some of the benefits of the Freedom of\nInformation Act will continue.\nPanarea, while only a boat trip away, is very different from Salina.\nSalina is the most unpretentious of islands.\nMark Williams, international economist at Capital Economics, said that\ndespite a \"triple whammy\" of measures, little had changed.
