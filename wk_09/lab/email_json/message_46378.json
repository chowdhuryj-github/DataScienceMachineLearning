The goal of the excursion is to electrically connect a newly attached solar array truss segment to the station's power system and to remove a variety of launch locks and restraints so the huge blankets can be unfurled Tuesday.\n\nThis is the 84th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the seventh so far this year and the first of at least three EVAs by the Atlantis astronauts. It is the first spacewalk for Olivas and the third for Reilly.\n\n\"It's beautiful out here,\" Olivas marveled as he floated out of the Quest airlock module.\n\nReilly and Olivas began today's spacewalk an hour and six minutes late because of work needed to reset the space station's control moment gyroscopes earlier in the truss attachment sequence.\n\nHere is an estimated timeline of today's activities based on the actual start time of the EVA (in EDT and elapsed time; subject to change):\n\nEDT........HH...MM...EVENT\n\n04:02 PM...00...00...Spacesuits to battery power\n04:12 PM...00...10...Airlock egress\n04:27 PM...00...25...Reilly: Connect S1-S3 nadir electrical cables\n04:47 PM...00...45...Olivas: Release solar array blanket box restraints\n05:02 PM...01...00...Reilly: S3 computer shroud removal\n05:32 PM...01...30...Reilly: Connect S1-S3 zenith electrical cables\n06:02 PM...02...00...Reilly: Keel pin rotate\n06:32 PM...02...30...Reilly: Release solar panel gimbal assembly\n06:47 PM...02...45...Olivas: Release radiator locks\n07:12 PM...03...10...Reilly: Unstow forward solar array blanket box\n07:17 PM...03...15...Olivas: Unstow aft solar array blanket box\n07:32 PM...03...30...Reilly: Install rotary joint drive motor (1 of 2)\n07:37 PM...03...35...Olivas: Remove unneeded insulation blankets\n08:07 PM...04...05...Olivas: Rigidize internal truss braces\n08:32 PM...04...30...Reilly: Remove rotary joint launch locks\n08:47 PM...04...45...Olivas: Remove rotary joint launch locks\n09:47 PM...05...45...Cleanup and ingress\n10:27 PM...06...25...Airlock repressurization\n\nSee the 9:17 a.m. status report for a detailed spacewalk overview.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
