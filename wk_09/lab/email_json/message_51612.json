Bool::False).\n    my $foo = eval q[ 1 ?? Bool::True !! Bool::False ];\n    is($foo, Bool::True, \"a statement with both ??!! and :: in it did compile\"), :todo;\n}\n\n\nI'm not entirely certain what this test is intending to test.\nDo we need it?  Does it perhaps belong somewhere else?\n\nThanks,\n\nPm\n\n"}
