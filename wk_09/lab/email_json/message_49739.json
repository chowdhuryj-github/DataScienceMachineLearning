I'd love to point this out  \nto some of the more ardent drm supporters who frequent the darker  \nboards on digital rights these days.\nI already (as a matter of course) remove copy protection on books I  \nbuy, but it'd sure be nice to be able to sink some claws into a few  \nemails I send requesting non-drm versions of some books.  If it's   \nallowed for us to break  them anyway, it'd be easier for us all  \naround if they'd just give them to us drm free in the first place.   \nThis would go miles towards making that argument for me.\n\n\nOn Jun 17, 2007, at 1:49 AM, Jude DaShiell wrote:\n\n> Blind citizens of the United States of America in the United States of\n> America have been granted a D.M.C.A. exemption by the Librarian Of\n> Congress which permits us to use whatever encryption cracking  \n> software we\n> can use to crack the codes on D.M.C.A. protected e-books.
