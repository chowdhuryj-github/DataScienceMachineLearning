If you can, I goofed, and you can ignore\nthe rest of this message.\n\nI wasn't able to see the API documentation from with swat's\nDocumentation module.  Hunting around for what I might have broken, I\nnoticed that in the old qooxdoo-0.6.3-sdk/frontend/api/Makefile, the\ngenerator.py command says:\n\n --api-documentation-json-file source/script/data.js\n\nwhile the qooxdoo-0.6.5-sdk/frontend/application/apiviewer/Makefile says:\n\n --api-documentation-json-file $(APPLICATION_PATH)/build/script/apidata.js\n\nI.e., the name of the data file seems to have changed from \"data.js\"\nto \"apidata.js\".\n\nThe application files taken straight from qooxdoo-0.6.5 seem to\nreflect this name change. That is,\nqooxdoo-0.6.3-sdk/frontend/api/source/index.html used to say:\n\n        viewer.load(\"script/data.js\");\n\nwhile qooxdoo-0.6.5-sdk/frontend/application/apiviewer/source/class/apiviewer/Application.js\nnow says:\n\n        this.viewer.load(\"script/apidata.js\");\n\nBut the swat's version of these files seem to still use the old name.\nswat/source/class/swat/module/documentation/Documentation.js  says:\n\n  viewer.load(\"script/data.js\");\n\nI tried just replacing \"data.js\" with \"apidata.js\" in\nDocumentation.js, but that did not suffice to make the documentation\nvisible.  I needed to also run \"make api\" by hand in the webapps/swat/\ndirectory, then copy webapps/swat/api/script/apidata.js to the\n$DESTDIR/share/webapps/script, before the GUI documentation viewer\ncould show me anything.  I.e., it seems to me that the normal build\nand installation procedure does not install the GUI documentation (but\nI'm especially tentative in that observation, since I find myself\ngetting lost in qooxdoo's elaborate facilities for installing resource\nfiles).\n\n"}
