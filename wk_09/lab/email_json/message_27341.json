I should've probably explained what I was trying\nto do better (Just an LOCF!). As you've correctly pointed out I'm trying\nto merge two time series where the first series is daily (price data),\nand the second series is irregular (earnings, balance-sheet data). \n\nWhile using an LOCF would certainly solve my problem (In SAS, one used\nthe DOW (Dorfman-Whitlock) loop for this purpose, but I didn't know it\nexisted in R), to account for the possibility of a timestamp in the\nirregular times series _not_ having an equivalent in the regular series\n(wherein the na.locf would introduce an NA in the regular series), I\njust inner-join the regular series with the result.\n\n> x <- zoo(rnorm(11), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + c(1:6,8:10))\n\nRegular series: Doesn't have 7.\n\n> y <- zoo(rnorm(4), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + c(0, 3, 7, 10))\n\nIrregular series: Has 7.\n \n> z <- merge(x, y)\n\nFull join between x and y.\n\n> z1 <- na.locf(z)\n\nThe LOCF.

I assume that A and B are not the\nobservations but the corresponding time stamps, right?\n\nIn any case, I guess that the \"zoo\" package will have some useful\nfunctionality for what you want, e.g., if you have data like\n  library(\"zoo\")\n  set.seed(123)\n  x <- zoo(rnorm(11), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + 0:10)\n  y <- zoo(rnorm(4), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + c(0, 3, 7, 10)) then you\ncan merge them with\n  z <- merge(x, y)\nand then eliminate NAs, e.g. by\n  na.locf(z)\nor you could aggregate() the \"x\" series so that it becomes a monthly\nseries or something like that.\n\nSee\n  vignette(\"zoo\", package = \"zoo\")\nfor more information.\n\nBest,\nZ\n\n> For all A[i], i = 1,...,N and B[j], j=1,...M\n>\n> Match with B[j] where A[i] <= B[j]\n>\n> When A[i] > B[j], match with B[j+1] where A[i] <= B[j+1]\n>\n> Basically the less-frequent attributes stay true for a stock while the\n\n> daily prices change.\n>\n> One example of this is the vlookup function in Excel with the TRUE \n> option.\n>\n> So we have an implementation of this in R?\n>\n> TIA and best,\n> -Tir\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
