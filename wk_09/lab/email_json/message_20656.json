Function \"symbols\" (graphics) does produce a \n> smooth circle, but it cannot produce an arc.\n> \n> Please see the following example, drawing complete circles:\n> \n> plot(-5:5,-5:5,type='n')\n> ## draws circle with function symbols (package graphics) ## - \n> inner circle is very smooth:\n> symbols(0,0,circles=2,add=TRUE)\n> ## draws circle parametrically - outer circle is too coarse:\n> pi <- 4*atan(1)\n> t <- seq(0,2*pi,0.02)\n> lines(4*cos(t),4*sin(t))\n> \n> Package \"plotrix\" has a function \"draw.arc\", but arcs \n> produced with this function are also either too coarse or too \n> polygonal, depending on the number of polygons used to \n> approximate the arc.\n> \n> Is there a way to harness the characteristics of function \n> \"symbols\" (graphics) to draw a smooth arc, not just a complete circle?\n> \n> I am using R 2.5.0, running under Windows XP.\n> \n> Thank you very much.\n> \n> Paulo Barata\n> \n> -----------------------------------------------------------------\n> Paulo Barata\n> Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) Rua Leopoldo \n> Bulhoes 1480 - 8A 21041-210  Rio de Janeiro - RJ Brazil\n> E-mail: pbarata@infolink.com.br\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
