During his playing career he competed in five Ryder Cups and won four times on the European Tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS WEEKEND ON BBC SPORT\n\u00a0All the TV and radio times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOLF\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/golf\nFriday 1100-1300, BBCi; 1330-1800, BBC TWO Saturday 1300-1725, BBC ONE Sunday 1300-1730, BBC TWO\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOTBALL ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/football\nSaturday\nFootball Focus (1210, BBC ONE); Scottish Cup final: Celtic v Dunfermline (1300, BBC ONE Scotland; 1600 Radio Five Live/online).\nSunday\nLeague One play-off final commentary: Yeovil v Blackpool (1500, Radio Five Live/online).\nMonday Championship play-off final commentary: Derby v West Brom (1500, Radio Five Live/online).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE SPORT ON THE BBC\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/tvandradio\nFriday Test Cricket: England v West Indies (1045-1845, Radio Five Live Sports Extra, BBCi & BBC Sport website).
