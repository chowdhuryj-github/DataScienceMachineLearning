Seeing no replies to the enquiry about 3D\n\thistograms,  I thought I'd try to get Goodal's code running\n\tin R to see if it might solve guarav's problem.\n\n\tThe trouble is, all the guts of the procedure, *including*\n\tthe plotting are done from within Fortran.  The actual\n\tplotting seems to be done through a call to a subroutine\n\t``segmtz'' which is a piece of Splus software that does not\n\texist in R.\n\n\tIs there an equivalent subroutine in R that could be called?\n\tI dug around a bit but couldn't figure out what was going\n\ton.  The function segments() simply calls\n\t.Internal(segments(....\n\n\tI looked around a bit for corresponding C or Fortran code but\n\tobviously didn't know how to look properly.\n\n\tI think that the Fortran code could be translated into raw R\n\tand the call to segmtz changed to a call to segments() ---\n\tbut this would seem to be a lot of work.\n\n\tCan anyone suggest a reasonably simple way of replacing the\n\tcall to segmtz in the Fortran?\n\n                                        cheers,\n\n                                                Rolf Turner\n                                                rolf@math.unb.ca\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
