I talked to \nFoster about fighting the good fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad EULAs are anticompetitive\n\nFoster's chief gripe against EULAs is their anticompetitive nature.\n\n\"One of the most insidious clauses, and one that is always there, \nis the prohibition against reverse engineering,\" says Foster. \"Every software uses it.\" \n\n\nFoster cites the case of Blizzard v. BnetD, in which three programmers created an \nopen-source software product that allowed users to play Blizzard games on their \nown set of servers rather than on Blizzard's Battle.net \nservice. In this case, the court stood by the EULA and suppressed the BnetD \nsoftware, even though (as Foster \nreported), it does \nnot violate any copyright.\n\nThe problem is that \"the EULA doesn't define reverse \nengineering. It just stops you from studying the product to make a better one \u2014 \neven if you don't look at the code,\" says Foster. \"Just looking at what the software \ndoes can be considered reverse engineering.\"\n\n\n\n\nEULAs also censor consumer reviews\n\nOther EULAs attempt to censor users from \npublishing evaluations of the product. For example, a few years ago, Foster \ndocumented \na clause in the McAfee VirusScan license agreement that stated, \"The customer shall \nnot disclose the results of any benchmark test to any third party ... and will \nnot publish reviews of the product without prior consent from Network \nAssociates.\"\n\nFortunately, New York Attorney General Elliott Spitzer took McAfee \nto court and won.\n\nThat, however, has not stopped others (including Microsoft) from trying the same \nthing: The EULA for Vista Home Premium states that you have the right to conduct \nbenchmark testing and that \"you may disclose the results of any benchmark test \nof those components, provided that you comply with the conditions set forth at \n[Microsoft's  Web site].\" \n\n\nIn his column, Foster noted that \nalthough the terms are relatively reasonable, the EULA restriction itself is \ntied to a specific Web page that can be changed at any time. Moreover, he notes \nthat EULAs for other Microsoft products, like SQL Server or Visual C++, have been \nusing censorship clauses for years.\n\n\"Those clauses have never been enforced by the courts that I know of,\" Foster \ntold me. \"But they still have a chilling effect. Who wants to be the one to \nchallenge Microsoft?\"\n\n\n\n\nBad EULAs are anticonsumer\n\nEULAs aren't just bad for the software \nindustry. \"The basic EULA mentality makes it hard for the customer to know what \nthe real deal is,\" Foster says. \"What are the real terms of the deal? Do you \nhave a warranty? What kind? Are there any limitations on usage? Can you resell \nit?\" Consumers are expected to read thousands of words of legalese just to know \ntheir rights and limitations.\n\nAs an example of anticonsumer behavior, Foster recalls the EULAs in the case of \nGateway Computers, which was sued in 1995 for selling a computer with components \nthat were not as advertised. But as he noted in his\nMay 2005 \narticle, the arbitration \nclause of the license agreement required the parties to pay a nonrefundable \nUS$2,000 to involve an arbitration body in France \u2014 more than the original \nproduct was worth.\n\n\n\n\nEULAs attempt to legitimize spyware\n\n\n\n\"Probably the most outrageous example is the whole spyware phenomenon,\" Foster \nsays. \"If spyware had always simply been the criminals, the guys in Russia \npurveying software, it never would have become the problem it did.\"\n\nAccording to Foster, \nspyware became a problem because companies like Claria/Gator, WhenU, and \nDirectRevenue use EULAs to gain customer \"consent\" when installing pop-up adware.\n\nUnfortunately, most consumers aren't aware of the license or what its language \nmeans when they click their agreement to the license and installation.\n\nOne egregious example is the case of FriendGreetings.com, which required users to \ndownload and install a reader to see its electronic greeting cards. Customers \nhad to consent to two seemingly harmless license agreements, the second of which \nstated that the company would be using the customer's Outlook contact list to \nsend encouragements to download the software.\n\nAs if accessing your Outlook contact list wasn't enough, Foster reported in a \n\nNov. 1, 2002, article that the \nsoftware \"also apparently deposited several spyware/adware agents that needed to \nbe sought out and eradicated before they caused trouble.\"\n\nIn a  Dec. 2004 article on \nthis subject, Foster composed what he would consider an honest adware notice:\n\n\n\"Warning: This program will display innumerable pop-up ads over content you \nmight wish to see. It will watch what you do on the Internet and report that \ninformation to people of questionable motives. It might automatically download \nadditional software from other parties that will also display ads and/or collect \ninformation about you. Installing this program will thus inevitably degrade the \nperformance of your computer until it's a useless piece of garbage. Do you \nagree, bozo?\"\n\n\n\n\nAre EULAs even necessary?\n\n\n\nFoster has never understood the need for a \nlicense agreement. \"Copyright law applies to software whether you have a EULA or \nnot,\" he points out. \"You don't need a EULA to keep people from infringing on \nyour copyright. The documents are trying to make us all become lawyers in order \nto buy software. At the same time, it's not really doing \nanything to protect the basic copyright on the software, which would be there \nregardless.\"\n\nHis contention is supported by \nCircular 61 from the U.S. Copyright Office, which states that \"copyright protection \nextends to all the copyrightable expression embodied in the computer program.\" Naturally, \nsome aspects of software (like ideas and logic) cannot be copyrighted, but that holds \ntrue for books and all other copyrightable products as well.\n\nFoster has written more on this topic on his \n Gripe Line site.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can be done?\n\n\n\nLucky for us, Foster has not sat around waiting for others to improve the \nsituation. He belongs to Americans for Fair Electronic Commerce Transactions \n(AFECT), which is associated with the \nFairTerms Web site, and has joined \nforces with those trying to block industry-supported legislation like UCITA \n(Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act) that would give EULAs even more \npower.\n\nIn addition, he started a \nWiki site \nwith a EULA library, where users can post examples of good and bad EULAs. He \nhas also \n drafted a FEULA, or fair EULA, to serve as a model for \nsoftware developers.\n\nBut what should the rest of us do? I asked Foster what \nhe thought of EULA analyzing tools, such as the free \n  EULAlyzer from \n Javacool Software. \nEULAlyzer looks for keywords and attempts to alert the user to undesirable behavior \nor unexpected requirements in the license. \"Conceptually, I think it's certainly \na good idea,\" he said. But, he adds, it depends on what issues the analyzer \nis looking for.\n\nIn addition, \"if the EULAlyzer finds one way of phrasing it, they \n[software companies] will find another way to phrase it. They can make them as \nobscure as they want to, and they do.\"\n\nAnother way to avoid \nproblem agreements is to use open-source software, a practice Foster has \nadvocated in his column:\n\n\n\"Open-source equivalents for most major types of productivity applications are \navailable and mature enough to use; the rest are maturing quickly. Some are \nsurpassing their closed-source counterparts,\" he writes. \"I pretty much never \nbuy software any more myself, despite having a Windows box \u2014 where possible, I \nuse free software, with the only real exception being blockbuster games.\"\n\n\nConsumers need to be more vocal. \"I don't believe everyone should \nalways be forced to read the EULAs they encounter in daily life,\" Foster told \nme. \"We'd spend most of our lives reading obscure language. If you see a company \nthat's asking you to read 10,000 words of gobbledygook, tell them no, you don't \nwant to. As consumers, try to push back.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

But reader Sean Toner writes in with a correction:\n\n\n\n\"You are correct that a 1-pack Vista OEM package does not include the \nOPK.\n\n\"However, according to the OEM License, the requirement to use the OPK \napplies 'when \nyou distribute an individual software license for a desktop operating system.' \nBut presumably the requirement does not apply to an enthusiast who installs OEM \nVista on a single machine for his own use.\n\n\"Also, I understand that a 1-pack Vista OEM DVD will install itself \nquite easily without requiring the use of the OPK.\"\n\n\nWhat you say makes perfect sense, Sean! Thanks for pointing out this \nlanguage in the\n OEM license agreement. There seems to be little reason for the average \nhobbyist who is building his or her own system to join the Microsoft Partner \nProgram or download the OPK.\n\n\n\nRefurbishers are also 'system builders'\n\n\n\nConcerning the topic of who qualifies as a \"system builder\" \nand, therefore, for an OEM discount, Chris Miller writes:\n\n\n\n\"Good article on Microsoft's OEM licenses. I wonder how much of a system I would \nneed to build before I could qualify as a 'system builder.' I've never built a \nsystem from the ground up \u2014 motherboard, CPU, disk drive, etc. \u2014 because \nI don't consider this a profitable use of my time, but I've changed most of \nthese components at one point or another.\n\n\"If I wanted to upgrade my Windows XP system to Vista, I'd certainly need a new \nhard drive and graphics card (probably memory, too). Leaving aside the question \nof 'how would they ever know?', would such a change be sufficient to make me a \n'system builder'? Or do we need a court case to decide?\"\n\n\nThe OEM license agreement defines a \"system builder\" as \"an assembler, \nrefurbisher, or pre-installer of software on computer systems.\" The license does \nnot define \"refurbisher,\" but another Microsoft document (in Acrobat PDF format) \nfrom the Microsoft Partner Program site, the\nChannel \nDiscussion Guide, states that \"Refurbished PCs are those PCs where the \ncomponents have been changed or upgraded\" (page 2).\n\nCertainly, that would include \nchanging any of the components you listed. See the item below for more \ndetails.\n\n\n\nRepairing a broken PC doesn't invalidate OEM license\n\n\n\nReader Brett Sheaffer is concerned that he might have discovered another \nrestriction on OEM software:\n\n\n\n\"I just called a Microsoft representative last week to ask the pros and cons \n(straight from the horse\u2019s mouth!) of OEM vs. retail versions of Windows. I \nwas considering signing up for their Partner Program (as a 'system builder') in \norder to save money by using the OEM versions.\n\n\"One of the limitations I was made aware of (that so far has turned me off to \nOEM versions) is that once the OEM software is installed, a new license or disk \nmust be purchased if any one of these components fail and need to \nbe replaced: motherboard, hard drive, or processor.\n\n\"For large system builders who turn a good \nprofit and can buy OEM disks in quantity while providing warranty support to end \nusers, that isn't so much an issue. But for small 'hobby' builders like me who \nbuild only a few per year, there is 'insurance' in buying the retail \nversion!\"\n\n\nBrett, I think you may have misunderstood what the representative told you (or \nthe rep simply got it wrong). To begin with, I can find no mention of this \nlimitation in the OEM license agreement.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft has addressed this issue in the\n\nChannel Discussion Guide (the full title being \"Discussion Guide: \nClarifying Proper Windows Desktop OS Licensing\"). Page 2 clearly states \nthat \"If the motherboard is being replaced because of a defect, a \nnew OS license is not required.\" [Emphasis added.] \nThe only time a new OS license is required is when \nhardware refurbishing is done for reasons other than a defect (for example, \nadding memory or getting a faster motherboard).\n\n\n\nZoneAlarm is still not Vista ready\n\n\n\nRegarding the security products we listed in the \n\nMay 24 issue, a number of \nreaders echoed the concern expressed by reader Alan Horton:\n\n\n\n\"I am surprised that you still have the ZoneAlarm Security Suite in your \nSecurity Baseline, as it does not yet support Vista.\"\n\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that many ZoneAlarm products, including the ZoneAlarm \nInternet Security Suite, are not yet available in a Vista-compatible version. \nHowever, the company promises free Vista updates as soon they do become \navailable. The ZoneAlarm\n Web site states, \"ZoneAlarm products are eligible for a free Vista \nupgrade when it is released as part of a 1-year update program.\" But \nthat's a small consolation for those who've been waiting for an update \nfor several months.\n\nFor those who want a Vista-capable security solution now, the runner-up we\nmentioned in the article, Norton Internet Security 2007, supports Windows Vista \nas of February 2007, according to the product\n FAQ.\n\nIn the paid version of today's newsletter, you'll find more solutions to \nsubscription subterfuge, the topic of our\nMay 17 story \non companies that automatically sign you up for credit-card renewals. \nYou'll also find a new way to save big on Microsoft \nsoftware via the Microsoft Partner Program.\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.

The methods we describe\nwork with Windows, Apple, and Linux and don't require any filters or block\nlists \u2014 but you can use those in addition to the book's techniques,\nif you wish. \n\nMore\u00a0info\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nContents\u00a0 \nIndex\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\nThe following topics appear in the free version\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\u00a0\u00a0\nReaders win a Housecall from Fred Langa\n\n\u00a0\nMany applied, four were chosen\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nTOP\u00a0STORY\u00a0\u00a0\nA crusade against bad EULAs\n\n\u00a0\nBad EULAs are anticompetitive\n\n\u00a0\nEULAs also censor consumer reviews\n\n\u00a0\nBad EULAs are anticonsumer\n\n\u00a0\nEULAs attempt to legitimize spyware\n\n\u00a0\nAre EULAs even necessary?\n\n\u00a0\nWhat can be done?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nKNOWN\u00a0ISSUES\u00a0\u00a0\nGet OEM discounts when you upgrade your PC\n\n\u00a0\nOEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) not always required\n\n\u00a0\nRefurbishers are also 'system builders'\n\n\u00a0\nRepairing broken PC doesn't invalidate OEM license\n\n\u00a0\nZoneAlarm is still not Vista ready\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nWACKY\u00a0WEB\u00a0WEEK\u00a0\u00a0\nSee the end of the world in 90 seconds\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get all of the following in the paid version\n\n\nWOODY'S\u00a0WINDOWS\u00a0\u00a0\nVista time-saver #7 \u2014 resize pictures quickly\n\n\u00a0\nWhere are the PowerToys for Vista?\n\n\u00a0\nVista's biggest missing feature\n\n\u00a0\nAlternatives to the Image Resizer PowerToy\n\n\u00a0\nVSO Image Resizer fills the bill\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPERIMETER\u00a0SCAN\u00a0\u00a0\nFirefox is becoming a more important target\n\n\u00a0\nA bug fix for Firefox 2.0.0.4\n\n\u00a0\nNew Firefox exploits uncovered\n\n\u00a0\nIs there any reason to dump Firefox?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nKNOWN\u00a0ISSUES\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\nMore ways to get Microsoft products discounted\n\n\u00a0\nTips on getting discount software subscriptions\n\n\u00a0\nProblems with McAfee auto-renew cancellation\n\n\u00a0\nMore tips on virtual credit-card numbers\n\n\u00a0\nUse virtual credit-card numbers in the U.K., too\n\n\u00a0\nAVG paid version lacks forced auto-renewal\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPaid subscribers can access all old and new paid newsletter content\nMake a contribution to support our research into Windows and you'll immediately\nbe able to read and search through scores of valuable articles.
