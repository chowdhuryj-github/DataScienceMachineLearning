This is how we used to (and are supposed to)\nwork.\nJeremy.\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/locking/brlock.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/locking/locking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/blocking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/reply.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/trans2.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/locking/brlock.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/locking/locking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/smbd/blocking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/smbd/reply.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/smbd/trans2.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/locking/brlock.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/locking/locking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/smbd/blocking.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/smbd/reply.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/smbd/trans2.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (867 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23014\n\n"}
