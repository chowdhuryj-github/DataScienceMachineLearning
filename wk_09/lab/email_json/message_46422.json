If I use the following commands, I don't have the possibility to \nswitch the \"y\" values from Observed for the scatterplot to Predicted for \nthe line.\n\nxyplot(Observed ~ Time | Drug, data = mydata, panel  =  function(x,y, ...){\n+            panel.xyplot(x,y,...)\n+            panel.xyplot(x,y,type=\"l\",...)})\n\nI wonder if this problem can be solved using the trellis.focus \"family\" \ncommands but I have a hard time to understand how they work.\n\nPlease, let me know if a thread have already addressed this question. \nOtherwise, I would grateful for any hint, comments or info you can provide.\n\nThanks\n\nSebastien\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
