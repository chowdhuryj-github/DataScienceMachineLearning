I \nhave read in my data using read.table, and my 'time' column is recognised \nas a numeric variable. When I convert this to a time format, I am no longer \nable to use its values on my x-axis. The problem is that I only want part \nof the time series to appear on the plot, ignoring the first 23 \nmeasurements.\n\nI would be very grateful if someone could suggest a way of solving this.\n\nThanks,\nPatrick\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
