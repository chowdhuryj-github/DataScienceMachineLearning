In lecture at Yahoo's YUI\nTheatre one of JS's gurus talked about how it is organized in\nJavaScript parser.\n\nIf the line of code is not ended with ';' the parser tries first\nto assume that the next line continues current one. If then syntax error\noccurs, the parser _goes_back_ and make another asumption that previous\nline was ended with semicolumn.\n\nProbably there are much more than one way to implement ';'-less but it\neither slows down the compiler or makes grammar more complex.\n\nAnd in fact Perl 6 already allows not to type ';' at the end of\n{block} ;-)\n\nThe following simple snippets work correctly with Pugs and perl5:\n\n#### perl 6\nsub debug ($value)\n{\n    say $value\n}\ndebug 'me'\n\n\n##### perl 5\nsub debug\n{\n   print shift\n}\ndebug 'me'\n\n\nAnd finally, Perl is not an Assembler with one only instrucion per\nline.\n\n\n--\nAndrew Shitov\n______________________________________________________________________\nandy@shitov.ru | http://www.shitov.ru\n\n"}
