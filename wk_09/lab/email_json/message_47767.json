The application has a field which contains a customer name.  This\nvalues is supposed to be set by the person handling the work but sometimes\ndoesn't get done.  This leaves a NULL value in the database which, in turn,\nleaves me with a null key in my hash.\n\nI've tried resetting it by assigning the value to another key so I can delete\nthe element but so far nothing has worked.  I've tried to access it with\n$hash{}, $hash{\"\"}, and $hash{''}.  None of these will allow me to access the data.\n\nI could probably reassign it through more complicated means but that would\nrequire creating objects and accessing methods I'm not familiar with.  If anyone\nknows an easier way to access a null key I'd appreciate hearing it.\n\nThanks\nMathew\n-- \nKeep up with me and what I'm up to: http://theillien.blogspot.com\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
