There are many people looking for\nlinux boxen to play with on the net. They look for\nknown vulnerabilities and old versions of networking\nsoftware that don't have the latest security patches.\nA canned router does not have ability to do things\nlike login, install rootkits, open rogue connections,\netc. Even if you don't open ports and follow all of\nthe best security practices, eventually you will\nforget something, or not have the latest patch, or\nmaybe you already have a rootkit installed and do\nnot know. Reason enough for me, and besides a\nrouter is just as cheap as a wireless adapter to\nmake a PC into router.\n\n\nace wrote:\nHow come people don't just use their Linux box as\nthe router and a wireless switch\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
