The first place I looked was in\nthe survival package since it can obviously handle \ncensored data.  However, I don't have any particular desire\nto restrict myself to standard survival models just because\nI have some censoring.  Frailties appear to fit in nicely\nwith the types of models typically used with survival data,\nbut that's not the only kind of model I'd like to look at.\n\nThanks,\nSpie\n\n\nOn Mon, 23 Apr 2007, Pikounis, Bill [CNTUS] wrote:\n\n> Spie,\n> In perhaps similar situations where there are clusters of measurements\n> due to repeated time or space on an individual subject or experimental\n> unit, I have used the survreg() function from the survival library.\n>\n> You can specify left, right, and/or interval censoring within a data set\n> through Surv(), and so I have used left censoring for the LOD\n> observations.
