Whether the mail software you use has the capability;\n2. Whether the digest format would permit it anyway.\n\nRegarding (2), if you are receiving R-help in \"traditional\"\ndigest format (all the messages, each with its principal\nheaders, as one single long message-body), then the only\nway to respond to a particular message is to start to\ncompose a new message and copy what you need from the digest.\n\nWhile I've never reveived R-help in digest format myself,\naccording to Martin Maechler:\n\nhttp://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/59429.html\n\n  Please open the URL at the end of every message\n     https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n  go to the bottom and \"log in\" -- clicking the\n  [Unsubscribe or Edit Options] field.
