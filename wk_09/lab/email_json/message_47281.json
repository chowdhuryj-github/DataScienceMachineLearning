As a Minitab user prior to\ndiscovering R,  I was\nable to view the PRESS statistic and the resultant cross validation R^2.\nIs there a canned\nfunction already present that does this or should I go ahead and just\nright a user defined\nfunction?  \n\nAlong the same lines, is there an easy way to extract the Sum of Squares\ncolumn from an ANOVA\nanalysis in order to compute the total sum of squares?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nMatt Pietrzykowski\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
