Then I run\nupdate.packages() to update the additional packages I have\ninstalled. Of course, I may get bit by this approach one day.\n\nIt is possible to have more than one directory for packages.\nOne suggestion I've seen is to collect your \"user installed\"\npackages in a different directory than the base and recommended\npackages.\n\n-- \nKevin E.
