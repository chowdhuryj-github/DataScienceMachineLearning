I want to make a barplot of some data.  My\ndata is of a score that is separated by year and by a limit (above 3 and\nbelow 3 to calculate the score).\nYear\tLimit\tHSS\n1999\tALT\t0.675\n1999\tVFR\t0.521\t\n2000\tALT\t0.264\n2000\tVFR\t0.295\n\nI would like to have a barplot with year on the x axis and HSS on the y\naxis and the two limits as two different colors to show the difference.\nUsing (dataset$HSS, col=c(\"green\",\"purple\"))  I  get some of the plot\nbut I don't know how to get labels on the bottom for each year and I\ncan't get a legend for my barplot.  Not really sure what I am doing\nwrong but any help would be much appreciated.  \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
