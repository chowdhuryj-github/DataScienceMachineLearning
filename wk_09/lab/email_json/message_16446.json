It's really annoying when it\ndoes happen, but it's not enough of a problem to outweigh Darcs's benefits.\nThere is a Google Summer of Code project which will hopefully fix this[0].\n\nRecently, we've run into this problem while developing features for OLPC in\nGabble (the Telepathy XMPP component). We've worked around this by\nre-committing patches. A new branch containing all OLPC-related\nfeatures and fixes can be found at [1]; sugar-jhbuild has been updated to use\nthis branch.\n\nAs this branch has a different name, JHBuild should check it out into a\nseparate directory rather than updating the existing checkout; hence the bug\nwill not be triggered. If you do find that darcs has hung, the workaround is\nto remove the checkout.\n\nWe're sorry for any inconvenience.\n\n[0] http://code.google.com/soc/haskell/appinfo.html?csaid=647C914C97658198\n\n-- \nDafydd\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
