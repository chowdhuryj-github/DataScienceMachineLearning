Does anyone know of a reference that\nexplains this?  The R documentation cites Li and Racine's book, but I\ncouldn't find any reference to kernel modal regression in it.\n\nI gather that this is the preferred function for a nonparametric\nregression with a discrete dependent variable.  Based on Li and Racine,\nI would have thought that a conditional conditional density estimation\n(i.e. npcdens) was the way to accomplish this.  I'd like to understand\nthe difference.\n\nthanks,\n\nb. wagman\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
