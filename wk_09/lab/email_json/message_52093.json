Believes that health care infrastructure deserves stable and long\nterm financial support from national budgets and international assistance\nin order to deliver the health-related MDGs, such as reducing infant\nmortality by increasing immunisation coverage, reducing maternal mortality\nby increasing access to skilled professionals, supporting research and\ndevelopment of and access to new diagnostics and therapies, providing safe\ndrinking water and sanitation, and scaling up significantly towards the\ngoal of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support of\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, TB and other diseases by 2010, including for\nmarginalised populations and those most vulnerable to infectious diseases;\n39.  Calls on the international donor community to assist developing\ncountries in developing and implementing comprehensive health action\nprogrammes, tackling issues such as the need to secure sustainable\nfinancing for health infrastructure and salaries, increase investment in\ntraining and avoid an excessive \"brain drain\" through the migration of\nhigh-skilled health workers;\n40.  Welcomes the Johannesburg Declaration of the 3rd Ordinary Session of\nthe AU Conference of Ministers of Health of 9-13 April 2007 on the\nStrengthening of Health Systems for Equity and Development as an important\ninitiative towards achieving the health MDGs; calls on the EU to support\nthe AU member states in implementing the programmes based on that\nDeclaration;\n\n\n\nAccess to medicines-R&D-  Flexibilities of TRIPs/Doha\n44.  Calls on the Commission to step up its commitment to combating\nHIV/AIDS in developing countries and to ensure that those most affected\nhave ever better access, at affordable prices, to prevention resources and\npolicies, antiretroviral treatments and healthcare services\n(infrastructure, personnel and medicines) capable of meeting the growing\ndemand;\n45.  Notes that all the MDGs are critically dependent on stemming the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic and asks the Commission to accord the highest priority\nto addressing this global pandemic by supporting an intensified and\ncomprehensive response; points out that the response should ensure\nuniversal access to existing prevention and treatment as well as adequate\ninvestment in the development of and universal access to a wide range of\nprevention technologies, including microbicides and vaccines; and calls on\nthe EU to promote greater industry participation, a more coordinated\nscientific effort, and policies and programmes that accelerate the testing\nof novel vaccines and microbicides;\n46.  Calls on the EU to increase funding to ensure that progress in basic\nscience and biomedicine results in new and affordable drugs, vaccines, and\ndiagnostics for neglected diseases, to support the development phases of\nR&D and to secure the use of new products by neglected populations whilst\nrespecting the TRIPS provisions;\n47.  Calls on the EU to support the full implementation of the Doha\nDeclaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of the WTO\nMinisterial Conference of 9-14 November 2001, and to ensure that medicines\nare affordable for those for those developing countries that do take\nmeasures in compliance with the Doha Declaration, and further calls on the\nEU to provide technical assistance to developing countries for the\nimplementation of pro-public-health measures in patent law;\n48.  Stresses the need for a comprehensive review of those systems in\nplace that are failing to solve the access to medicines problem, to\ninclude submitting recommendations to the WTO for amendment to its rules\ngoverning the export of medicines under compulsory licence, known as the\nAugust 30th decision;\n\n\n\nTrade- Bilateral/Regional agreements between EU and Developing countries\nrelated to access to medicines\n93.  Believes that pharmaceutical-related TRIPS affecting public health\nand access to medicines which go beyond the TRIPS Agreement should be\nexcluded from EPAs and other future bilateral or regional agreements with\nlow-income countries;\n94.  Believes that all ACP countries must have a clear right to choose\nwhether to extend the negotiations beyond trade in goods, and calls on the\nCommission to ensure that intellectual property rights and the Singapore\nissues (competition policy, public procurement and investment) are taken\noff the negotiating table if ACP countries do not wish to negotiate them;\n96.  Takes note of recent studies by UNCTAD and others which show that\nextensive trade liberalisation in LDCs has had little effect on sustained\nand substantial poverty reduction objectives and has contributed to a\ndecline in the terms of trade of developing countries, in particular of\nAfrican countries; and calls on the EU to start a sustained, sincere\ncampaign to genuinely increase the export capacity of LDCs by promoting\ntechnical assistance to further physio-sanitary standards, property law,\nbusiness skills and value-addition programmes;\n97.  Calls on the Commission to adjust its cooperation and trade policies\nas far as possible in order to help the governments of developing\ncountries to maintain and develop public services, particularly those\nguaranteeing access for the population as whole to drinking water, health\nservices, education and transport;\n\n\n\nAlexandra Heumber\nEU Advocacy Liaison Officer\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\nAccess to Essential Medicines Campaign\nRue Dupr\u00e9, 94. 1090 Brussels\n++32 (0) 2 474 75 09 (Dir off)\n++ 32 (0) 479 514 900 (Mob)\n++ 32 (0) 2 474 75 75 (Fax)\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
