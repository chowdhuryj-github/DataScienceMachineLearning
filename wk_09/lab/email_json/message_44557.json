I'm genuinely ignorant about this issue.\n\nThe usual rule on personal jurisdiction in civil suits is that a suit\nmust be filed where (a) the defendant(s) reside, (b) where the alleged\ntort took place or (c) in some place that the parties agreed would\nhave jurisdiction.  Neither the GPL nor GFDL have a choice-of-venue\nclause, so (c) would not apply.  If the courts in (a) decline to\nenforce judgments made by the courts in (b), then for practical\nreasons a plaintiff would be advised to file in (a).\n\nSimilarly, the applicable law would be (a) the law of the court\nhearing the case or (b) a set of law that the parties agreed to use.\nNeither the GPL nor GFDL have a choice-of-law clause, so (b) does not\napply.\n\nSo, under the usual rules, a prospective plaintiff would have to sue a\nUK resident in UK courts under UK law.  (IANAL, TINLA, and usual rules\nhave seldom stopped sufficiently determined plaintiffs in the past.)\n\n>> poison pill invariant sections\n>\n> Huh? Poison pill?\n\nPoison pills are clauses or sections that make it impractical to do\ncertain things.  The GFDL's definition of \"Secondary Section\" permit a\nvariety of poison pills, as other potential publishers or distributors\nmight see them.\n\n>> and inability to fix some sections.\n>\n> What do you want to fix?

The FSF's mailing address is one example of GPL\nboilerplate that has changed several times; I have no idea if people\ninclude that or any similar information in invariant sections.\n\nI looked at the Emacs manual[1] to check, but -- contrary to the usage\nrecommendation contained in the FDL itself -- could not find a\nstatement as to whether it contains any invariant sections.\n\n[1]- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
