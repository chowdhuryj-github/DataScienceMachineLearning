You may need to do this if you want to use different  \nplotting characters or sizes and overplotting doesn't look good.\n\nJose\n\n\n-- \nDr. Jose I. de las Heras                      Email: J.delasHeras@ed.ac.uk\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology    Phone: +44 (0)131 6513374\nInstitute for Cell & Molecular Biology        Fax:   +44 (0)131 6507360\nSwann Building, Mayfield Road\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nEdinburgh EH9 3JR\nUK\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
