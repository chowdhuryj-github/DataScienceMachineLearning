I am learning fast and with the help of the R community\nwill be able to get this going pretty soon. Of course, right now I am\njust trying to learn the language; so I am trying to program a standard\nprobit model for which I know the answers. I could easily get the\nestimates with \"glm\". But I want to program the probit model to make\nsure I understand the subtleties of R. \n\nI tried running the alternate script that you provided, but it is still\nnot working. Am I making some mistake?\n\nHere is what I get when I run your script (which shows that the maximum\nnumber of iterations was reached without convergence):\n\n> source(\"probit1.R\")\n> summary(out)\n            Length Class  Mode\npar         3      -none- numeric\nvalue       1      -none- numeric\ncounts      2      -none- numeric\nconvergence 1      -none- numeric\nmessage     0      -none- NULL\n\nHere is the script (exactly what you had suggested):\n\nmlogl <- function (mu, y, X) {\n    zeta <- as.vector(X %*% mu)\n    y.logic <- as.logical(y)\n    lgLik <- numeric(length(y))\n    lgLik[y.logic] <- pnorm(zeta[y.logic], log.p = TRUE)\n    lgLik[!y.logic] <- pnorm(zeta[!y.logic], lower.tail = FALSE, log.p =\nTRUE)\n    -sum(lgLik)\n}\n\nwomen <-\nread.table(\"http://wps.aw.com/wps/media/objects/2228/2281678/Data_Sets/ASCII/Women13.txt\", \nheader=TRUE)\n\nmu.start <- c(-3, -1.5, 0.5)\nout <- optim(mu.start, mlogl, method = \"BFGS\", y = women$J, X = cbind(1,\nwomen$M, women$S))\nout\n\nglm.fit(x = cbind(1, women$M, women$S), y = women$J, family =\nbinomial(link = \"probit\"))$coefficients\n\n\nThanks.\nDeepankar\n\n\nOn Thu, 2007-04-19 at 09:26 +0200, Dimitris Rizopoulos wrote:\n> try the following:\n> \n> mlogl <- function (mu, y, X) {\n>     zeta <- as.vector(X %*% mu)\n>     y.logic <- as.logical(y)\n>     lgLik <- numeric(length(y))\n>     lgLik[y.logic] <- pnorm(zeta[y.logic], log.p = TRUE)\n>     lgLik[!y.logic] <- pnorm(zeta[!y.logic], lower.tail = FALSE, log.p \n> = TRUE)\n>     -sum(lgLik)\n> }\n> \n> women <- \n> read.table(\"http://wps.aw.com/wps/media/objects/2228/2281678/Data_Sets/ASCII/Women13.txt\", \n> header=TRUE)\n> \n> mu.start <- c(0, -1.5, 0.01)\n> out <- optim(mu.start, mlogl, method = \"BFGS\", y = women$J, X = \n> cbind(1, women$M, women$S))\n> out\n> \n> glm.fit(x = cbind(1, women$M, women$S), y = women$J, family = \n> binomial(link = \"probit\"))$coefficients\n> \n> \n> I hope it helps.\n> \n> Best,\n> Dimitris\n> \n> ----\n> Dimitris Rizopoulos\n> Ph.D. Student\n> Biostatistical Centre\n> School of Public Health\n> Catholic University of Leuven\n> \n> Address: Kapucijnenvoer 35, Leuven, Belgium\n> Tel: +32/(0)16/336899\n> Fax: +32/(0)16/337015\n> Web: http://med.kuleuven.be/biostat/\n>      http://www.student.kuleuven.be/~m0390867/dimitris.htm\n> \n> \n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Deepankar Basu\" \n> To: \n> Sent: Thursday, April 19, 2007 12:38 AM\n> Subject: [R] Problems in programming a simple likelihood\n> \n> \n> > As part of carrying out a complicated maximum likelihood estimation, \n> > I\n> > am trying to learn to program likelihoods in R.
