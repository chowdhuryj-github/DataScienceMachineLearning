Is it time to try ggplot2?  I found I could get\nresults very quickly with ggplot, but am not sure how much control it\ngives me over the finer details.\n\nThanks.\n-- \nRoss Boylan                                      wk:  (415) 514-8146\n185 Berry St #5700                               ross@biostat.ucsf.edu\nDept of Epidemiology and Biostatistics           fax: (415) 514-8150\nUniversity of California, San Francisco\nSan Francisco, CA 94107-1739                     hm:  (415) 550-1062\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
