You can then\nassume that any ctx* passed in is longer lived and\nuse it appropriately.\n\nI admit I like they \"any pointer can be a context\" idea\nand use it for data structures but I also prefer the\n\"give me a defined context that I can use\" methodology\nfor use outside of a defined structure and method set.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD4DBQFGianlIR7qMdg1EfYRAkp5AJipL7LUDNCPGcbv5fw83Ap+hCHNAJwNnsZB\nXpewp1UiDDa+9nYV5cw3Rg==\n=IVYX\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
