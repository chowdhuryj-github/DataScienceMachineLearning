First, I'm using speakup \nwith festival and speech-dispatcher, and I occasionally get a sort of \nbroken echo.  Is there a way to fix this?  Second, is there a way I can \nhave speech-dispatcher and speechd-up start automatically with the \ncomputer?  I always have to do it manually after login.\n\nThanks,\nTerrence\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
