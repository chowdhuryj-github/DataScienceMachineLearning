[1]Centre, an open source student information system that has\nbeen around for a while, is part of the solution stack. They have a data\nwarehouse and are proposing an open source SIF alternative and an\nassessment solution. While the proof is in the pudding, these guys have\nworking demos and they look pretty good for a first run. K-12 education\nis in dire financial straits and solutions like these could help with\nlower TCO.

Bioware CEO Ray Muzyka has an\ninteresting answer to the question while talking about his pick:\nStarCraft. \" It's an unusual choice for me in that I'd normally pick a\nrole-playing game. But StarCraft has a strong campaign editor to make new\ncontent (including making either combat-oriented or story-based\ncampaigns), plus you can play both the solid single-player campaign and\nagainst the A.I., and -- here's the trick -- you can play on a LAN or WAN\n(you said no Internet, but didn't mention local or wide area\nnetworks...my goal would be to build a WAN -- I'd explain how, but that\nwould be telling -- connecting other folks similarly dropped onto nearby\ndesert islands by other videogame online sites, who are equally eager to\nplay some competitive multiplayer RTS or try out the campaigns I've\ncreated to kill time on the long days where there's nothing else to do\nbut collect coconuts and build rafts.\" So, assuming that you have\neverything you need to play, what game would you want to take with you\ninto seclusion?\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/07/173222\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3159208\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| How the RIAA has Dodged RICO Charges                               |\n|   from the still-quite-a-racket dept.                              |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 07, @13:53 (The Courts)    |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/07/1657251          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nGerardo writes \"Wondering why the RIAA hasn't been hit with racketeering\ncharges over its shady legal fight against file-sharing?
