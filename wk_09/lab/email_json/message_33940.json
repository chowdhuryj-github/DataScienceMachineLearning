He wants to see if anyone is connected to that area with\n\"smbstatus\". The attacker uploads util.js and hey presto the attacker\nhas just got the admin to run his code inside smbstatus, as root.\n\nSame applies to someones home directory.\n\nThere is a very good reason why \".\" is not in $PATH on unix by\ndefault :-)\n\nPlease revert this one. It's a major security hole.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
