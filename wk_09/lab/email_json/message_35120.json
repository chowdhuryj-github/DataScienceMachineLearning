The latter is rarely used, probably\nbecause it looks so awkward; but those are the only two recognised\nunder the law. The '(C)' representation is *not* recognised under\ncopyright law.\n\nPresumably, your 7-bit ASCII keyboard can produce 'copr.'. Then, when\nyou've done that, join us in the third millennium where we have\ninternational character sets. (And, incidentally, where we have the\nBerne convention, making most of this dicussion moot by creating\ncopyright monopolies even in the absence of explicit copyright\nnotices.)\n\n-- \n \\       \"I have a map of the United States; it's actual size.
