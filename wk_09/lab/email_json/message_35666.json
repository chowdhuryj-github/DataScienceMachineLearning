This has\nbeen a long standing policy and IIRC not the first time that\nyou failed to merge your own fixes.  I've mailed the list\nseveral times when the release branch was sync'd with\nSAMBA_3_0_25.  You have to realize that if you don't check\nyou code it, it would not be in the 25a release.\n\nbtw...the only tree that is actually locked is\nSAMBA_3_0_RELEASE.  The SAMBA_3_0_25 may be temporarily\nfrozen but what that means is that I'm not pulling in\nany more changes from that branch currently.\n\n> I was awaiting release of 3.0.25a with these changes, \n> and this is going to completely screw me up.

In the future, please merge your\nown changes.   The strategy is straightforward:\n\nSAMBA_3_0_25 \t\t-> Samba 3.0.25 series\nSAMBA_3_0_26\t\t-> Samba 3.0.26 series\nSAMBA_3_0\t\t-> research or works-in-progress\n\nI'm not planning any bulk merges between SAMBA_3_0 and\nSAMBA_3_0_26.  I might do some house cleaning but don't\ndepend on it for inclusion in the release.\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGVeGtIR7qMdg1EfYRAs/OAKCJionf6aqLh1hbER1pQXKLDAnlLQCgpMoI\nRBbzPl1EOCU58jvrVLhdkAo=\n=UEra\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
