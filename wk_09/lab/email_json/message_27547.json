We don't. \nOur advice for everyone shopping for medications on the Web is to cling to reliable licensed pharmacies that have been operating on the Internet market for quite a long time already (such as CanadianPharmacy). Want to save on drugs? Try CanadianPharmacy - #1 discount Canadian pharmacy.\nCanadianPharmacy your #1 source for cheap generic drugs from Canada.\nBest regards,Opal Morris\n\n\n\n\n"}
