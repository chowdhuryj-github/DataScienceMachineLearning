Please\nevaluate the comment about 'sigaction err'.  Try to cover all branches\nand conditions.  Check latest reports of Parrot configuration tools\ntesting coverage to see where your time available for writing tests is\nspent.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
