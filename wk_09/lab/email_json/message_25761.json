These combined forces\nwill result in quality assured, heat-stable form of lopinavir/ritonavir (a\nKaletra equivalent) being available soon at $695/pppy even in middle income\ncountries, undercutting Abbott's last offer by over 30%.  There is also a\nonce-a-day, fixed-dose combination of tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, a WHO\nrecommended therapy equivalent to Gilead and Merck's Atripla, now available\nfor $339/pppy, making it 45% cheaper than the current rate available for\nlow-income countries and 67% cheaper than the current rate for\nmiddle-income countries.  Purchases of these medicines and their rational\nprocurement for 27 countries will be supported by UNITAID through 2008 to\nthe tune of $100 million, funded with a recent air travel tax.  The quality\nof these medicines will be assured through prequalification at the WHO\nwhich should provoke fast-track registration of medicines by national drug\nregulatory authorities.\n\nHistory of this breakthrough\n\nAt the Toronto International AIDS Conference last August, MSF and AIDS\nactivists alerted the world to the impending crash between anemic funding\nfor universal-access-by-2010 and the looming costs of more expensive first-\nand second-line therapies, frequently 10 to 36 time more expensive than\nolder first-line therapies in low- and middle-income countries\nrespectively.  Although the cost of older, first-line therapies had\ncontinued to plummet, and are now as low as $90/pppy in some instances, the\ncosts of improved and more highly recommended first-line therapies were\nmuch higher because of patent protections.  The costs of second-line\ntherapies, especially those involving Tenofovir or Kaletra were even higher\nbecause of the absence of any generic competition whatsoever, meaning that\nthe future costs of universal access (9.8 million on treatment by 2010 and\nas many as 3-4 million new patients per year thereafter, many of whom would\nneed second-line therapies after 5 or 6 years) were set to explode.\n\nThe difference between the affordability of older first-line therapies and\nthe unaffordability of newer therapies had two explanations.  First, the\nolder therapies were unpatented in India, where equivalent generic\nmedicines could be produced cheaply, and also unpatented in most Africa\ncountries, where the bulk of latent demand existed.  In contrast, newer\nmedicines were much more widely patented, with patent applications pending\nin India's 1995-2005 transitional patent mailbox and already granted\nthroughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  Second, the market dynamics\nwere different.  Whereas, millions of people immediately needed access to\nmore affordable first-line therapies and no-patent markets could be\naggregated to encourage generic entry by multiple producers, the market for\ncheaper second-line therapies was much smaller because few developing\ncountries had started wide-scale treatment programs before the creation of\nthe Global Fund.  Because of this slow start for treatment, the numbers of\npatients needing second-line therapies, either because of adverse\nside-effects or because of the inevitable development of drug resistance\nover time, was relatively small, producing fewer market incentives for\ngeneric entry and reduced prospect to quick economies of scale.\n\nBrazil was the main exception to paralysis in treatment rollout as it\ncommitted to universal free access to care almost immediately after highly\nactive antiretroviral therapy was discovered.  Accordingly, patient that\nbegan treatment in 1997-98 began to need alternative therapies by 2003.\nUnfortunately, however, instead of helping to create a generic market by\nactually issuing compulsory licenses for second-line medicines, Brazil\nthreatened compulsory licenses but ultimately settled on temporary price\ndiscounts.\n\nAs the growing demand for HAART threatened AIDS budget in several\ndeveloping countries, a few countries boldly granted compulsory licenses on\nAIDS medicines, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Ghana, Eritrea, Zambia,\nZimbabwe, and Mozambique (the threat of compulsory licenses in a South\nAfrican competition case prompted multiple voluntary licenses).  These\nlicenses were relatively uncontroversial because they primarily affected\nfirst-generation medicines.  However, this past November and January,\nThailand took the lead and issued government-use licenses for Merck's\nefavirenz and Abbott's Kaletra, immediately creating market pull for\ngeneric entry.  Two months later, on May 4, Brazil followed suit and issued\na compulsory license on efavirenz, thereby adding market demand for nearly\n75,000 patients who will be on efavirenz by the end of 2007.\n\nHow compulsory license have led to price reduction both from Pharma and\nfrom generic producers\n\nThe efavirenz story is especially instructive.  Until Thailand issued its\ncompulsory license, Merck priced efavirenz at $276/pppy in first-tier\ncountries and $697/pppy in second-tier countries, including Thailand and\nBrazil.  (Generic prices ranged from $217-$299 from various producers to\nvarious countries.)  When Thailand issued its compulsory license on\nefavirenz, Merck responded in February by reducing its price in Thailand to\n$237, a price it later extended to least-developed and higher prevalence\ncountries (above 1%) in February.  Because Thailand could still purchase\n17% more cheaply from India at approximately $197/pppy, it has already\nordered 66,000 bottles from Ranbaxy in India.  Also, in February, Abbott\nproportionately reduced its price in medium human development index\ncountries $657/pppy, a price that Brazil found inadequate.  When Merck\nrefused to budge, Brazil notified Merck of its intent to issue a compulsory\nlicense at which time Merck offered a further 30% reduction to $401.50\n/pppy.  Because Brazil can procure from India for $170, it has rejected\nMerck's last ditch offer and issued a compulsory license.\n\nThe history of Kaletra prices is similarly dramatic.  Historically, Abbott\ncharged highly variable prices in low- and lower-middle-income countries\nranging from $3000-$6000/pppy.  In August 2006, in response to activist\npressure, Abbott announced a uniform mid-tier price of $2200/pppy, still\nfar to high for cash strapped developing countries and their resident.\nAlthough negotiations with Thailand continued and Abbott's president claims\nto have offered a $1700/pppy price, Thailand issued a compulsory license on\nJanuary 24, 2007.  Abbott retaliated by withdrawing seven medicines from\nThai's regulatory approval process, including the heat-stable form of\nKaletra.  In response to public outcry, however, Abbott offered a further\nmid-tier price reduction to $1000, but refused to resume registration\nproceedings in Thailand until the license was withdrawn.  In the meantime,\nBrazil, which had entered into a six-year price-discount agreement with\nAbbott, was stuck with an annual price tag per patient per year of\napproximately $1500 for Kaletra.  Fortunately, for it, Abbott's mid-tier\nprice discount extended to Brazil, but Brazil is still bound to purchase\nfrom Abbott.  However, Thailand and other countries without patents on\nKaletra or that issue compulsory licenses can not purchase a heat-stable\nversion of lopinavir/ritonavir for only $695/pppy, a 30% saving.  These\nprices will fall even further as more generic producers enter the market,\ngain WHO prequalification, and compete for a growing population of PWAs\nneeding second-line therapies.\n\nThe role of the Clinton Foundation, generic companies, UNITAID, and WHO\n\nAt the same time that developing countries were escalating their\nprosecuting compulsory licenses, the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative\nwas working behind the scene with generic companies Cipla and Matrix to\nsource cheaper active pharmaceutical ingredients, to identify production\neconomies, to identify needed second-line and fixed-dose combination\nmedicines, and to help expedite the filing of data dossiers to the WHO\nPrequalification Project.  Although the pharmacists and technical experts\nplayed a critical role in these negotiations, they were greatly added by\nthe presence of new purchasing power for second-line medicines organized by\nUNITAID, the beneficiary of a new airline travel tax.  UNITAID had\nidentified additional purchasing power and simplified procurement of\nsecond-line medicines as key step in the road to universal access, so it\nharnessed its energy and technical expertise to the new second-line\ninitiative.  Finally, WHO is playing a critical as it expedites review of\nproduct dossiers already filed.  It is hoped that prequalification will be\nannounced in the next few months.\n\nThreats on the horizon\n\nAlthough great progress has been made, there are threats on the horizon\nfrom drug companies, from the U.S. government, and from the rigidity of the\npost-TRIPS intellectual property regime.  The drug companies have responded\nwith monopoly-profit-related anxiety to the announcement of compulsory\nlicenses in Thailand and Brazil and have gone on public relations\ndisinformation campaigns directly and through their proxies such as USA for\nInnovation.  Even though the TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration make\nit exquisitely clear that countries are free to issue compulsory licenses\non any grounds they choose and to forego negotiations when the licenses are\nfor government, non-commercial use, Big Pharma has cried \"foul,\" claiming\nerroneously that Thailand and Brazil are too rich to issue compulsory\nlicenses, or that protracted prior negotiations other than what already\noccurred was required, or that licenses cannot be granted to\ngovernment-owned pharmaceutical companies.  Even more egregiously,\ncompanies like Abbott are threatening to withhold life-saving medicines\nfrom developing countries that issue compulsory licenses.  Though we can\nhope that these threats will not cause Thailand and Brazil to back down,\nthere is a risk that they will deter smaller, poorer, and weaker developing\ncountries.\n\nFortunately, the price reductions, threats, and distortions from Pharma are\nbecoming less and less significant as licenses are issued and generic\nproducers offer substantial price discounts.  However, there is another\nthreat on the horizon in the form of trade threats from the United States\nTrade Representative, which has just put Thailand on the Special 301\nPriority Watch-List because it dared to issue three TRIPS-compliant\ngovernment-use licenses.  The U.S.T.R. used the same kind of watch-list\npressure when negotiating the original TRIPS Agreement and again when South\nAfrica passed a law that would have allowed parallel importation of branded\nmedicines sold more cheaply in another country.  Unfortunately, the U.S. is\nnot content with trade threats, it has also been on an intensive campaign\nto impose TRIPS-plus and U.S.-law-plus intellectual property protections on\ndeveloping countries in regional and bilateral free trade agreements.  Even\nthough Trade Promotion Authority is set to expire at the end of June, a\ndozen negative FTAs are already signed or in the pipeline, and it is not\nobvious that the new Democrats majority in Congress is fully committed to\ncurtailing Pharma hegemony.\n\nFinally, the international architecture of the TRIPS regime has only just\nbeen implemented in the most important producer countries like India.\nAlthough sources for older pre-1995 generic medicines are secure, options\nfor sourcing newer, post-1995 medicines will get increasingly harder as\npatents are granted in India and elsewhere.  The cumbersome Paragraph 6\nImplementation Decision of August 30, 2003, creates a procedural labyrinth\nwhich must soon be navigated with multiple quantity specific licenses is\ndrug-by-drug and country-by-country in both importing and exporting\ncountries.  Although these obstacles are not insurmountable, they will\ncomplicate efforts to find good quality generic producers who can continue\nto act as pharmacies for the poor.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping countries, activists, and international organizations must stand\nunited in condemning drug company retaliation, U.S. threats against use of\nlawful flexibilities for accessing more affordable medicines, and the\ninefficiencies of the new import/export regime. In the meantime, other\ndeveloping countries should take heart from the example of Thailand and\nBrazil.  After making sure to amend their laws to avail themselves of all\nneeded flexibilities for accessing medicines more cheaply, they should\nnegotiate for voluntary licenses or grant compulsory licenses on essential,\nlife-saving medicines, not just for AIDS but for other conditions as well.\nTheir efforts will be simplified if they cooperate with UNITAID and with\nproposals for patent pools for essential medicines that will allow for\ncollective management of intellectual property rights, including patents\nand registration data rights.  Through increased cooperation, coordination,\nand determination, developing countries can expedite the emergence of a\ndynamic generic market that will inevitably lead to even lower drug prices.\nIf those efforts are combined with efforts to expand funding for Universal\nAccess and to even greater efforts to increase human resources for health\nand to rehabilitate tattered health systems, universal access might pass\nfrom a hope to a reality.\n\nProfessor Brook K.
