If you licence BY-NC-SA, then \ncommercial uses are reserved from use under the terms of cc, and can therefore \nbe licenced through ASCAP, and renumerated. Bear in mind that NC doesn't \nmean that third parties can *never* use your work commercially, simply that they \nhave to seek permission (or obtain another licence, such as an ASCAP public \nperformance licence) before doing so. IANAL, \nATINLA.Cheers,Tim\n"}
