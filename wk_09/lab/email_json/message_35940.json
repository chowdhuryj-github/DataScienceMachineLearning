A contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties. The choice\nmust be expressed or demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of\nthe contract or the circumstances of the case. By their choice the parties\ncan select the law applicable to the whole or a part only of the contract.\nhttp://www.rome-convention.org/instruments/i_conv_cons_en.htm\n\nThere are only limited exceptions to the above rule.\n\nAs far as I can tell, a European licensee is free to agree with\na US author/licensor that US law (e.g. New York law) applies\nto their license agreement.\n\nChoice of *venue* is a bit more restricted, Europeans have the\nright to go to their local court for any dispute. Of course a\nUS court may feel it has jurisdiction, which may make life\nvery interesting once a verdict has been issued and the European\nperson goes on holiday to the USA.\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
