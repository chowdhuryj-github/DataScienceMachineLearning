I have had no\nproblems with SPSS 12 but 14 seems a bit nasty. \n\n\n Sometime I may get a change to build a couple of test\nfiles in SPSS that I can check. \n\n>Avoiding read.spss is a perfectly\n> reasonable strategy, and is \n> in fact what we have always recommended in the Data\n> Import-Export manual.\n\nI have simply moved to exporting the SPSS file to a\ndelimited file and loading it. Unfortunately I'm\nlosing all the labelling which can be time-consuming\nto redo.    Some of the data has something like 10\ncategories for a variable.\n\n> \n> AFAIK the only commercial statistical software\n> vendor that does provide \n> complete, public documentation of their file formats\n> is Stata, and this \n> is one reason why there are fewer complaints about\n> read.dta and write.dta. \n> It also probably helps that the code was written by\n> someone who uses Stata \n> -- there hasn't been much contribution of code or\n> patches for the \n> foreign package from SPSS users.\n> \n> \n>  \t-thomas\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
