Fun! I think it's disgusting it's just running around. It's not my idea of pleasure.\nIt's not the having, it's the getting.\nThe sooner I fall behind, the more time I have to catch up.\nAs a small businessperson, you have no greater leverage than the truth.\nIf you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\nThe discontented man finds no easy chair.\nNever find fault with the absent.\nPerfection of means and confusion of goals seem -- in my opinion -- to characterize our age.\nThe courage we desire and prize is not the courage to die decently, but to live manfully.\nAdvertising is the very essence of democracy.\nI always begin at the left with the opening word of the sentence and read toward the right and I recommend this method.\nThe sounder your argument, the more satisfaction you get out of it.\nLive so that you can at least get the benefit of the doubt.\nI have known a German Prince with more titles than subjects, and a Spanish nobleman with more names than shirts.\nAs soon as beauty is sought not from religion and love, but for pleasure, it degrades the seeker.\nThe world cares very little about what a man or woman knows it is what a man or woman is able to do that counts.\n\u00a0"}
