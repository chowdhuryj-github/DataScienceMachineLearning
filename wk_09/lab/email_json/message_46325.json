If you are refused a LOCK_EX, then someone\nholds either a LOCK_SH or a LOCK_EX, so you shouldn't\ntry to update the file.\n\nthank you\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nPinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell. \nhttp://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
