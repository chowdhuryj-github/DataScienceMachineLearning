We take\na lot for granted with distros, it's generally easy to build kernels\nbut the toolchain can be a bear. Note that the library enu50.so\n(the speech engine) not only required an old glibc, it had to be\ninvoked using old loader. When I did this I had two glibc versions\nand two loader versions on my system. I don't know if there is a\nbetter way, but this approach worked on slackware and lfs.\n\nAt one point I was able to get it working on newer slackware\nby using old binaries, but that eventually was not reliable anymore.\nI have no idea if that is still true today, or if the instructions in my\narchived message still work, apparently I did it three years ago.\n\nAlso from my notes, on slackware I used rpm2tgz to unpack viavoice.\nNow I remember, the rpm tool choked because of dependencies.\n\nI spent an insane amount of time getting viavoice working on\nnewer system. I for one have appreciation for what was done\nwith TTSynth, whatever that was I have no idea.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
