In Perl 6, where sigils\ndistinguish nouns not only from verbs, but also from adjectives (if\nyou count types as adjectival).  With a glance you can tell which\nare the nouns and which are the types here:\n\n    multi CatDog sub make_catdog (Cat $cat, Dog $dog) {...}\n    multi CatDog sub make_catdog (Cat Dog $catdog) {...}\n\nWhile Gabor is correct that in Perl 5 removing the sigils from verbs\nmade some verbal collisions happen that otherwise wouldn't have, in\nPerl 6 we've mostly fixed that by essentially getting rid of most\nreserved words, and making even the builtin functions participate\nas normal multis and methods.  For that reason, and because verbs\nlinguistically tend to be disambiguated by the nouns fed to them as\nargements, verbs don't need to be conjugated nearly as badly as nouns\nneed to be declined.  A lot of nouns typically don't have arguments\nto disambiguate them with, at least until you start subscripting them,\nand we don't do multiple dispatch on subscripts.\n\nAs for the original complaint, we long ago decided to ignore people who\nare prejudiced against languages that mark nouns.  Greek wouldn't be\nGreek if you couldn't decline your nouns.  (In my estimation, it's\nthe conjugated verbs that make Greek so difficult to learn, really.\nOn the other hand, once you learn them they're very expressive in\ntense and aspect.  It's all tradeoffs.)\n\nLarry\n\n"}
