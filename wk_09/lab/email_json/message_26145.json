Maybe try to upgrade to the\nlatest versions of OpenSSL and try to rebuild Crypt::SSLeay. \n\n\nzentara\n\n\n\n-- \nI'm not really a human, but I play one on earth.\nhttp://zentara.net/japh.html\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
