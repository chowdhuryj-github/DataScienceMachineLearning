He decided after his glittering track career that the marathon was going to be his event. \n\n\nHe didn't take to it too kindly at first, but he's adapted his training, approached things differently and is now bang in form. \n\n\nAs far as British interest is concerned we are once again relying on Jon Brown. \n\n\nHe has been a great athlete for his country and is our only male world-class marathon runner but I don't expect him to feature, which can also be said of Liz Yelling in the women's elite race. \n\n\nLornah Kiplagat is my favourite for that event after her performance holding off the challenge of the Ethiopians at the recent World Cross Country Championships. \n\n\nShe will face the might of Berhane Adere and Gete Wami on Sunday, but I think she is strong enough to prevail again. \n\n\nEnjoy the race, \n\n\nBrendan \n\n\nBrendan Foster MBE will be commentating on Sunday's London Marathon (coverage starts at 0830 BST on BBC ONE).\n\nDuring his athletics career he won an Olympic bronze medal in the 10,000m and broke two world records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS WEEKEND ON BBC SPORT\n\u00a0All the TV and radio times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON MARATHON\n\u00a0bbc.co.uk/athletics\nSunday\n0830-1400, BBC ONE and BBC Sport website; 0800-1600, BBCi and BBC Sport website; 0900-1300, BBC Radio Five Live.
