The Star Wars d20\nproduct line, which saw print from 2000 to late 2004, attempted to\ncapture the epic adventure that is the Star Wars setting within a simple\nquantifiable ruleset. Unfortunately, the d20 rules (circa 2000) were far\ntoo clumsy to make the RPG 'feel' like Star Wars. Even a 2002 Revised\nCore Rules book did little to create an intuitive play experience. Now,\nin time for the setting's 30th anniversary, Wizards has released a brand\nnew edition of the rules, marking a relaunch of the product line. Dubbed\nthe 'Saga Edition', it has completely revamped the d20 rules to meet with\ndemands for Star Warsyness.

Ars covers the fracas and\n[1]gives more time to Verizon than the local media do. From Ars: 'During\ntestimony given before the Virginia State Corporation Commission last\nweek... workers painted a dire picture of the state of Verizon's copper\nnetwork, saying that the equipment required to make repairs \\u2014 including\ntools and cable \\u2014 is not even available.' Verizon disagrees, saying that\nwhile it's a challenge to manage and maintain both networks, they are not\nneglecting their copper infrastructure.\" A union official gave written\ntestimony about the Verizon problems, presumably so that individual\nworkers would not have to testify in public and open themselves to\nretribution.\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/12/182244\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.dailypress.com/business/local/dp-48696sy0jun10,0,53947.story?coll=dp-business-localheads\n    1. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070611-verizon-denies-neglecting-copper-infrastructure-in-favor-of-fiber.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| No iPhone SDK Means No iPhone Killer Apps                          |\n|   from the dang-no-photoshop dept.                                 |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday June 12, @15:49 (Communications)    |\n|   http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/12/1922232        |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\niPhoneLover/Hater writes \"Gizmodo is running an article analyzing the\npotential [0]failure of the iPhone as a truly revolutionary platform. The\nreason: no SDK to harness the true power of Mac OS X and the frameworks\ncontained in Apple's smart cell. From the article: 'According to Apple,\n\"no software developer kit is required for the iPhone.\" However, the\ntruth is that the lack of an SDK means that there won't be a killer\napplication for the iPhone. It also means the iPhone's potential as an\namazing computing and communication platform will never be realized. And\nbecause of this and no matter how Apple tries to sell it, the iPhone\nwon't make a revolution happen.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/12/1922232\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/fast-and-furious/no-iphone-sdk-means-no-iphone-killer-apps-267899.php\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Location-Based Search Was Patented In 1999                         |\n|   from the can-you-spell-champerty dept.                           |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday June 12, @16:41 (Patents)           |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/12/196234           |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\ngreenbird writes \"Another patent fiasco has begun.
