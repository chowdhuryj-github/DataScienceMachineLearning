The\nthing with the 64bit Vista is that there is much less software driver\nsupport at the moment. So if you will not use more than 4GB and want to\nuse it for other purposes than you might prefer the 32bit Vista... My\npersonal subjective feeling is that Vista is slower then XP. So I would\nsay thats not the only reason to go for Linux.\n\nStefan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
