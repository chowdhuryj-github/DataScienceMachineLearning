As soon as this file is create,\nrun an R function, and output a file.\n\nThen, do the same in Excel: write a file (I _think_ this is possible\nwith macros), enter into a loop waiting for the other file to\nbe created, and procceed after that.\n\nSlow, but better than to use Excel alone :-)\n\nAlberto Monteiro\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
