Looks like you are trying to create a sorted\ngroup of tickets from the original data.\n\nI personally would be using a Database,  loading it in if necessary and\nthen doing a simple select:\n\nselect action_creator, ticket_customer, ticket_number, ticket_subject\nfrom my_table\norder by action_creator, ticket_customer, ticket_number, ticket_subject\n\nIn fact the whole thing looks like a database application waiting to\nhappen.\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
