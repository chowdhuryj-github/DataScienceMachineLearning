You can run R quite nicely from a USB and it\nmight indicate if it is R or a corrupt file that is\nthe problem.\n\n \n \n> \n> Liaw, Andy wrote:\n> > What are the versions of R on the two platform? \n> Is the version on Unix\n> > at least as new as the one on Windows?\n> > \n> > Andy \n> > \n> > From: toby909@gmail.com\n> > \n> >>Hi All\n> >>\n> >>I am saving a dataframe in my MS-Win R with\n> save().\n> >>Then I copy it onto my personal AFS space.\n> >>Then I start R and run it with emacs and load()\n> the data.\n> >>It loads only 2 lines: head() shows only two lines\n> nrow() als \n> >>say it has only 2 \n> >>lines, I get error message, when trying to use\n> this data \n> >>object, saying that \n> >>some row numbers are missing.\n> >>If anyone had similar situation, I appreciate\n> letting me know.\n> >>\n> >>Best Toby\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
