Best solution?", "body": "Keith Hinton wrote:\n> Hi all,\n> My father is a person who expects Windows\n\n     Had a similar problem with my computer illiterate father.  I told\nhim that \"the next time you break it, you have to fix it.\"  Luckily,\nthat got him off my system permanently.  I'd suggest a dual-boot system.\n  One where he can select Windows, but can't boot Linux without a\npassword.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to see the lilo prompts.  I\nknow nothing about grub.  If you can handle that, he'll never be able to\ntrash your Linux partition.  Windows XP can take care of itself.\nPersonally, I'd set up a dual-boot system with password protected Linux,\nand a DOS prompt.   Let him freakin' try using that.  That's bullcrapp, \nwrecking your computer just because he pays for the power.  If you have \nany income, tell him you'll pay for the computer's electrical use.  In \nany case, if he insists on breaking  the thing, insist that he effing\nix it if he wants to continue using it.  BTW, I use removable hard drive \ntrays.  You can plug in one or the other at whim.  If you can afford \ntwin hard drives, I'd go that way.
