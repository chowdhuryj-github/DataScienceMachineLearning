Still give the same problem. Although I thought \nit's the .htaccess job to locate those Perl's lib path.\n\n>you may need to set the \"SetEnv\" direction in the httpd.conf.\nHow do you do that?\nI can't see any directive related to that. Please advice.\n\n--\nEdward WIJAYA\nSINGAPORE\n\n\n2007/4/9, Wijaya Edward :\n>\n>\n> Dear experts,\n>\n> I have the following simple Perl script (called \"hellom.cgi\"):\n>\n> __BEGIN__\n> #!/usr/bin/perl\n> use CGI qw/:standard :html3/;\n> use CGI::Carp qw( fatalsToBrowser );\n> $CGI::POST_MAX=1024 * 100;  # max 100K posts1\n>\n> #--------------------------------------------------\n> # BEGIN {\n> #     if ( $ENV{PERL5LIB} and $ENV{PERL5LIB} =~ /^(.*)$/ ) {\n> #\n> #         # Blindly untaint.  Taintchecking is to protect\n> #         # from Web data;\n> #         # the environment is under our control.\n> #         eval \"use lib '$_';\" foreach (\n> #             reverse\n> #             split( /:/, $1 )\n> #         );\n> #     }\n> # }\n> #--------------------------------------------------\n>\n> use Acme::Spork;\n> use Bio::Tools::GuessSeqFormat;\n> use IO::String;\n> use File::Slurp qw(read_file);\n> print \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\";\n> print \"Hello World !! It works.\\n\";\n>\n> __END__\n>\n> Which is stored under: /usr/local/apache/htdocs/Test/cgi-bin\n> And the actual website can be accessed here:\n> http://bioinfo-z.comp.nus.edu.sg/Test/cgi-bin/hellom.cgi\n>\n> As you can see from that link it shows that it can't locate Acme::Spork,\n> at the shown path there. But I have set .htaccess to contain this:\n>\n> SetEnv PERL5LIB\n> /home/sadm/lib/site_perl/sun4-solaris-64int:/home/sadm/lib/site_perl/\n>\n> I have the .htaccess here: /usr/local/apache/htdocs/Test\n>\n>\n> Moreover checking the location of the module it consistently shows\n>\n> the correct path:\n> sadm@bioinfo-z:~$ perldoc -l Acme::Spork\n> /home/sadm/lib/site_perl/Acme/Spork.pm\n>\n> My question is why my Apache can't locate the location\n> given the correct .htaccess? Thus my script won't work?\n>\n> My httpd.conf is this: http://dpaste.com/8163/plain/\n> My modules.conf is this: http://dpaste.com/8164/plain/\n>\n> Hope to hear from you again\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> ------------ Institute For Infocomm Research - Disclaimer -------------\n> This email is confidential and may be privileged.
