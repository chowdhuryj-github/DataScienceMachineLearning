He also had ordered his militia off the streets to prevent conflict with U.S. forces.\n\nHis return to the Shiite holy city of Najaf appeared to be an effort by the 33-year-old firebrand cleric to regain control over his militia, which had begun fragmenting, and to take advantage of the illness of a Shiite rival. There also had been some indication that his absence from the national arena was costing him political support.\n\nAl-Sadr drove in a long motorcade from Najaf to its sister city of Kufa to deliver an anti-American sermon to 6,000 chanting supporters at the main mosque.--!>Visit here to get enrolled for your Health Care degree!      \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
