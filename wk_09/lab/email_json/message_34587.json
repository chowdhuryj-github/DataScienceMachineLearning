I am having difficulties\nsetting the dimensions of the screens in a way that\nwould allow me to have the screen dedicated to the\nlegend smaller. I end up with a very awkward aspect at\nthe end: 4 small plots with a big space for the\nlegend. The gend needs to be at the top of the 4\ngraphs, it's common legend for the 4 graphs. I have\ntried manipulating the margins of each individual\nscreen, but couldn't obtain the desired aspect.\n\nThank you very much in advance for you help.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nJ\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________You snooze, you lose.
