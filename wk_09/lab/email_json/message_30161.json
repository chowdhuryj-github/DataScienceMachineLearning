It sounds like either la.mx.develooper.com is\nnot properly sending the acknowledgments to nz-out-0506.google.com or\nnz-out-0506.google.com is not processing them properly.  I don't know\nwho is adding on the Newsgroups: header, but it isn't me.  The\nfollowing is what I am handing off to Google.  Since I have no control\nover either machine my only suggestion is to use a mail reader merges\nor discards duplicate Message-IDs.  That will also stop you from\ngetting dups when I reply to both you and the list (as I am doing now\nbecause I am too lazy to do anything but hit \"reply to all\").\n\nReceived: by 10.114.79.3 with HTTP; Mon, 14 May 2007 20:53:50 -0700 (PDT)\nMessage-ID: <58ce48dc0705142053v264fffd5g6b47bf8ebe1c6775@mail.gmail.com>\nDate: Mon, 14 May 2007 23:53:50 -0400\nFrom: \"Chas Owens\" \nTo: \"Kent Frazier\" \nSubject: Re: Attempting to update files blanks them instead\nCc: \"Perl Beginners List\" \nIn-Reply-To: <427372c20705142016k34134d71s5b5fedf5bc658ff3@mail.gmail.com>\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nReferences: <427372c20705140255h580f64a3gff9c2e90ca35e376@mail.gmail.com>\n\t <58ce48dc0705140748v32e237derf46c3fc6c8d07bf6@mail.gmail.com>\n\t <427372c20705142016k34134d71s5b5fedf5bc658ff3@mail.gmail.com>\nDelivered-To: chas.owens@gmail.com\n\nOn 5/14/07, Kent Frazier  wrote:\n> That did the trick.
