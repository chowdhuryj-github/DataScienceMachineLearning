Invocations by 'make':\n\n  94 tools/build/c2str.pl\n   4 tools/build/dynpmc.pl\n   1 tools/build/fingerprint_c.pl\n   2 tools/build/jit2c.pl\n   1 tools/build/nativecall.pl\n  12 tools/build/ops2c.pl\n   1 tools/build/ops2pm.pl\n   2 tools/build/parrot_config_c.pl\n 179 tools/build/pmc2c.pl\n   1 tools/build/revision_c.pl\n   1 tools/build/vtable_extend.pl\n\ntools/build/vtable_h.pl has not been invoked by make since Nov 11 2006.  However, it may \nbe invoked elsewhere.  See config/gen/parrot_include.pm (54); lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/\nTools.pm (51); lib/Parrot/Vtable.pm (16, 419).\n\n2.  Quite a few of the tools/build/*.pl scripts are called by Parrot::Docs::Sections::Tools.  \nPersonally, I don't think providing a Perl script as an argument to a Perl method call is a \"best \npractice.\"  So I view these instances as ripe for refactoring.\n\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:49:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/nativecall.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:50:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/jit2c.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:51:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/vtable_h.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:52:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/\nvtable_extend.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:56:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/pbc2c.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:82:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/\nfingerprint_c.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:85:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/\nparrot_config_c.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:87:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/\nrevision_c.pl' ),\nlib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:104:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/\nlist_unjitted.pl' ),\n\nI haven't yet looked at scripts in other directories such as tools/dev/.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
