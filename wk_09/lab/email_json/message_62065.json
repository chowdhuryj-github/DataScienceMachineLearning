And the sugar shell sets \nit to \n/home/erikos/sugar-jhbuild/build/lib/pkgconfig:/home/erikos/sugar-jhbuild/build/share/pkgconfig. \nI guess this is an error on my system then.\n\n\n>> Another error is during the build of hulahop:\n>> /home/erikos/sugar-jhbuild/build/lib/libglib-2.0.so -lxul -lpyxpcom \n>> -lxpcomglue_s  -Wl,-soname -Wl,_hulahop.so -o .libs/_hulahop.so\n>> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lxpcomglue_s\n>> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n>> make[1]: *** [_hulahop.la] Error 1\n>>\n>> Which package do I need to install for the shared library xpcomglue_s, \n>> googled for it but could not really find out about it?\n>>\n>>   \n> \n> I checked in a fix for this yesterday night.
