It follows up commitments made by Chad in February at the \u2018Free Children from War\u2019 conference, which was held in Paris and organized by UNICEF and the French Government. \nThat conference resulted in the Paris Principles, an agreement to end the use of children in armed forces or groups around the world. The new accord in Chad is seen as an important step toward putting the principles into practice. \n\u201cIt was a strong demonstration of will on the part of the Chadian Government to ensure that all children under the age of 18 will be removed from any kind of military service,\u201d Mr. Adkisson said.
