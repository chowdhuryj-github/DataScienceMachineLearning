This should work, as the\nswitch will simply act as a network fabric at that point.\n\nObviously plugging in multiple computers will not work so well, because then\nthe cable modem might start switching to another machine, or bad things\nmight happen, but you can simply then run a DHCP server on the machine that\nis getting the address from the cable modem, and go to town distributing\naddresses internally.\n\nActually, another approach is to simply get another nic card for your\ncomputer, and do it at that level.\n\nTake care,\nSina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca [mailto:speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca]\nOn Behalf Of Brent Harding\nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2007 3:43 PM\nTo: Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\nSubject: Re: fc installation?\n\nI'm sure they must've thought of a way to assign an IP address. For those of\nus who made the mistake of getting a switch instead of a router, there is no\nway to get the DHCP address the cable, DSL, or other connection provides\nunless you can from a web page in the modem.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Littlefield, Tyler\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:00 AM\nSubject: fc installation?\n\n\n> Heya list,\n> I've got a quick question;\n> I've got an fc6 install disk here.\n> Do I need all I think it was... 6?\n> Also, I seen in the docs where I could type linux text telnet.\n> Can I specify an IP address to? or does it just assign a random IP from \n> the dhcp server.\n> Thanks,\n> Thanks,\n> ~~TheCreator~~\n> [My programs don't have bugs; just randomly added features]\n> msn:\n> compgeek13@gmail.com\n> aim: st8amnd2005\n> skype: st8amnd127\n> vertigo head coder\n> web: tysdomain.com\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n> \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
