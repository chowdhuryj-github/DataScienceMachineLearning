Initial value for x is 0.0207. I am\nusing the following codes, but it does not work.\n\nfr <- function(x) {\n      x1<-qnorm(0.7,0.0032,x)\n      x2=0.01\n      x1-x2\n}\nxsd <- optim(0.0207, fr, NULL,method=\"BFGS\")\n\nIt is the first time I am trying to use optimization. Could anyone give me\nsome advice?\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Optimization-tf3941212.html#a11178663\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
