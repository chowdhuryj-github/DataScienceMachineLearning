Lenny Desktop wishlist thread", "body": "Hi list,\n\nFirst thanks everybody who contributed to Debian Etch Desktop. There's\nno doubt that we've raised the bar with this release and of course the\nexpectations for Lenny.\n\nLenny general release goals and schedule is (in a way) being discussed\nat debian-release. Keep an eye on that. I'm opening this thread to\npoint out my wishlist in terms of desktop wearing my debian-desktop;\npkg-gnome and tasksel hats. Feedback is needed. ;-)\n\n* Debian Desktop is the sum of important parts: d-i, debian-cd,\ntasksel, pkg-gnome, pkg-kde and pkg-xfce were directly or indirectly\ninvolved during the Etch development cycle. I would like to see\npkg-ltsp, XSF and debian live also join us, you will see the reasons\nbelow;\n\n* Xorg \"autoconfiguration\": Hopefully it will be into the next\nupstream release and since Lenny will be released in something like 18\nmonths, we won't need to work hard to push it into.\n\n* Automount known partitions: People dual booting complained to me\nthat after installing Debian on their desktops/laptops their previous\nsystems weren't mounted.\n\n* preseeding for the win on key stuff: We need to work on grub\npreseeding definitely to at least push the desktop to use stuff like\nsplashy/usplash and maybe an init replacement like upstart. Keep in\nmind that with preseeding support into grub we can do it in a way that\n'regular' installs won't be affected, but only fresh Lenny desktop\ninstalls.\n\n* cliparts: OpenClipart should be added into the desktop tasks\n\n* debian-moreblue update contest: I would like to setup a contest to a\ndebian-moreblue update. We don't need something 200% new, but just\npeople that wants to tweak the theme for Lenny. (btw, thanks Andre for\nthe work to Etch)\n\n* live! There are live desktop images, but they're not official and\ndon't really match the desktop tasks.\n\n* ltsp: We need to work to make sure that the installer will contain a\npolished ltsp-client-builder udeb and the user will be able to select\n\"desktop environment\" and \"thin(fat, whatever) client server\" and end\nwith a system able to provide our desktop environment for these\nclients. This is harder than you think due to dhcp and nfs servers\nlack of preseeding support. Shame on me, since I'm one of the pkg-ltsp\nfounders. I'll do my best to prepare patches and send them atached to\nthe bug reports.\n\n* menu system: The Debian menu system needs to be reviewed for both\nGNOME, KDE, Xfce usage and what to do to not break others WMs.\n\n* website and wiki: I need help with wiki articles general cleanup and\nwebsite maintenance. The website needs to contain more general\ninformation on how to download and use Debian Desktop, Etch\nscreenshots (GNOME, KDE and Xfce in action). The wiki should be our\ndashboard and contains our todo, wishlists and some more stuff that\ncan be english-only.\n\nWell, that's it. The rest is basically make sure we're in sync with\nthe last upstream release where it's possible and with less RC bugs\naround testing.\n\nregards,\n-- stratus\nhttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
