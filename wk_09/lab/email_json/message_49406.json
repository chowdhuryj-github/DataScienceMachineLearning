If I did that instead of being able to use oldconfig, I'd be\nupgrading to my own kernel build every 3 years or so. When I want to\nupgrade to a newer version, I take the .config from my existing\nversion, slap it into the new source tree, do make oldconfig, compile,\nreboot, and bingo. The only scenario where this doesn't fully work is\nwhen going from 2.2 to 2.4, and from 2.4 to 2.6. When I did that, I\nstill used oldconfig to take care of anything obvious (options marked\nas new), but I did go through both times, and verified the whole\nconfig carefully before compiling.\n\nGreg\n\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGdLxa7s9z/XlyUyARAjLHAJ9l4gi7n7g24zWen78w5dutUdA7HQCfXP5c\n2rFFUIuM8nleMsBJ76U4Xsk=\n=Kqd2\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
