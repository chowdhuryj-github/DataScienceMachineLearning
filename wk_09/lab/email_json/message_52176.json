However\nI am failing a dependency for  \"libpng12.so.0\" straight away\n\n\n\n    PC5-140:/home/rmgzshd # rpm -i R-base-2.5.0-2.1.x86_64.rpm\n    error: Failed dependencies:\n    libpng12.so.0(PNG12_0)(64bit) is needed by R-base-2.5.0-2.1.x86_64\n\nI do seem to have this file\n\n    PC5-140:/home/rmgzshd # whereis libpng12.so.0\n    libpng12.so: /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libpng12.so \n\nbut presuming that it is not the 64bit version mentioned I went looking\nfor a 64 bit version but could not find it through google.\n\nHowever reading the Installation manual I noted that libpng is mention\nin the context of a source build. I therefore downloaded \"libpng-1.2.18\"\n(v-1.2.8 or later is specified in the manual) and succesfully compiled\nthis. This did not however help with my problem.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks\nStephen Henderson\n \n\n**********************************************************************\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidentia...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
