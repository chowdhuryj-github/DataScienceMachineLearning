There is no point in getting into which product is\nbetter. As far as the FDA rules are concerned a validated system beats a\n\"better\" system any day of the week.\n\nHere is your polite answer.\nYou can develop and try your software in R.\nShould they need to use those results in a report that will matter to\nthe FDA, then you can work together with him to set up a validated\nenvironment for S-plus. You then have to commit to port your code to\nS-plus.\n\nAs I assume that you do not work in a regulated environment, you\nprobably wouldn't have access to a validated SAS environment anyways. It\nis not usually enough to install a piece of software, you have to\nvalidate every step of the installation. Since AFAIK the FDA uses\nS-plus, it would be to your pharma person's advantage to speed-up\nsubmissions if they also had a validated S-plus environment.\n\nhttp://www.msmiami.com/custom/downloads/S-PLUSValidationdatasheet_Final.\npdf\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Wensui Liu\nSent: Friday, June 08, 2007 9:24 AM\nTo: Giovanni Parrinello\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] \"R is not a validated software package..\"\n\nI like to know the answer as well.\nTo be honest, I really have hard time to understand the mentality of\nclinical trial guys and rather believe it is something related to job\nsecurity.\n\nOn 6/8/07, Giovanni Parrinello  wrote:\n> Dear All,\n> discussing with a statistician of a pharmaceutical company I received\n> this answer about the statistical package that I have planned to use:\n>\n> As R is not a validated software package, we would like to ask if it\n> would rather be possible for you to use SAS, SPSS or another approved\n> statistical software system.\n>\n> Could someone suggest me a 'polite' answer?\n> TIA\n> Giovanni\n>\n> --\n> dr.
