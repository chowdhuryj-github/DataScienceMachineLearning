Any help would be greatly  \nappreciated.\n\nI have a model with a three-level factor and a continuous covariate.  \nThe call I use is:\n\nmymodel <- glm(Response ~ Factor_covariate + continuous_covariate -  \n1, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nI would like to generate predicted values for a given level of the  \ncovariate, and a given level of the factor. For instance, I want it  \nto give me a fitted value for the response at factor level 1 and  \ncontinuous covariate value 10. How would I go about expressing this?  \nI tried to look at the package Design, and specifically, at the  \ncommand \"predict.lrt\". But I was unable to quite understand how I  \nought to enter my x-values.  Again, any help would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!\n\nCheers,\n\nManasi\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
