Despite initial forecasts calling for possible thunderstorms today, NASA officials said good weather was expected all morning.\n\nAtlantis originally was scheduled for launch March 15, but insulation near the top of the ship's external fuel tank was damaged during a freak hail storm Feb. 26. The tank has now been repaired, with the lighter color foam insulation used to fill in thousands of pits and gouges clearly visible in NASA television shots today.\n\nRollout had been planned for Wednesday, but engineers completed preparations in time to move the trip up one day. NASA now has four days of contingency time left in the schedule to handle unexpected problems.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
