I just find out what they are and exploit them.\n\n\nSeparation penetrates the disappearing person like a pigment and steeps him in gentle radiance.\n\nTrue love means two seeds grow separately until they join in Matrimony forever.\n\nThe role of the intelligence --that part of us which affirms and denies and formulates opinions is merely to submit.\n\nA true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down.\n\nThe worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones.\n\nMany a man who thinks to found a home discovers that he has merely opened a tavern for his friends.\n\nWords are easy, like the wind Faithful friends are hard to find.\n\nTyrants have not yet discovered any chains that can fetter the mind.\n\nTo waken interest and kindle enthusiasm is the sure way to teach easily and successfully.\n\nThe books that everybody admires are those that nobody reads.\n\nMartyrdom is the only way a man can become famous without ability.\n\nOne who lacks courage to start has already finished\n\n\n"}
