This array is\na series of power output from a wind turbine in kW.  The rows correspond to\nwind speed from 0 to 50 m/s in 0.01 m/s step increments.  The columns\ncorrespond to the air density values from 0.90 to 1.30 kg/m3 in 0.01 kg/m3\nstep increments.  I have a vector of wind speed and air density observations\n(typically 8760 records for a year).  Given the wind speed and air density,\nI want to select the proper wind turbine power output.  I've been trying to\nfigure this out, but am having a major brain fart.  I can do this in a for (\ni in 1 : N  ) { } loop, but that is very, very inefficient.  Can anyone\nsuggest a simple, efficient way to do this in R?  Thanks.\n\n \n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Extracting-values-from-an-array-tf3655585.html#a10212795\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
