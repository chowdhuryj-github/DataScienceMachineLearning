(2) Have you thought\nabout how large a community you need?\u00a0 If it's very small, there may\nbe too few voters to establish a meaningful baseline so there might be a\nneed to build the community first.\n\u00a0\nWhat is the community in this case?\u00a0 Well that could take many forms\ndepending on the media and/or mode of distribution.\u00a0 In the music\nindustry, diehard fans could determine, through some type of ranking\nsystem, how each artist should be paid out.\u00a0 If, however, asking the\npublic to audit contribution becomes too overwhelming, there could be a\npool of editors that get paid to make these assessments.\u00a0\u00a0 This\nsystem of editors, however, would have to be anonymous in a sense, to\navoid the possibility of bribery or kickbacks.\u00a0 An additional\nsafeguarding mechanism could be utilized were the editors in turn rank\neach other.\u00a0 Editors that show an unusual high level of bias would\nbe flagged by the community of editors and thus facilitate a higher level\nof consistency.\nOverall, this idea sounds quite useful.\u00a0 A good reputation system\ncan be used to \"rate the rater\" and help ensure integrity in\nthe review process.\nThis \"information revelation\" mechanism looks like it should\nrequire a subsidy i.e. some means of compensating the raters for their\ntime and effort.\u00a0 If done well, it could be covered out of the\nrevenues generated by the pool of derivative works themselves.\nAnother form of information disclosure mechanism could be to have people\nwho actually download the derivative work themselves state what % of\nvalue the new piece adds.\u00a0 This is harder to \"fake\" since\nsomeone must actually pay for the good (so if you're going to stuff a\nballot box it's going to be costly).\u00a0 It's also unbiased because the\nperson doing the buying is not independent of the person doing the\nrating.\n\u00a0\nAlthough I\u2019m sure there\u2019s ways to establish a fair assessment of value,\nthis licensing system would require a transparency in accounting as\nwell\u00adsuch that contributors would be assured that all the revenue is\naccounted for.\u00a0 Transparent accounting might be a tall order, but if\nartists demand it, producers will find a way too oblige.\u00a0\n\nThis is also an excellent point.\u00a0 It has long been an established\ntenet of economics that more complete information leads to greater\nefficiency in production.\u00a0 Such a system should be as transparent as\npossible.\nNote also that it should also align incentives the right way e.g. no one\nshould have a reason to misrepresent their rating, and the raters' votes\nshould correspond closely to the consumers' reasons for buying.\n\u00a0\nAnyways, Just a little food for thought.\u00a0 Let me know if there\u2019s any\nmajor hurdles I\u2019m not considering in implementing a system like this\u2026\njust thinking out loud here.\nPersonally, I think the questions you raise are very interesting.\u00a0\nPlenty of thought munchies here! :-)\n\u00a0\nIs there any current discussion out there that addresses this idea?\u00a0\nI could not find any. If you could forward, I\u2019d be much appreciative.\n\nThere is some good discussion on the Free Software Business (fsb)\ndiscussion group but aside from that, I've found very little on this\ntopic.\u00a0 Thanks for raising some interesting issues.\nMVA\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n_______________________________________________\nCc-bizcom mailing list\nCc-bizcom@lists.ibiblio.org\n\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-bizcom\n\n\n"}
