You, as a human*, may use the\nDevice Manager program to do things, but that does not mean it is the\nbest way for a program to do those same things.  It may turn out to be\ncomparable to asking \"Is there a module that can control Explorer\"\nwhen all you want to do is delete a file (the unlink function by the\nway).\n\n* this is an assumption, but I think it is valid one since I don't\nthink an AI would use MS Windows.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
