My graphs are small, but not very small, having from 8 \nto 11 members (actually military units tested four points in time from \ntheir formation as strangers and with the last data collection two \nmonths later.\n> \n> Btw. what is exactly you want to do?

What is a semi-cycle?\n\nConsider a directed and signed graph having three points (also called \nvertices) with all possible relations (called lines or arcs) present \n(which does not have to be the case in empirical situations).  In that \ncase there are six possible semicycles, unique sequences of single \nlines or arcs between the three points.  The sign of a semicycle is \nthe product of the signs of the arcs, a positive semicycle has none or \nan even number of negative arcs. (e.g. John dislikes James as well as \nPeter, but Peter likes James, a balanced triad).\n\nA structural balance index is the number of positive semicycles over \nthe total number of semicycles.  This concept was introduced by:\n\n@ARTICLE{Cartwright56,\n   author = {Cartwright, Dorwin and Harary, Frank},\n   title = {Structural Balance: A Generalization of {H}eider's Theory},\n   journal = {Psychological Review},\n   year = {1956},\n   volume = {63},\n   pages = {277-293}\n}\n\nand:\n\n@BOOK{Harary65,\n   title = {Structural {M}odels: {A}n {I}ntroduction to the {T}heory \nof {D}irected {G}raphs},\n   publisher = {John Wiley \\& Sons Inc},\n   year = {1965},\n   author = {Harary, Frank and Norman, Robert Z. and Cartwright, Dorwin},\n   keywords = {Graph theory, balance},\n   address={New York}\n}\n\nto use the BibTex format.
