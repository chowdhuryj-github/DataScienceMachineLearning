Because the latter ones are highly subjective terms\nand hard even impossible to evaluate them since everybody hasdifferent taste. While unity and coherence of the desktop can beevaluated with objective terms.Artists should be encouraged to develop entire sets rather than\nindividual pieces (wallpaper, splash and so on). This way unity andcoherence can be better maintained. When pick different pieces ofartworks and match them up later like a puzzle that always result badpatchwork. A coherent but less artistic desktop always better than the\nprofessional patchwork.Yes... It will be need in artwork contest. For example, for Lenny default artwork...\nI am suggesting wallpapers without logo like ubuntu wallpapers. Thereason is because wide screen monitors can badly distort the logo asthey stretch the artwork, and a distorted logo looks veryunprofessional. This is a problem even with dedicated wide-screen\nwallpapers because most novice users just don't bother changing them.The idea is to add the debian swirl in .svg format, after the contest.Thanks!\nRegards,Jmak--http://jozmak.blogspot.com/http://jozmak.googlepages.com/\n-- Andre Luiz Rodrigues Ferreira (si0ux) <andrelrf@gmail.com> *******************************************************************Orlandia - SP - Brazil\n\"Unix is user friendly...
