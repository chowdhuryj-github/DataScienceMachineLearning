So\nupgrading it may help you avoid other problems, but...\n\nMore spaghetti: Any chance of trying Heimdal Kerberos?\n\nWhen I ran into this problem, only Windows Kerberos was in play. So\nchances are good it has nothing to do with Kerberos at all.\n\nYou might also try enabling NetLogon debugging on the windows side and\nthen playing around with ntlmauth to see if any clues come up in the\nwindows log files\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/109626\n\nRunning out of ideas fast...\n\nDave\n\n\n"}
