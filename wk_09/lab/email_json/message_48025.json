How do I fix\n\n  Do you have something called 'T':\n\n > T=c(1,2,3,4)\n > mean(x,na.rm=T)\n[1] 2\nWarning message:\nthe condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used in: \nif (na.rm) x <- x[!is.na(x)]\n\n  You should always use 'TRUE' for true and 'FALSE' for false. R makes \nit harder to shoot yourself in the foot that way:\n\n > TRUE=c(1,2,3)\nError in TRUE = c(1, 2, 3) : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment\n\nhelp(TRUE) helps:\n\nDetails:\n\n      'TRUE' and 'FALSE' are part of the R language, where 'T' and 'F'\n      are global variables set to these. All four are 'logical(1)'\n      vectors.\n\nBarry\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
