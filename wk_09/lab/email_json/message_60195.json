Where does it say that the ALNs have to be \ncompulsorily presented to the user at each run, or even once? The \nability to display them merely has to be \"convenient and prominently \nvisible\".\n\nHow can having the equivalent of a Help | About menu item ever be a cost \nto functionality?\n\nOne of the good things about the GPLv3 version of this requirement is \nthat you do not have to preserve the _mechanism_ for displaying ALNs. If \nyou acquire some software with a GUI interface where the ALNs are \npresented as the background image to the main GUI window, then you can \nswitch them to Help | About without any problems. The text focuses on \npolicy, not mechanism.\n\n> While for GUI apps having an \"About\" menu\n> item is usually not an issue, legal notices are a significant burden for\n> console stuff, both full-screen and line-based.  \n\nHow so?\n\n> And just think about\n> software which communicates using voice (hands-free things, for example).\n\nWhy does voice-communicating software have any further problems? The \nALNs can be read out at the user's request.\n\nGerv\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
