And what is preventing you from doing that?\nSave off each pop() or shift(), and then put it onto an array in\nwhatever order you like.  Could you explain what part of this is\ngiving you difficulties?\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
