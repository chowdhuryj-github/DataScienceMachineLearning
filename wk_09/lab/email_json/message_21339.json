I would like to\ntest whether an interaction can be dropped by comparing the log-likelihoods\nfrom two models(the model with the interaction vs. the model without). \nSince R does not immediately print the log-likelihood when I use the \"glm\"\nfunction, I used SAS initially.  After searching for an extracting function,\nI found one in R.  But, the log-likelihood given by SAS is different from\nthe one given by R.  I'm not sure if the \"logLik\" function in R is giving me\nsomething I don't want.  Or if I'm misinterpreting the SAS output.  Can\nanyone help?\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Log-likelihood-function-tf3678882.html#a10280717\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
