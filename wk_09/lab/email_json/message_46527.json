By comparing and\ncontrasting imagery captured over time, researchers can produce hard\nevidence to present to a hard-to-please international community.\n\"Tonight, [Amnesty Researcher Jeremy] Nelson begins his work by making a\ncopy of the [older] shot in the right-hand screen and pasting it directly\nover the [newer] one on the left.

Sudanese huts tend to follow a similar pattern: a solid base\nring with a steep, thatched roof.

'Liquid lenses bend light using the curved boundary between watery\nand oily liquids. When the two liquids are held in the right container,\nthe boundary between them can be made to curve in a way that focuses\nlight simply by applying a voltage. Liquid lenses have attracted much\nattention because they are potentially smaller than conventional optics\nand cheaper to build.
