Our configuration has map acl inherit and inherit ACLs enabled.\nWhen we set a group ACE (group contains around 150 \nusers) to the parent folder - the whole process is taking lot\nof time which is understandable, but the Vm resident memory\nof winbindd is growing to as much as 2.5 Gbytes with in half\nhour to one hour and there does not seem to be any stopping.\n\n-  Has any one run into a similar situation? \n-  Are there any possible suspects pieces or part of\n   the code which I need to be looking in detail?\n\nThanks for your help,\nSenthil\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Ready for the edge of your seat? \nCheck out tonight's top picks on Yahoo!
