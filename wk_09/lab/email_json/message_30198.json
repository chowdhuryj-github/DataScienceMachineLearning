Use \"undef\"\n               to disable inplace editing.  (Mnemonic: value of -i switch.)\n\nfrom perldoc perlrun\n       -i[extension]\n            specifies that files processed by the \"<>\" construct are to be\n            edited in-place.  It does this by renaming the input file, opening\n            the output file by the original name, and selecting that output\n            file as the default for print() statements.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
