Officials haven\u2019t yet put together a full picture of\n  Cho, saying only that \u201che was a loner.\u201d But there are some clues\n  that might shed light on his motivation, and we\u2019ll share those with\n  you.\n\u00a0\nThe identities of the victims are still being\n  released, but it is already clear that Cho\u2019s bullets cut across a diverse\n  swatch of the campus population. The dead range from bright college freshmen\n  to a 76-year-old internationally renowned engineering professor. Cynthia Bowers\n  will bring you portraits of those murdered.\n\u00a0\nAlso, Sharyn Alfonsi will report on what happened in\n  the critical two hours when Cho eluded police.\n\u00a0\nThalia Assuras will chronicle the grieving process\n  on campus.\n\u00a0\nAnd our technology correspondent, Daniel Sieberg,\n  will take a look at social networking online in the wake of the tragedy.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us tonight, and be sure to\n  tune in at 10 p.m. EST to a special edition of 48 Hours this evening called\n  \u201cAnatomy of a Rampage.\u201d \n\u00a0\nThanks,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
