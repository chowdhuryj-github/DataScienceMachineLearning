I am \nworking with xml files that contain labels marking the text inside them. I \nneed to find for each of this lines labels that are the same and mix its \ncontents up.\n\nFor instance: \n\nCONTENT1>CONTENT2>CONTENT3\nCONTENT4\n\ni don't  know how to iterate over the line matching and mixing  up their \ncontents if dont' use index and substring string functions inside a while \nloop, but this is much complicated.\n\n)'m sure Perl has another simpler way to do ti, but can't figure out how. Any \nsuggestions?\n\n-- \nXavier Mas\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
