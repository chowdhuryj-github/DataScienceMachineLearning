You can access the\nPPM by typing 'ppm' in the cmd or find the link in the Start->All\nPrograms Menu->ActivePerl.  Once the PPM window appears, just search\nfor the module you're looking for. Replace the :: in Module names with\n- e.g. Net::FTP becomes Net-FTP.\n\nDean\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
