Then have the function compute the t test\n(or other test that you plan to do) and return the p-value from the\ntest.\n\nThen you can simulate the process with a command like:\n\n> out1 <- replicate( 1000, myfunction(n=25, err=.1, diff=.5) )\n\nAnd compute the power with:\n\n> mean( out1 < 0.05 ) # or whatever alpha value you want.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
