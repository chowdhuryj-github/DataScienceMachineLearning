From simulation studies I have heard seminar talks about, it \nmakes a large practical difference as well.\n\nWithou knowing why Anna-Maria wants to 'compare two models', I could not \nbegin to offer advice.  Generally one should test how well each does the \ntask to hand, whatever that is.\n\n> On 07/06/07, Anna-Maria Tyriseva  wrote:\n>> Dear list members!\n>>\n>> Could you help me?\n>> I would like to compare two models: a) logistic regression model, 3\n>> factors as independents b) logistic regression model, 3 factors and one\n>> random effect as independents (function glmmPQL).
