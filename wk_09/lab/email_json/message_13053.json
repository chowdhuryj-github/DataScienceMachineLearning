[1]Hans V wrote, \"My kids work at Wal-Mart and the\nmanager there has been talking about this. HD-DVD's are selling like mad\nthere so I hear.\" Another reader sent us a few links in Chinese and\nsummarized them this way: \"The first batches of these blue-laser HD DVD\nplayers are to land sometime in 2007, with complete fulfillment of the\norder [from Fuh Yuan] in 2008. The deal could be worth up to $300 million\nUS, which translates to $150 per player. If so, by the time Christmas\n2007 rolls around, Wal-Mart could be selling these for less than $200\nretail, although some speculate that the initial manufacturer suggested\nretail pricing might be in the ballpark of $299. Currently the cheapest\nhigh-definition player is a Toshiba HD DVD with an MSRP of $399.\" By\ncomparison Blu-Ray players, manufactured in Japan, are not expected to\ndrop below $1000 until next year. The International Herald Tribune writes\nabout the [2]risk Toshiba is taking by bringing in Chinese manufacturers\nto trump Sony in the format war.\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/22/0035238\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/wal+mart-makes-the-push-for-299-hd-dvd-machines-253950.php\n    1. mailto:hansvadm@shaw.ca\n    2. http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/20/business/dvd.php\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Safeguards For RIAA Hard Drive Inspection                          |\n|   from the under-watchful-eyes dept.                               |\n|   posted by kdawson on Saturday April 21, @23:54 (Music)           |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/22/0045222          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes \"In [1]SONY v.
