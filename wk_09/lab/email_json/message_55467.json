That is, I understand that, ceteris  \nparibus, experiments using measure with more error (lower  \nreliability) will have lower power.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Lawrence\nGraduate Student, Department of Psychology, Dalhousie University\n\nWebsite: http://memetic.ca\n\nPublic calendar: http://icalx.com/public/informavore/Public\n\n\"The road to wisdom?
