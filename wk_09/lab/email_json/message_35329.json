More\ngenerally, I've heard that there are packages for Gentoo.  What other\npackaging should we be working on?\n\nCheers,\nDavid.\n-- \nDavid Fetter  http://fetter.org/\nphone: +1 415 235 3778        AIM: dfetter666\n                              Skype: davidfetter\n\nRemember to vote!\nConsider donating to PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/about/donate\n\n"}
