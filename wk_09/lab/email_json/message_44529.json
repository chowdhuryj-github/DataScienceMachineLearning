I want to calculate power  \nof logistic regression using likelihood ratio test in unmatched case  \ncontrol design. The paper I have read is \"power calculations for  \nlikelihood ratio tests in generalized linear models\" by Steven G.  \nSelf in 1992. They showed a formula for calculating power for  \nprospective cohort design. Can I plug in the various parameters from  \ncase control study? That is, can I pretend that the case control data  \nI have is a prospective cohort study? I guess I can do this since in  \nprincipal logistic regression is valid for both case control and  \ncohort design in estimating odds ratio.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
