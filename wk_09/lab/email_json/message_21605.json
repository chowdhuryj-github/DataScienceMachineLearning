Use summary() on your glm() object to get a fuller display of \npost-fit statistics, including the starting (\"null\") and residual deviances.\n\n2. The \"deviance\" is - 2 L, where L = ln(likelihood).\n\n3. To test two nested models for the difference in covariates, \nsubtract the two residual deviances and two d.f. and perform a \nchi-square test. This can be done nicely by anova() on the two glm() objects.\n\n4. Check the coefficients in your SAS and R models and make sure you \nare performing the same fit in both cases.\n\n================================================================\nRobert A.
