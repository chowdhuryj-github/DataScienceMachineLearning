To diagnose that, we need a\nlog.  So log in as root.  Then let X die and try to restart.  When it\ndies again, quickly type 'init 3' at the root shell to stop X.\n\nThen grab /var/log/Xorg.0.log and attach that to a bug report in trac on\ndev.laptop.org.\n\nDan\n\n\n> I also repeatedly get a message that\n> \n> Id \"3\" respawning too fast; disabled for 5 minutes\n> \n> Any advice would be much appreciated.\n> \n> Michael Tobis\n> _______________________________________________\n> Sugar mailing list\n> Sugar@laptop.org\n> http://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
