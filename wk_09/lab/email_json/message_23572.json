I have both a TP570 and a TP600\nand I never managed to get the sound to work (or the modem, though\nthat is already irrelevant), and the USB and PCMCIA ports only work\nfor some things (no wifi card I tried can work for example).\n\nI simply cannot take the time needed to research each issue -- it\nusually needs a couple of days at least, and even then not always\nleading to success.  There really should be a place to get (even\nbuy) a CD or DVD for each model that someone has made work to add\nthe necessary changs to a standard install.  This usually means\nrecompiled kernels, special drivers, tailoring hotplug and\nhibernation systems -- all stuff I scarsely understand.\n\nBut any hints on the sound that do not entail more than a couple\nof hours of work or any recompiled kernel would be welcome.\n\nFWIW, I have the same audio problem on Dell and on Acer Aspire 1640Z.\n-- \nrichard\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
