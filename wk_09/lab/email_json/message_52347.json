In parts this project focusses the \nsame aims as the GnuEdu project (http://gnuedu.ofset.org) - maybe a \ncooperation makes sense.\n\nFollowing a very wide/international approach, this project and its \nselfplatform.org could develop quite dynamically - once it is known \nwell enough and manages to gather an international community. Events \nlike the one in Bulgaria are quite important to this, I think.\n\nRegards\nRalf\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
