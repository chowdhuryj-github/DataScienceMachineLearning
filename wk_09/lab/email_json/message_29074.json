I had\ncreated a .tgz of the bundle and the wiki gave me a warning at the\nupload screen about the .tgz extension not being valid for an image\n(even when I clicked the \"ignore warnings\" button).\n\nWhat's the procedure for uploading an activity bundle?  Is .tgz the\npreferred format, or is there another extension?  I couldn't see\nanything on the wiki about this.\n\nThanks,\nJonathan\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
