Non-distributable means you\nwould infringe someone's copyright if you ever distributed the work.\nThere are those software which are distributable (in the sense that, in\nsome conditions, you could distribute it), but those conditions are not\nappropriate for distributing in Debian (even in non-free). For example,\nif Debian had to pay a fee for each copy made by a user.\n\nThe solution here would be to ask the MIDI author to distribute it under\nanother license.\n\nIANADD,\nThadeu Cascardo.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
