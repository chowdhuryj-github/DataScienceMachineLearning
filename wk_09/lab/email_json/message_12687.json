Since it's curved I'm assuming they're doing something like \nfitting 2-D Gaussians to the groups and plotting the contour line \ndescribing the intersection. I'd like to understand the general ideas \nbehind this as I need a short description for a paper I'm writing. It's \nbiosciences so I'm after concepts rather than many equations.\n\nThanks!\n\nRob\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
