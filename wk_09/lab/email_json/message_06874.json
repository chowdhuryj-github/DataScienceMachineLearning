Checking the r-announce \narchives shows that 2.0.0 came out in October 2004 and 1.9.1 in June 2004.\n\nDescribing 1.9.1 as \"the latest version\" was inaccurate, but it may well \nhave been a more recent version than for most of the  other packages they \nexamined.\n\n \t-thomas\n\nThomas Lumley\t\t\tAssoc.
