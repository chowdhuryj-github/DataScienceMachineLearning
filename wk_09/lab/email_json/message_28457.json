Ben Klemens (2006) Math you can't use (Brookings) cites cases \nwhere people have been successfully sued for copyright infringement for \nusing a theorem they independently discovered.  That's pretty scary to \nme and seems totally unreasonable, but apparently the law at least in \nthe US.\n\n\t  Spencer Graves\n\n########################\n      Brian's reply seems more consistent with what I've heard than\nPeter's.\n\n      The briefest summary I know of copyright law is that expression\nbut not ideas can be copyrighted.  Copyright law exists to promote\nuseful arts, and a compilation of data is intended to be useful.\nGoogle, led me to \"http://ahds.ac.uk/copyrightfaq.htm#faq1?\", says that\n\"data or other materials which (a) are arranged in a systematic or\nmethodical way, or (b) are individually accessible by electronic or\nother means\" can be copyrighted.\n\n      Beyond that, there is a \"fair use\" doctrine, which in the US at\nleast allows use in many cases by educators in public institutions, but\nthe same use by someone not affiliated with a public school might be an\ninfringement.  Ten years ago, I heard from attorneys at the University\nof Wisconsin that a college prof can run copies of a journal article and\ndistribute them to this class without worrying about copyright\ninfringement (provided any money collected is clearly designed to cover\ncosts not make a profit), but the same copies prepared by Kinko's off\ncampus for the same class (sold perhaps at the same price) must get\ncopyright permission.\n\n      Hope this helps.\n      Spencer Graves\n\nPeter Dalgaard wrote:\n> hadley wickham wrote:\n>   \n>> Dear all,\n>>\n>> This is a little bit off-topic, but I was wondering if anyone has any\n>> informed opinion on whether data (ie. a dataset) is copyrightable?\n>>\n>> Hadley\n>>   \n>>     \n> In general not, I believe.
