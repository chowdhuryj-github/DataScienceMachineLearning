So even though it looked like it \nwas on a new line, it wasn't. It wasn't a line wrap issue, these were \nactually returns that I had hit that just weren't registering. I had one \nchunk of code which showed what I thought was the problem when R \ncrashed. When I opened up the script again after restarting, the problem \ndisappeared, so somehow the returns started to be seen.\n\nthanks for your help.\n\nIvan\n\n\n\n\n>\n>>\n>> ...[multiple loops and calculations ending with.....]...\n>>\n>> +             print(paste(mutType,\"sim\",sim,\"hmm\",hmm))      \n>> +             # print(acctab[,10:15])\n>> +                +             nummod <- nummod +1\n>> +         }  #end hmmMats loop\n>> +         }  #end tmats loop   +         }  #end mut type loop\n>> [1] \"dup sim Imod hmm Jmod\"\n>>\n>>  > print(acctab[,10:15])\n>>     hitrate falsepos   multrate      avghit avgmiss avgfalsepos\n>> 1 0.0000000        1        NaN         NaN       2          NA\n>> 2 1.0000000        0 0.00000000    5.333333     NaN          NA\n>> 3 0.0000000      NaN        NaN         NaN       9          NA\n>> 4 0.7777778        0 0.00000000   15.571429      11          NA\n>> 5 1.0000000        0 0.00000000   24.083333     NaN          NA\n>> 6 1.0000000        0 0.07692308   64.538462     NaN          NA\n>> 7 1.0000000        0 0.39207048 1088.454846     NaN          NA\n>>\n>> you can see that\n>> a) the print statement above it works\n>> b) the print command works with this table\n>>\n>> but if I uncomment it and try to run the loops again.....\n>>\n>> +             print(paste(mutType,\"sim\",sim,\"hmm\",hmm))         \n>>               print(acctab[,10:15])\n>> Error: syntax error\n>>  >         >                 >             nummod <- nummod +1\n>>  >         }  #end hmmMats loop\n>> Error: syntax error\n>>  >         }  #end tmats loop   Error: syntax error\n>>  >         }  #end mut type loop\n>> Error: syntax error\n>>\n>>\n>> I have tried print.data.frame, but that doesn't work either....\n>>\n>>\n>> Any suggestions would be appreciated  (session info below)\n>>\n>>\n>> Ivan\n>>\n>>\n>>  > sessionInfo()\n>> R version 2.5.1 (2007-06-27)\n>> i386-apple-darwin8.9.1\n>>\n>> locale:\n>> C\n>>\n>> attached base packages:\n>> [1] \"stats\"     \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"utils\"     \"datasets\"  \n>> \"methods\"   \"base\" \n>\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\nIvan Baxter\nResearch Scientist\nBindley Bioscience Center\nPurdue University\nOffice: Hort 305\n765-543-7288\nibaxter@purdue.edu\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
