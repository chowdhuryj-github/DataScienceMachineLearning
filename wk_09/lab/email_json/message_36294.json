It is called an MRAP for short, and\n  its ability to withstand powerful blasts from roadside bombs is already\n  renowned. Naturally, the demand for the vehicle is great among troops in the\n  field. But the Marine Corps says because of bureaucratic red tape\n  they\u2019ve received less than one-tenth of the vehicles they\u2019ve\n  ordered. How long will it take for American soldiers in Iraq to get the protection\n  they\u2019re pleading for? David Martin will report.\n\u00a0\nIn Washington,\n  the battle over the war heated up. Sen.

Jim Axelrod will have the\n  details. \n\u00a0\nPacking up and getting out: that\u2019s what tens\n  of millions of Americans are doing for this Memorial Day weekend. It\u2019s\n  the unofficial start of summer, and an estimated 38 million people will be\n  hitting the road and the airports. Nancy Cordes will take a look at the\n  travel crunch.\n\u00a0\nWith gas prices hitting a nationwide average of\n  $3.23 per gallon, holiday travelers \u2013 and daily commuters \u2013 are\n  reconsidering how they get around. For many, the answer is to\n  \u201cdownsize.\u201d Is America\u2019s\n  appetite for huge vehicles really diminishing? Byron Pitts will have the\n  answer. \n\u00a0\nAt the Indy 500, the cars are already small, but\n  this year they\u2019re all making an environment-friendly change, Cynthia\n  Bowers will report.\n\u00a0\nThe rescuers attempting to steer California\u2019s wayward whales in the\n  right direction to lead them out to sea have stopped with the whale calls;\n  they\u2019ve given up on banging pipes underwater. Now they\u2019re\n  bringing out the fire hoses to help. John Blackstone will explain.\n\u00a0\nFinally, the story of a boy who rescued himself.\n  Faced with a learning disability and then sudden poverty and homelessness, Daniel Lazzatti got himself to school\n  every day, worked a night job and now is graduating high school.
