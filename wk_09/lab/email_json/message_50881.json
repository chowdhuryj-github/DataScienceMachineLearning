(OTCBB:SVSN) announced \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttoday that Spie Schwartz, Creator and \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExecutive Producer of \"Baywatch\", along with \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdozens of other movies and TV shows, has been \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed Chairman of the Board with immediate \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffect. \nStereo Vision's \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChief Executive Officer, Jack Honour, stated,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"For over three years now, Spie's been \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelping to steer the Stereo Vision crew through \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe turbulent waters of the entertainment world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe're very proud to have earned the opportunity \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be working with such a consummate \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprofessional. Spie's iconic family has had \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the midst of the entertainment \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry since \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchildhood. With his father head-writing and \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloping shows with such legends as Bob \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHope, and Lucille Ball, and his uncle \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSherwood creating among others, 'Gilligan's \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsland' and 'The Brady Bunch,' at \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thome growing up, Spie was surrounded by people \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike Red Skelton and Jackie Gleason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrue to his family's heritage, Spie produced his \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst piece when he was fourteen, it was shown \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton network television, and he was featured on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Johnny Carson show -- the youngest person \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tever to do so. It's very gratifying to me, the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard and all the founding partners, to have \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated a formula that Spie so fully believes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin.\" \nChairman Schwartz \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadded, \"I have the highest confidence in the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic's interest in going out to theatres to \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsee polarized 3-D movies.
