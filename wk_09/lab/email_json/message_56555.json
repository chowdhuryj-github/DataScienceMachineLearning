He witnessed an unprecedented sending off by Blair's fellow Parliamentarians. Combat suspended - for a while at least - the former PM received warm tributes, a standing ovation, as well as many good hearted pats on the back, he even threw in some good jokes. David brings us the definitive account of the final hours of Blair's premiership. \n\n\n\"Let the work of change begin\".\n\n\nMichael Crick started his day at the Treasury and has been watching the equally compelling journey of Zombie Brown's path to Number 10.
