The component will provide a stand-alone executable, and has little dependency on other components -- basically, it's the perfect opportunity for C++ developers to get into the component game and earn some money. \n\nAnd don't forget: With the new rules for the Digital Run, placement points are tied to prize money, so this is also a great chance to earn twice the DR points of a standard Development project. \n\nLearn more and register here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&pj=30001930\n\nGood luck!\n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
