Not to detract from your good results\nbut I think that much effort was not needed.\n\nThe default installation of Etch will install NetworkManager by\ndefault.  Internally NetworkManager already uses wpa_supplicant.\nTherefore I think that if you use NM to connect that you will get\nwpa_supplicant without needing to compile and install it explicitly.\n\nIt \"just worked\" for me when I connected up to a WPA wireless node.  I\nhave always been a low-level type of guy and only recently tried using\nNM to manage these things.  But so far I am quite impressed, like it\nquite a bit, and think the relationship with NM will be a long one.\n\nBob\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
