My guess is that the R \nprocess is running at ~100% of the CPU and not returning to the top-levl \nprompt nor is it interruptible.\n\nIf so, I believe you will find it is inside the Fortran code.  (I think I \nhave seen similar examples in the past, which is why I tend not to use \ntripack, not akima which has also misbehaved.)\n\nHave you sent the problem to the package maintainer?\n\n\n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Andrew Pierce\n>> Sent: Wednesday, May 09, 2007 12:21 AM\n>> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>> Subject: [R] voronoi.mosaic chokes?\n>>\n>> Hi all,\n>>\n>> I am running R 2.5.0 under Windows XP Media Center Edition.\n>> Here's a problem that's been stumping me for a few days now,\n>> and I can't find anything useful in the archives.
