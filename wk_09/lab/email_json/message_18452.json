I was wondering if the latest \nrelease of Ubuntu Feisty or whatever the latest version of Ubuntu is for the \ndesktop system contains Speakup in it's kernel?\nAlso, though this is off topic somewhat, when I tell Speechd-up to set -t at \nbootup, where would the configuration files be on Ubuntu for Speechd-up, and\nalso: How would I set it?\nDontinittables with dash signs in between each word? Like this:\ndont-init-tables=1 (Notice the equals sign)\nOr would I set it without dash marks? (Wich syntax to use?)\nLike this:\nDontinittables=1?\nI need to know this as soon as possible.\nRegards, --Keith, KeithNet Network Administrator\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
