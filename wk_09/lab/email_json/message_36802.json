However, I don't think there is any\npossible permutation test that will provide you with a valid test of\nsignificance if the samples themselves are not independent.\n\nTyler\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
