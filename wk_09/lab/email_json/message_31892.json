Then, in my First.R, if the\n.gz file was say chron, I have something like\n\n.libPaths(\"/u/etlfs/dev/users/leedsmar/res/R/lib_new\")\n\nprint(\"LOADING CHRON LIBRARY \\n\")\nlibrary(\"chron\")\n\nThis works fine.\n\nSo, then I was going to install the lattice package but I noticed that\nif I just type library(\"lattice\") at an R prompt\nThings seem to get loaded correctly. So, my first dumb question is why\ndo I go through that whole process of R CMD INSTALL -l . gz file\n\nMaybe this is because, in my. .envfile,  my path is set as \n\nPATH=$PATH:/u/leedsmar/bin:/ms/dist/fsf/PROJ/R/2.4.0/lib/R/bin: \n\nso maybe it finds the lattice package over there when you type\nlibrary(\"whatever\") ? But my .libpaths is only set to the lib_new\ndirectory \nso I'm kind of confused because I thought .libPaths was for poiting to a\nplace where the packages were ?\n\n2) if there is a reason to still use R CMD INSTALL -l . gz file, then,\nif a package on CRAN says \"depends on 2.5.0\",\nIs it still okay to go through that R CMD INSTALL -l . process if you\nare using say R.2.4.0 or does the \"depends\" mean that the package \nwill not work.\n\n\nThanks for your patience and any insights. I'm obviously not\nunderstanding things very well and would like to change this as \nmuch as I can.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
