In... network coding, routers are replaced by coders,\nwhich transmit evidence about messages instead of sending the messages\nthemselves. When receivers collect the evidence, they deduce the original\ninformation from the assembled clues. Although this method may sound\ncounterintuitive, network coding, which is still under study, has the\npotential to dramatically speed up and improve the reliability of all\nmanner of communications systems and may well spark the next revolution\nin the field.

Despite Sun's OpenOffice.org\ndeveloper Malte Timmermann's [3]claims to the contrary, this kind of\nembedded scripting attack represents a real threat to OpenOffice.org\nusers. Back in June 2000 when Sun first announced the open sourcing of\nOpenOffice.org, the twelfth email to the open discussion list put forward\n[4]a two-part solution for providing OpenOffice users with Safe(r)\nScripting using restricted-mode execution by default and access by signed\ndigital certificates.
