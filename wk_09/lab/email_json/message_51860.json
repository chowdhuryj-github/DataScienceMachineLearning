I had a program in\nMatlab which took more than an hour to run and I had\nto run it many times, so I usually prepared a few\nruns, started them in the evening before leaving the\noffice and got the results next morning.  After a\nwhile I have re-written it in C (this took me a few\ndays) and got a spead-up factor of about 100, so that\nnow the run took just a few minutes!\nLanguages like R and Matlab are extreemely convenient\nbut if performance is a very important issue you shoul\nuse C, Fortran, C++, etc.\n\nRegards,\n\nMoshe Olshansky.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
