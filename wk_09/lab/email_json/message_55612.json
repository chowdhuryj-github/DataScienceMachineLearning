I'd expect them to forget about trying to make it quicker \nbecause they know the've failed to compete many times already and \nconcentrate on the reasons why Perl should be banned instead.\n\nJenda\n===== Jenda@Krynicky.cz === http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz =====\nWhen it comes to wine, women and song, wizards are allowed \nto get drunk and croon as much as they like.\n\t-- Terry Pratchett in Sourcery\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
