For example, could you calculate the percentage\nof people who smoke based on a dataset like the following:\n\nsmoke = 1\nnon-smoke = 2\n\nvariable\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\nWhen aggregated, SPSS can tell you what percentage of persons are smokers\nbased on the frequency of 1's and 2's. Can R statistical package do a\nsimilar thing?\n\nThanks,\n\nNat\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
