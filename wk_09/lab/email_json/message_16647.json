You live, but you don't know why; you work, but don't know the \nsense of it; you come at home, but you don't feel comfort and cold bed \nmakes you feel disgust... do you have the same unpleasant feelings and \nneed love in your life as I need?\nThe whole life is wating for me and you in future. But it is died if you are \nalone and you can't share a new day with beloved person. Do you agree \nwith me?\nIf I don't give love, if I can't share passion and romantic feelings with \nbeloved, I feel that I am dying every moment, every hour, every day.\n\nDon't let me die at all, write me, please, and just say 'hello, a stranger \nbeauty from Ukraine! yes, i want to get acquinted with you too!\" and after\nit, let me do the next step and you will see that I will change your  life\nand wave you in the cradle of my love.\nI close this letter now, but i am waiting for your reply, Dear Stranger whom \nI liked and I hope that you will like me too\nhttp://myhearthwithlove.com/likes\n\nKiss-kiss\n\nJulia K\n\n\n"}
