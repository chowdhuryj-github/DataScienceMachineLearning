I do want to pass in an array and work with all of it.\nSo if I wanted to work with only the first indices to start, is this correct:\nsub stop_it {\n        my ($vm) = @_[0];\n        my $state = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \\\"\"$vm\"\\\" getstate -q`;\n        .\n        .\n        .\n}\nBut, the system executed command needs to see \"itself\" that is, quotes around the value of $vm. Basically I need to pass the shell this:\nVmware-cmd \"/path/to/file/name.vmx\" getstate -q\nSo did I write that correct for both situations?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your next email, you say this:\nsub stop_it {\n    for my $vm (@_) {\n        my $state = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \"$vm\" getstate -q`;\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    }\n}\n\nBut I don't want to pass all indices to each section in the sub, each section does something with either one, or a specific few of the indices, later I direct for example, 2 and 3 into a loop.\n\nThanks!\njlc\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
