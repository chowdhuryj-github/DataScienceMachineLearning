An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.\n\nProcrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy.\n\nMy imagination is a monastery and I am its monk.\n\nThe upshot was, my paintings must burn that English artists might finally learn.\n\nA paranoiac, like a poet, is born, not made.\n\nNo one will do it for you.\n\n\n"}
