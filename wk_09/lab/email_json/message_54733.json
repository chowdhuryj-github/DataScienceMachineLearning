(I have three categories)\nMy purpose of doing so is to check whether significant difference comes up\nin the randomized data also. This is to check the effect of the small sample\nsize of my data.\nPlease suggest a way or an alternative to the above approach.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
