I've run simh on both linux and\nwindows. \n\nUsing simh I recently installed and played with RSTS/E on a simulated\nPDP-1170. Very fun and gives you a broader perspective.\n\n--Debee\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
