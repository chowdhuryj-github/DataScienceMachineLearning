I looked at the instructions that you referenced and noticed a couple of potential problems with the instructions.  I was able to correct the set-up and successfully run the sample program from the web site.  However, I use a different set up because I prefer to send output to a file that I can then open in another Textpad window, rather than \"capturing\" the output.  Since this is not an R problem, if you contact me off-list I would be happy to give you detailed instructions on how to set up Textpad running R code in batch mode.\n\nDan\n\nDaniel Nordlund\nBothell, WA USA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
