Hi \n      everyone, The merger of Daimler and Chrysler was one of the most \n      expensive \u2013 and least fruitful \u2013 in American automaking history. Now \n      DaimlerChrysler is dropping its struggling Chrysler Group, which is \n      getting picked up for $7.4 billion by a private equity firm. Anthony \n      Mason will have the story of Chrysler\u2019s sale and Nancy Cordes \n      will look at what\u2019s pinching American automakers, from union costs to \n      pensions and sales numbers. Turning to Iraq, we\u2019ll have two \n      stories. First: the anatomy of an ambush. Mark Strassmann will \n      report on the abduction of three American soldiers in Saturday\u2019s early \n      morning hours south of Baghdad. He\u2019ll break down what happened and the \n      effort to get the missing soldiers back. And it has been reported \n      that between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels of Iraq\u2019s oil has been \n      unaccounted for \u2013 that\u2019s every day for the past four years. Our Sharyl \n      Attkisson asks why \u2013 was it corruption, smuggling or simply poor \n      accounting? Cycling great Floyd Landis opened his doping hearing \n      denying the charge. He also criticized the testing procedure used by the \n      Tour de France, Bill Whitaker will report. As for health \n      news, I\u2019ll talk with our Dr. Jon LaPook about the surprising study \n      that shows the number of women older than 40 getting mammograms is on the \n      decline. It is the first time the rate has fallen, according to the \n      National Cancer Institute. And I\u2019ll wrap-up our broadcast with the \n      first piece in a series we\u2019ve been working on called \u201cGotta Have It: \n      The Hard Sell To Kids.\u201d I\u2019ll take a look at the multitude of ways \n      cartoon characters and other faces our kids and grandkids love are used to \n      market everything from junk food to exercise.
