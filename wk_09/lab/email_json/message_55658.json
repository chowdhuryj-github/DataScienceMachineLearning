It may take some tweeking but you'll thank yourself in \nthe end.  Good experience.\nIf you plan on updating your kernel frequently, get the linux-2.6.21.tar.bz2 \nfile along with the latest patch for that kernel, like linux-2.6.21.5.patch \nand apply it.  Then, when a new patchlevel comes out, get that new patch, \nlinux-2.6.21.6.patch, unapply the patchlevel 5 patch and apply 6.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Zachary Kline\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Tuesday, June 26, 2007 2:37 AM\nSubject: Patch hunk rejection?\n\n\n> Hiya,\n>    Spie, when I tried to apply Speakup patches to the kernel 2.6.17 I \n> downloaded from Slackware, I got a couple of messages about hunk \n> rejections.
