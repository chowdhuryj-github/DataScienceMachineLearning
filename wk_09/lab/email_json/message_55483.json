So in this case it is probably\nmore advisable to add the date. The version is useful only if ti gives\nyou a way to guess where in time it has been taken. A random hash makes\nit only unique but it is not otherwise useful imo.\n\nSimo.\n\n-- \nSimo Sorce\nSamba Team GPL Compliance Officer\nemail: idra@samba.org\nhttp://samba.org\n\n"}
