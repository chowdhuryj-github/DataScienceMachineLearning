Yet, why would a utility take a risk on new technologies when they can still deliver a return to investors by maintaining the status quo? When it comes right down to it, the monetary bottom line is the only line and spending on pricey, newly-proven technologies is not always the best approach. Still, almost everyone will argue that the time has arrived for the next generation of the modern transmission grid.\nSo where is the breaking point? A new superconductor project might cost twice as much as a traditional line, but at the same time, might replace several other projects due to the high voltage load and maintenance savings over time. Utilities seem to be very interested on reaching this next level of grid reliability, but how is the market pushing reliability through technology deployment? FERC and state level regulators have called for technology adoption to improve reliability and negate congestion trouble spots, but they are still having trouble encouraging utilities to invest. Is the market creating a sustainable reliability approach or are more regulatory tools needed?\nThis day and a half EUCI conference will seek to shed light on this question of the costs and benefits of transmission technologies. Presenters will explore with attendees the key technology areas of concern, including specific, available technologies. State and federal regulators will speak to challenges in adopting regulatory tools that can encourage technology adoption. Several utilities will tell of their experience with new technology projects and several regional transmission organizations will look at items that improve reliability and electricity costs for customers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\n\nUpcoming \nConferences\n\nPower Delivery \n  Planning I: Getting The Basics Right\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Outsourcing \n  For Utilities\nChicago, IL\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Marketing \n  Green Power\nChicago, IL\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Fundamentals \n  of Distribution Engineering\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Sox-101 for \n  Electric, Gas and Water Utilities ...
