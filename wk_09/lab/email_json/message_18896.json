And Jon Stewart goes head to\nhead with McCain, but was it comedy?\n\nDC Madam\nScandal\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias\nresigned after confirming to ABC's Brian Ross that he had been\na customer of Jeanne Palfrey's D.C. escort service.  Tobias\nsays he was just getting massages, but Palfrey is currently\nunder indictment for running a prostitution ring. Should ABC be\nbroadcasting Palfrey's list of customers?\n\nWar\nStories\n\nWhen they broke, the Jessica Lynch and Pat\nTillman stories seemed like made-for TV movies, but perhaps\nthat's all they should have been.  How did the media get these\ntwo reports so wrong?  Is the wartime press falling down on the\njob?\n\nPlus, Rosie O'Donnell is leaving the\nview.  Was her departure voluntary, or had she crossed the line\nwith her vocal views?\n\nJoin us this Sunday and every\nSunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media!\n,\n\n\nRead our privacy guidelines at:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/privacy.html\nYou have agreed to receive this email from CNN.com as a result of your CNN.com preference settings.\nTo manage your settings click  here.\nTo unsubscribe from the Reliable Sources list, go to\nhttp://cgi.cnn.com/m/clik?e=ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA&l=reliablesrc\nThis message was sent to you at ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCable News Network.
