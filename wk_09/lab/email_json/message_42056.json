I have used\nRWinEdt for several years in Windows, and something similar to RWinEdt for\nMac would be ideal. I've looked into some of the emacs editor (e.g.,\nAquamacs) but I wanted to see what other people prefer, as I'm not sure I'm\nan emacs person (at this time anyway).\nThanks,\nKen\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
