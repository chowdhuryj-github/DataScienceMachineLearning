It is done through the assistant of your country man Mr.Howard Ferraro who is a London base business man. Currently I am in London with him, my wife and children.\n\nHowever, I did not forget you because you are the source of my success, you made me what I am now though you are not there to complete this project with me but I gave all the credit and thanks to you. I know it is not your fault or rather your wish to back up on me and the transaction \n,I understand it was simply because of what you must have heard about my country and her business opportunities. Actually there are still good ones for example myself.\n\nIn appreciate of your assistance I have mapped out as a compensation and wrote on your favor a Draft worth of US$2,000,000.00.(Two Million) I left the Draft with my attorney Mr. Peter Brown on my departure to London. I would like you therefore,cto contact him on the below info so \nthat he can mail it to you.\n\nWILLIAMS & MARK CHAMBERS\nAttn: MR. Peter Brown \nEmail: Peterbrown1000@laposte.net \n\nI would have love to call you from London where I currently reside but due to the recent terrorist attack Mr.Howard Ferraro advice me not to call because all internatonal calls are being monitored by the UK authority. Contact my attorney so that he can release your Draft to you. I \nwill stop here. Once again, thank you very much and remain blessed.\n\nBest Regards.\nDr. Roselyn Polly.\n\n\n\n\n"}
