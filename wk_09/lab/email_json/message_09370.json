I then need to count how often a point falls into a certain position in the matrix or grid. I have searched all day online, asked collegeas but nothing works.\n\nSadly my R \"box of tricks\" has run out.\n\nMy (point) data looks like this;\n\nx         y\n2.3    4.5\n3.4      0.2\n\nand continues for another million records. \n\nNow my question; is there any function that is able to \"count\" how often a point falls into a grid based on the x and y location? So I need to discretize the spatial locations to a regular grid and then counting how often  a point occurs.\n\nMany thanks for your thoughts on this problem.\n\nMarco Visser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
