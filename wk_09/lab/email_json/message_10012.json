The goal of most of these plans is preservation of employee well being and maintenance of reliable utility services. A successful plan will begin by developing a cohesive set of policies concerning:\n\n\nRegulatory & reporting requirements\n\nPrioritization of vaccine for critical electric company functions\n\nBusiness continuity\n\nShareholder liability\n\nHuman resources management\n\nManagement chain of command\n\nInternal and external communications\n\nSupply chain management\n\nUtility operations continuity\nThe participants on this program have experience in public health, policy making and developing and testing pandemic flu response exercises. Collaboration with peers and competitors allow benchmarks to be made which may serve as the best model for pandemic influenza preparedness.\n\n\nATTENDEES FROM THE DECEMBER 2006 PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS CONFERENCE SAID:\n\u201cGood diversity of speaker backgrounds and perspective\u201d\n          ~J.W.
