What if ther was some sort of \"scratchpad\" activity, \nnot draw, or write,or calculator but a kind fusion of all three. \nmathimatical equasions could be typed out and then they could solve with \ntyping and or drawing for their work, and they could write guides and \npicture books and such with this activity as well. Is this in \npossible/in the plans/something similar is being made???\n~Rebecca Gettys\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
