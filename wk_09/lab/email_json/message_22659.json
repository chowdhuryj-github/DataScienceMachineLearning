The only way I can think of doing this is to do an ls -l on / and\nthen doing a diff after the installation and manually adding those files to a\ntar command.\n\nWhat I'd rather do is automate this using perl.  gather a list of the files,\nperform the installation, getting a list of the new files by way of a diff or\nsome such and adding all those files to a tar command or some such.\n\nHas anyone done such a thing or know of a module I should look at to achieve this?\n\nMathew\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
