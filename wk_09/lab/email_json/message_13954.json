I'm having an odd \ndifficulty. After I type:\n\nread.csv(\"niwage.csv\", header = TRUE)\n\nthe data appears on the screen.  The last thirty or so observations appear \non the screen and they have been read in correctly.\n\nHowever, when I type:\n\ndim(data)\n\nI see:\n\nNULL\n\nThis seems odd to me--R seems to be recognizing the data but not storing \nit.  I didn't come across any mention of this in the \"R Data Import/Export \nManual\", FAQs, prior questions that I thought addressed this issue.\n\n(If this info would help: The csv file was created from a Stata file using \nthe outsheet command.  When I tried to use library(foreign) to import the \ndata directly from Stata, using:\n\nstata.data <- read.dta(\"niwage.dta\")\nload(\"niwage.RData\")\n\nI got the following:\n\nError in readChar(con, 5) : cannot open the connection In addition: \nWarning message: cannot open compressed file 'niwage.RData'\n)\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any help anyone could offer on my problem.\n\nThanks,\nBill\n\n\n**************************************************************************\nWilliam F.
