Some observations:\nA: You do realize that you are only using 1.5 chunks? (15M vs. 10e6chunksize)\nB: Deviance changes are O(1) under the null hypothesis but the deviancesthemselves are O(N). In a smaller variant (N=1e5), I got\n> m1$deviance[1] 138626.4> m2$deviance[1] 138626.4> m2$deviance - m1$deviance[1] -0.05865785\nThis does leave some scope for roundoff to creep in. You may want toplay with a lower setting of tol=...\n--    O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             \u00d8ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.
