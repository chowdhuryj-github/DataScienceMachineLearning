Please read\nthe release notes of Etch at\n\nhttp://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/index.en.html\n\nespecially section 4 \"Upgrades from previous releases\". Try to follow\nthe procedures outlined therein. Some of the things described there have\nalready happened on your system, but others have not and still need to\nbe done, for example \"Upgrading the kernel\" (sections 4.5.5 and 4.6).\n\nThe procedures are such that you can perform them all on the command\nline with aptitude; you won't need X. Once your system is properly\nupgraded X should start to work again.\n\nAlso make sure that you run \"dpkg --purge hotplug\" once you are done\nwith the upgrade. (This might already be included as a step in the\nupgrade procedure; if it is not then run it afterwards.)\n\n-- \nRegards,            | http://users.icfo.es/Florian.Kulzer\n          Florian   |\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
