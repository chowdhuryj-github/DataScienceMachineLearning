At any rate, though, I've been able to get the system up and working via SSH--not the most reliable thing in the world, but it's better than nothing.\nAny advice for how to get Speakup and friends working with it?  (I know I'll need speech-dispatcher and speechd-up, as well as espeak.)\nThanks much in advance,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
