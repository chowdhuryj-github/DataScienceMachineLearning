R 2.5.0 alpha bug", "body": "\n\nThis email is intended to highlight 2 problems that I encountered\nrunning R 2.5.0 alpha on a Windows XP machine.\n\n#1 - Open script error\n\nIf I click the \"Open folder\" icon on the toolbar, R opens my script\nfiles perfectly.  However, when I select \"File > Open Script >\nMyFileLocation\", I get a fatal error that causes R to close immediately.\nThis error was reproduced on 3 consecutive occasions but has been\nintermittent thereafter. One of these fatal errors resulted in a typical\nerror reporting box being generated which I sent off.  I was not able to\nverify if this error has been reported and corrected in subsequent\nversions of 2.5.\n\n#2 - Bug reporting link on CRAN website broken\n\nI tried to report the bug listed above on the CRAN website but when I\nclicked on the bug reporting link on the left-hand side panel of the\nmain site (http://bugs.r-project.org/cgi-bin/R) , I get an error page\nwith the following message:\n\nThe system encountered a fatal error \ncannot open config file /home/sfe/r-bugs/jitterbug/R : No such file or\ndirectory\nThe last error code was: No such file or directory \nuid/gid=30/8 \n\n\nThis has been submitted to r-devel.\n\nBrant Inman\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
