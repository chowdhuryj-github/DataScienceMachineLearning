Perhaps the code\nwill eventually be written to log-transform the data\nif it fails the normality test?\n\n [ hint: ?boxcox in the MASS package might be a better way\nto go ]\n\n  Ben Bolker\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
