It's the only one that seems to come close to working, but I\nkeep getting this error:\n\n> data<-read.dta(\"C:/Documents and\nSettings/Chris/Desktop/S4412/catestscores.dta\")\nError in read.dta(\"C:/Documents and\nSettings/Chris/Desktop/S4412/catestscores.dta\",  :\n        a binary read error occurred\n\n\nThere's little chance the data is corrupt considering it came from my\nprofessor and he used the data earlier.  So, either I'm doing something\nwrong or R just doesn't like to read in Stata files.  If it's a problem with\nR, how can I easily convert the file without purchasing Stata?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
