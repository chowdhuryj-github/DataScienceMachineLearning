Ok, let\u2019s look at...\n\nFILTER  #2.\u00a0 Extremely strong sales growth.\u00a0 Nothing less than 50% will do here\u2014and  100% is better.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 This rate of sales growth signifies  market acceptance.\u00a0 By their  nature, these are innovative companies, but we don\u2019t want the RISKS of  innovation (especially the waiting!).\n\nExample:  Apple spent $500 million on the ill-fated Newton PDA before it was pulled off  the shelves.\u00a0 That made Apple a  dangerously expensive stock at $9, which is where it languished before the iPod  era. \n\n        But when the iPod sales kicked in, we bought\u2014and  rode the stock up to $85. \n\nFILTER  #3.\u00a0 Exploding margins.\u00a0 The four stocks I\u2019ve uncovered are  currently improving operating margin at 200% dip\u2014or close.\u00a0 This means that the strong sales are  not being bought at too high a price.\n\nExample:  We were impressed with Hansen Natural soft drinks business when it was a $3  stock posting sales that were doubling.\u00a0  But the clincher was the rate at which Hansen was growing its margins in  2004-\u2014Emerging Growth subscribers have multiplied their money 10 TIMES since  then.\n\nFILTER  #4.\u00a0 The Holy Grail: earnings  growth.\u00a0 Expanding operating earnings generally  lead to earnings growth going at warp-speed.\u00a0 \nA good clue here is to track how analysts are  revising their consumers earnings estimates.\u00a0 The more they do this, and the bigger their adjustments, the  more you can be certain that the stock will pop on earnings surprise at the end  of the quarter\u2014and hand you windfall profits.\n\nExample:  Holly, the refinery, was a $12 stock with 105% sales growth and profit margins  doubling when we bought it.\u00a0  Analysts were so befuddled, they couldn\u2019t revise their earnings growth  numbers fast enough.\u00a0 That\u2019s when we  knew we had to step in.\u00a0 The  stock\u2019s up nearly 400% since.\n\nWhat They\u2019ve Done\nFor You Recently\nThese  are our 4 filters.\u00a0 How have they  worked for Emerging Growth subscribers recently?\n\n\nAcergy\nWAS  $11.66\nIS  UP 83%\n\n\nAmerica  Movil \nWAS  $11.77\nIS  UP 306%\n\n\nEZcorp\nWAS  $12.10\nIS  UP 22% \n\n\nGuess  Inc.\nWAS  $18.43\nIS  UP 120%\n\n\nHolly  Corp\nWAS  $11.90 \nIS  UP 398%\n\n\nBolt  Technology\nWAS  $14.14\nIS  UP 142%\n\n\nBoots  & Coots\nWAS  $2.21\nIS  UP 25%\n\n\nGiga  Media\nWAS  $8.21\nIS  UP 68%\n\n\nHansen  Natural \nWAS  $3.29\nIS  UP 1,051%\n\n\nNutriSystem\nWAS  $20.12\nIS  UP 160%\n\n\nSimulations  Plus\nWAS  $6.14\nIS  UP 62%\n\n\nU.S.  Global Investors\nWAS  $11.73\nIS  UP 120%\n\n\nThis list is taken from our current buy  list.\u00a0 If I listed all the  Under-$24 stock we\u2019ve made at least a double in, using these same 4 simple  criteria, it could take up 3 computer screens and exhaust your patience.\u00a0 Take it from me: Emerging Growth became the #1 advisory  for 20 years on stocks under $24 that passed these filters.      \nThe Envelope, please:\nInvest With\nThe Masters\nPentagon code-breaker  and math wizard Jim Simons earned $1.7 billion last year in fees.\u00a0 That works out at about $680,000 an  hour.\nWant  to know how he did it?\nHis  hedge fund locked up an 84% gain in 2006.\nWhich  makes you wonder:\nWhat\u2019s  Jim buying now?\nAnswer: A lot of one tiny company  stock that Emerging Growth subscribers were snapping up before him, at around $12.\u00a0 (It\u2019s still at $14.) \nWhat  is attracting the attention of a super-quant, crypto-analyst genius?\nFat\nIn  particular, the fat on your hips and especially the fat on your stomach, where  it is most liable to cause a heart attack.\u00a0 \nA tiny company (144 employees) in St. Paul,  Minnesota has made a breakthrough in diagnosing and managing heart attack  risks.\u00a0 The diagnostic piece of the  business opens a big opportunity, but it is the risk-management piece that is  genuinely thrilling.\nIt\u2019s  no secret that heart problems are linked to weight, but until now no one has  been able to really help ordinary people get the weight off\u2014and keep it off.\nThis  is a quest that has ALREADY made scores of Emerging Growth subscribers, all over  the country, very rich.\u00a0 You see,  NutriSystem, which delivers every meal to your home, is a fantastic idea.\u00a0 The stock was $20 when we bought it and  it just flew through our filters.\u00a0 Emerging  Growth subscribers are up 160% in short order in NutriSystem.\nBut  this new weight-loss system should do even better\u2014because the solution is based  on personalized feedback as you go through your exercise routine.\nHow Does It\nWork?\nThree weeks ago and, I\u2019d  guess, with Jim Simons\u2019 billions, this tiny diagnostics company hooked up with  Garmin, the GPS people.\u00a0 Now Garmin  is a company that is likely to do for GPS what Apple did for MP3s, make no  mistake.\u00a0 \nGarmin has a fitness device for a niche group of  running enthusiasts, but by hooking it up to our company\u2019s metabolic training  program, it gives you voice-guided instructions to encourage you through a  personalized routine.\nWell, even I\u2019d give THAT a try (and I\u2019m allergic  to exercise!).\nAnd  when it hits the market, I bet millions of people will say the same!\nLet\u2019s Look At\nThe Numbers\n\nSales       growth: 53%\n Earnings        growth: 550% in the past 4 quarters\nOperating         margins: tripled\nSelling          at: 19 times forecasted earnings\nPEG Ratio: \u00a0a microscopic 0.04\nPotential: $25 in 6 \u2013 9 months\u2014a double        \n\nYou don\u2019t have to        be a math genius like Jim Simons to figure\u2014this is a screaming buy.\nDetails?\u00a0 Of course you want details!\u00a0 Go here.\nWant        More?\nIn today\u2019s issue        of Emerging Growth, just posted, I give you the skinny on 3 more under        $24 stocks that have passed our rigorous tests.\n\nthe        seismic surveyor that specializes in \u201cgentle\u201d exploration in        environmentally sensitive areas.\u00a0        Sales growth:

     earnings are released.\u00a0 This        is a $9 stock, with a Price-to-Earning ratio of 9, packing a 900%        earnings growth.\u00a0 They just        don\u2019t make a lot of these!
