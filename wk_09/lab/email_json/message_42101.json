The first works forlme out of the box, the very powerful glht can handle lmer(lme4), with strongsupport for multiple testing. Too bad the latter does not immediately work withlme, but it can be tweaked.\nIn both cases, you have to construct the contrast matrix, which can beerror-prone for complex models. To my knowledge (??), there is nosimple-to-handle package that generates this matrix with an intuitive interface.\nDieter\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
