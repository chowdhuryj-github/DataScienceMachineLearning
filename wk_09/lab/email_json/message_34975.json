I tried\ninserting paper=\"special\" and paper=\"letter\" in the bitmap call, but\nboth caused errors.  Also, the plot was in grayscale instead of color.  \n\nScott Waichler\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
