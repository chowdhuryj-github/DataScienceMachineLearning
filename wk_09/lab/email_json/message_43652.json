Yurchikhin and Kotov installed five debris shields last Wednesday and today's work will complete the job, giving the station's command module additional protection against potentially catastrophic impacts from micrometeoroids and space junk.\n\nThis is the 83rd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since assembly began in 1998 and the sixth this year. Going into today's EVA, 46 NASA astronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts and six fliers from Japan, Canada, Germany, France and Sweden had logged 503 hours and 28 minutes of spacewalk time building and maintaining the space station.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
