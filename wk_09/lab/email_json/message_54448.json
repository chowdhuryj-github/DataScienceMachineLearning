The company has to stay in business. \n  That means weekly paychecks for all it's employees so they can support \ntheir own families.  Even if you sell a few hundred copies this month, \nnext month's bills are just around the corner.  Even if the government \npays it all, your customer base is still microscopic.  It's not fair, \nbut that's life. \n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
