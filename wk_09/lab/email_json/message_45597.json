Due to my privileged African background, I have been consulted by an   erstwhile top-ranking member of a frontline liberation movement in Liberia, whose organization had engaged the Liberian government in a protracted civil war since 1975.My client now wishes to channel $20.5million into productive ventures instead  of war. He looks to make this investment discreetly under discretionary asset management arrangement.I\\u2019m seeking a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to   provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank account to  receive this fund, even an empty account can serve this purpose, or you   help   to seek an honest and, reliable businessman who can assist us.I suggest we start the first transfer with eight million Dollars   [$10,000,000] and upon the successful transfer of the first $10million  without   hitches or disappointment from you I shall re-apply for the remittance   of   the balance of the fund to your nominated account.    \n  I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with you   on   the possibility of my client placing this fund with you for management   either in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertaken   at   your discretion under terms to be agreed upon. He prefers that this investment be made in your country.I would be expecting your response in order that we may discuss further  in   detail.Get back to me via my private email address   (robert_butt1@yahoo.co.uk). \nYours faithfully, \nrobert butt. \n \n\n\n\n"}
