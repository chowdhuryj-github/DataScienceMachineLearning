For testing hypotheses in this model I used the linear.hypothesis function from the car package. A check with the results obtained in SAS proc MIXED with a repeated statement revealed an inconsistency in the results. The problem can be that the linear.hypothesis function (1) only gives the asymptotic chi square test and/or (2) only uses the residual error. Is there another solution to testing linear hypotheses in a gls model?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
