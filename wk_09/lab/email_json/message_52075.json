Then the estimated variance component was used\nas the variance component in the meta-regression with covariates.\nSince the variance component is based on the model without any\ncovariate, it should be overestimated for a model with covariate. I\nhave emailed the authors about this issue.\n\nA better approach is to use the MiMa function provided by Wolfgang Viechtbauer.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Mike W.L.
