From\nhttp://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html\n\n*Questions about statistics:* The R mailing lists are primarily intended for\nquestions and discussion about the R software. However, questions about\nstatistical methodology are sometimes posted. If the question is well-asked\nand of interest to someone on the list, it *may* elicit an informative\nup-to-date answer. See also the Usenet groups sci.stat.consult (applied\nstatistics and consulting) and sci.stat.math (mathematical stat and\nprobability).\n\n*Basic statistics and classroom homework:* R-help is not intended for these.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
