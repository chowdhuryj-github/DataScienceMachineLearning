There's a subtle difference however. You can turn your back on art\nDiscourse on virtue and they pass by in droves, whistle and dance the shimmy, and you've got an audience.\nAh just act the way ah feel.\nDoctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals.\nLord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying!\nChildren are living jewels dropped unsustained from heaven.\nAdvice is seldom welcome and those who want it the most always like it the least.\nThe man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.\nThe person who seeks all their applause from outside has their happiness in another's keeping .\nBetter a friendly refusal than an unwilling consent.\nEnthusiasm moves the world.\nThought is the blossom language the bud action the fruit behind it.\nAlthough it is generally known, I think it's about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.\nChristians are supposed not merely to endure change, nor even to profit by it, but to cause it.\nSo much to do, so little done, such things to be.\nThe book you don't read won't help.\n\u00a0"}
