However, these countries now seem to accept\nthat the Development Agenda will become part of the future agenda of WIPO,\nand they are trying to shape it by engaging with the proponents.\n\nBesides finalizing a list of proposals, this week's meeting is expected to\ndiscuss the future institutional framework and the follow-up activities for\nthe Development Agenda, which would have to be reflected in the report to\nthe WIPO General Assembly. The report should contain \"recommendations for\naction on the agreed proposals, and on a framework for continuing to\naddress, and where possible, to move forward, on the other proposals\nfollowing the 2007 General Assembly\".\n\nThis week's meeting began on Monday with opening plenary statements by\nregional groupings and representatives of some NGOs. The official meeting\nwas then suspended and work continued through the informal consultative\nprocess involving representatives of regional groupings held in a small\nroom.\n\nThe informal process is considering proposals for the Development Agenda\ngrouped in six clusters, with a regional grouping coordinating one of the\nclusters. Cluster A is on Technical Assistance and Capacity Building\n(coordinated by GRULAC); Cluster B on norm setting, flexibilities, public\npolicy and public domain (Africa Group); Cluster C on Technology transfer,\ninformation and communication technology and access to knowledge (Asian\nGroup); Cluster D on Assessments, Evaluation and Impact Studies (Central\nEuropean and Baltic States); Cluster E on Institutional matters including\nmandate and governance; and Cluster F on Other Issues (Caucasian, Central\nAsian and Eastern European Group).\n\nThis week's meeting is discussing a set of proposals (that had mainly been\nput forward by the Friends of Development Group) contained in Annex B of the\nCommittee's working document (PCDA/3/2). Another set in Annex A has already\nbeen discussed in the Committee's earlier meeting in February, and 24 of the\n40 proposals had been adopted.\n\nThe informal consultation (which is chaired by Ambassador Trevor Clarke of\nBarbados, who also chairs the PCDA) began work on Cluster A (Technical\nAssistance and Capacity Building) and reached agreement on four proposals:\n\n-- To assist Member States to develop and improve national IP institutional\ncapacity through further development of infrastructure and other facilities\nwith a view to making IP institutions more efficient and promote fair\nbalance between protection and the public interest. This technical\nassistance should also be extended to sub-regional and regional organization\ndealing with IP.\n\n-- To assist Member States to strengthen national capacity for protection of\ndomestic creations, innovations and inventions and to support development of\nnational scientific and technological infrastructure, where appropriate, in\naccordance with WIPO's mandate.\n\n-- To further mainstream development considerations into WIPO's substantive\nand technical assistance activities and debates, in accordance with its\nmandate.\n\n-- WIPO's legislative assistance shall be, inter alia, development-oriented\nand demand driven, taking into account the priorities and the special needs\nof developing countries, especially LDCs, as well as the different levels of\ndevelopment of Member States and activities should include time frames for\ncompletion.\n\nThe African group has also proposed a fifth proposal for WIPO to examine\nTRIPS flexibilities and give advice to developing countries on how to gain\naccess to medicines and food. However, the language of this proposal is\nstill being negotiated.\n\nThere were originally 16 proposals under this Cluster. But Barbados (which\ncoordinated the cluster) said that the rest of the proposals would not be\npursued either because these were agreed to in February or the proponents no\nlonger wish to pursue the proposals, the proposal has been dropped or the\nproposal has been reflected in other clusters.\n\nSeveral developing countries are concerned with a number of questions, as\nthe week progresses: whether the agreed proposals in Annex A will be\nreopened, the implementation of agreed proposals, the fora that will discuss\nand monitor the implementation of the agreed proposals and how to proceed\nwith the proposals on which there is limited agreement.\n\nThe Algerian Ambassador Idriss Jazairy, on behalf of the African Group, said\nthat the \"African Group considers the implementation phase of the adopted\nrecommendations as important, if not more important than the negotiation\nprocess, hence the importance of establishing an intergovernmental mechanism\nfor the implementation of the recommendations on Development Agenda which\nwould ensure the required degree of efficiency and transparency\".\n\nThe Ambassador added that the outcome of the WIPO Development Agenda \"could\ninclude the adopted proposals, the framework to continue the examination of\nthe pending proposals, the implementation mechanism along with the\nprovisions on the relevant financial and human resources which are necessary\nto bring this endeavour to a successful conclusion\".\n\nArgentina, on behalf of the Group of Friends of Development, said that the\nproposals agreed to in the meeting in February should not be reopened.\nBarbados, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries\n(GRULAC), also said that a vast majority of the delegations were of the view\nthat Annex A should not be reopened.\n\nIt also recognized the \"need to deal adequately with the institutional\nframework, including the mandate, and the architectural mechanisms for\nimplementation and oversight of agreed recommendations\". It added that it is\n\"open to discussing the early implementation of self-executing\nrecommendations\".\n\nWork on the proposals is expected to be finalized by Wednesday while\ndiscussion on the draft report to the GA that will contain recommendations\nis expected to be begin on Thursday, with the draft report being adopted on\nFriday.\n\nAn informal meeting was held in Singapore on 30 May-1 June (similar to a\nmeeting held in Delhi preceding the first PCDA meeting) to prepare for this\nweek's meeting. In Singapore, the African Group, the Group of Friends of\nDevelopment and the Singapore government each presented non-papers for\ndiscussion, although no formal negotiated document was produced from the\nmeeting.\n\nIn the Friends Group non-paper, 25 proposals were listed as proposals that\nshould emerge from this week's meeting. One of the proposals was a proposal\nto \"renew the mandate of the PCDA for 2 years in order to review the\nimplementation of the agreed recommendations and to continue discussions of\nproposals that were not subject of a decision in the 2006 General Assembly\".\n\nOn Monday, the PCDA meeting started with opening statements. On behalf of\nthe African Group, Ambassador Jazairy of Algeria said that the Development\nAgenda would allow promoting a well balanced international IP system, which\nwould be adapted to the needs of developing countries, promoting research,\nthe transfer of technology along with incentives to innovate while truly\nacting as a catalyst in the growth process in the countries concerned.\n\nHe said the tightening of intellectual property laws may be damaging to\ndeveloping countries, and the unilateral stretching of IP protection and the\ncontinuous expansion of the level and scope of IP had the most adverse\neffects on developing countries. This had proved to be a burden on economic\nand social costs, thereby hampering the very development of these countries.\n\nReferring to the TRIPS Agreement, the Group said that IPRs adopted in the\nglobalization era had worsened the situation in developing countries which\nrequired alignment with patent systems of the developed countries,\nundermining the ability of developing countries to safeguard interests as in\nhealth. These provisions eventually reduce the opportunities of using the\nflexibilities and exceptions needed to safeguard public interests such as\nhealth.\n\nIt wished that developing countries can take advantage of the same\nflexibilities which the majority of developed countries enjoyed when they\nwere at the same development stage, adding that this is why the IP regime\nshould include provisions on respect for national policy space. This policy\nspace is \"indispensable\" since it is about subscribing to international\nobligations, and since the countries do not have the legal or technical\ninstruments to face anti-competitive trade related practices.\n\nThe Africa Group said that no IP system however reliable can ever be\nsufficient to meet the development needs of disadvantaged countries. IP norm\nsetting should be governed by guidelines that counterbalance IP protection\nwith public access to knowledge and know-how.\n\nSaying that the high cost of IPRs perpetuates the current imbalance of\nlearning and access to information, the Group called on WIPO to play an\nactive role in transfer of technology, and access to knowledge enhanced\nthrough the extension of the public domain. The main goal of the Development\nAgenda is to operationalise the development dimension of IPRs.\n\nAlgeria also called for wider participation of non-governmental\norganizations in WIPO.\n\nChina stressed that full consideration should be given to the different\nlevels of development of member states and called for \"appropriate policy\nspace\" for developing countries. It added that protection of IP should be\nbalanced with public interest protection and that the protection of\ninnovation be balanced with transfer of technology.\n\nIt also said that WIPO as a UN agency has the responsibility to provide for\nan effective platform for developing countries and through pragmatic efforts\nto ensure that developing countries really benefit from IP.\n\nThe US said that the current framework in WIPO is sufficient to address\ndevelopment. It added that WIPO should deepen its expertise on IP and not\nstray away from it. It also said that efforts to weaken IP and to change\nWIPO's mission would not be consistent with the Development Agenda. +\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
