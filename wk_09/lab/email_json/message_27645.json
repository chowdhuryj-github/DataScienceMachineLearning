I need to make about 145 million\ncomparisons of the word patterns in pieces of text.  I basically\ncompare vectors that contain count data on a multitude of words and\nfind ones that are similar to others (145million X 2 %in% comparisons,\na couple million multinomial estimates).  The best I could do in R\nwould take about 9 hours of computation time (a matrix solution bogs\ndown because of the size of the matrix:  10k by 17k; a looping\nsolution takes too long).  I've been looking into whether a Java or C\nroutine would be the best alternative.  Seems to be quite a debate on\nthe web about which is faster, and I don't know how much of that\ndebate is up to date.  Any impressions out there regarding whether\nJava or C would be faster for this application and by how much?  I'd\nhave to learn quite a bit to implement either so I'd rather just work\non one.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
