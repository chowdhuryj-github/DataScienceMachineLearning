The alphabetical order\nthing is a side effect of the factor() function, and to avoid it you\nneed to supply the levels when you create the factor; e.g.\n\n> factor(month.name)\n [1] January   February  March     April     May       June      July\n [8] August    September October   November  December\n12 Levels: April August December February January July June March ... September\n>\n> factor(month.name, levels = month.name)\n [1] January   February  March     April     May       June      July\n [8] August    September October   November  December\n12 Levels: January February March April May June July August ... December\n\n(Note the different order of the levels)\n\nAs for the colors, you can add either\n\ncol=c(\"green\",\"purple\")\n\nor\n\npar.settings = list(superpose.polygon = list(col=c(\"green\",\"purple\")))\n\nThe first will change the color of the bars but not the legend, the\nsecond will change both. (The reasons this works are a bit convoluted\nif you are not familiar with lattice, and you don't really need to\nknow, so I won't go into them)\n\n-Deepayan\n\n\n> Thanks so much for your help.\n>\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Deepayan Sarkar [mailto:deepayan.sarkar@gmail.com]\n> Sent: May 10, 2007 4:58 PM\n> To: Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]\n> Cc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: Re: [R] Barplot by two variables\n>\n> On 5/10/07, Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]  wrote:\n> > Hi all\n> > I have a bit of a problem.
