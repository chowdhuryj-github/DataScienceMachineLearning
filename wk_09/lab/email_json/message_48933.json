For the life of me I cannot figure out how to do an accessible install of a distro via my BrailleNote's braille display. If anyone has hints or tips for me that'd be great. I don't have an external synth nor do I have the cash for one. I'll be connecting via a serial line. I need do be able to install a distro without any problems by september, and if anyone has a screen name and wants to talk me through this online feel free email me off list.\n\nCody\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
