And BTW, what a fantastic package.\n\nMy problem is that I have to carry out repeated Cholesky \nfactorization of a spares symmetric matrices, say Q_1, Q_2, ...,Q_n, \nwhere the Q's have the same non-zero pattern. I know in this case one \ndoes only need to carry out the symbolic factorization _once_ and \nthen follow that up with a numerical factorization for each of the \nQ_i's (re-using the general symbolic factorization each time). Does \nanybody know if this is possible using the Matrix package?\n\nThanks,\nGardar Johannesson\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
