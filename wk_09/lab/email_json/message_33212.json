If you do, then I\nwould expect that your computer would need to be assigned a static IP\naddress (perhaps by its own settings).  On Slackware systems, static\nIP addresses can be assigned in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf .\n\nYou might be able to increase the lease time from your computer with\nsome dhcpcd command line options or on your router using whatever\nsettings that device has.  I believe an option is available for dhcpcd\nto request an IP address or request that the lease for the previous IP\naddress be renewed without assigning a new IP--you will have to look\nit up for your particular router and Linux distribution to be sure to\nget the settings in the right place(s).  Posting more details about\nyour system here or looking up the man page for dhcpcd might help\nmore.\n\nHTH, and have a great day.\n\n\n\nOn Sat, May 19, 2007 at 11:53:23AM -0600, Littlefield, Tyler wrote:\n> hmm. it shouldn't be doing it that much.\n> Would it help if I disabled dhcp on the router?\n> Thanks,\n> ----- Original Message ----- \n> From: \"Ralph W.
