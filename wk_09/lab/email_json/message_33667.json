RPMs for the current version of R are no longer provided via CRAN\nfor these older operating system versions.  How can I compile my own RPM\nfor the current version of R, which I could then use to install R\nquickly and easily on multiple machines?  Perhaps the answer to this\nwould be a useful addition to the manual R Installation and\nAdministration.   Obviously, I am not a system administrator and I don't\ndeal with compiling from source code or using SRPMs very much.  If\nanyone can explain the process step-by-step or refer me to instructions\nfor the non-expert I would appreciate it.\n\nThank you,\nScott Waichler\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory\nscott.waichler _at_ pnl.gov\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
