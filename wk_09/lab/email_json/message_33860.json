If so, use\nsource() instead to run your script, then stop() will do what you want.\n\n/Henrik\n\nOn 5/21/07, Blew, Ted  wrote:\n> it is desired to abort an R script with a message, returning to the R \n> prompt, pending 'if' results, as follows:\n> ------------------------\n> first part of script\n> .\n> .\n> if (condition) {\n>  action\n> } else\n> {\n> 'error'\n> abort\n> }\n> .\n> .\n> remainder of script\n> ---------------------------\n>\n> note: 'stop' aborts the current script expression but keeps running \n> the script.[too little]\n>         'quit' aborts the r session.
