I keep getting this warning message, which shows up once\nfor each variable added to the model during variable selection:\n\nWarning message:\nerror(s) in modeling/prediction step in: cv.rate(vars = c(model,\ntryvar), data = data, grouping = grouping,\n\nI don't know how to interpret this warning. I do not have a separate\ndata set for cross validation. Is this important, or will \"stepclass\"\ndo leave-one-out cross-validation in the absence of other\ncross-validation data?\n\nAlso, when I run \"stepclass\" several times with identical parameters,\nit will give me a slightly different \"best\" model each time. It seems\nto me that it should always return the same model, as long as the\ndataset and call are the same. Am I missing something? Is there some\nrandomization going on behind the scenes that I'm unaware of?\n\nThanks in advance,\nNeil Losin\n\n-- \n_____\nNeil Losin\nUCLA Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\nneil.losin@gmail.com\n\nand\n\nNeil Losin Nature Photography\nhttp://www.neillosin.com\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
