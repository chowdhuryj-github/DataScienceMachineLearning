The ones that came with \nthe archive are for the Dectalk PC 1.  If you have the Dectalk PC 2, they \nwon't work.  If in doubt, use the drivers that originally came with the \ncard.  They should be on a 3.5-inch disk.  The Dectalk PC 2 is smaller \nthan the Dectalk PC 1.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
