I first installed and loaded {Matrix} as follows:\n\n > install.packages(\"Matrix\")\n > library(Matrix)\n\nThe package loaded successfully, however when I attempted to call  \nlmer, I received the following message:\n\nError: could not find function \"lmer\"\n\nI also tried:\n\n< ?lmer\n\nwhich produced no search results.\n\nI have attempted these actions in both MacOSx R Versions 2.4.1 and  \n2.5.0.  I have also tried this in Version 2.5.1. beta on a Windows  \nmachine.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\nSteve\n____________________________________\nSteven P.
