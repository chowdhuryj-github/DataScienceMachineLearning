The competitions encourage participants to create \"network mashups\" that merge telecommunications features such as voice and text messaging with Web 2.0 applications like mapping and search.\n\nIn the Assembly stage of the competition, developers create a prototype for a mashup idea which came out of the first design competition. \n\nPrizes will be awarded to the top three mashup assembly submissions for a total prize purse of $10,000.
