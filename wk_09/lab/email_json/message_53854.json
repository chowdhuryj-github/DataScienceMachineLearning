This decision was  based on the automatic  error monitoring\npolicy in  effect for the  list, and has  not been reviewed  or otherwise\nconfirmed by  a human being. If  you receive this message,  it means that\nsomething is  wrong: while you are  obviously able to receive  mail, your\nmail system has been regularly reporting that your account did not exist,\nor that  you were otherwise permanently  unable to receive mail.  Here is\nsome  information  which may  assist  you  or  your  local help  desk  in\ndetermining the cause of the problem:\n\n- The failing address is ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA.\n\n- The first error was reported on 22 Jun 2007.\n\n- Since then, a total of 4 delivery errors have been received.\n\n- The last reported error was: Probe failed.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT  IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. While you can  of course re-subscribe\nto the list, it is important for  you to report this problem to your mail\nadministrator so that  it can be solved. This problem  is not specific to\nthe PRIMETIME list,  and also affects your private mail.  This means that\nYOU HAVE PROBABLY LOST SOME PRIVATE  MAIL AS WELL. Anyone trying to write\nto you  during the same time  frame will probably have  received the same\nerrors for  the same reason.  The PRIMETIME list is  but one of  the many\npeople who  may have  tried to write  to you while  your mail  system was\nmalfunctioning.\n\n\n"}
