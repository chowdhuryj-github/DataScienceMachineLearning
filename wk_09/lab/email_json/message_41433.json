Basically I need a recent kernel with \nspeakup, the bd-claim patch and the bad-block relocation applied to it.\nI can apply these patches and speakup to Vanilla sources; however defaults \nfor the .config have me a little stumped and i'd rather not do the whole \nconfig myself without guidance unless I absolutely have to.\n\nIn the sarge days i'd grab 2.6.15, apply Marvell ethernet patches and \nspeakup then build 2 or 3 different images with speakup and vmware features \nin them.\n\nLooks like kernels have gotten a little trickier since then.\n\nRegards, Kerry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
