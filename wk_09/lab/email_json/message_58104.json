Two years in the making! The day that our new film, \"Sicko,\" arrives in theaters all across North America! Click here to see where the nearest one is to you. \n\n\nAfter you go, let me know what you think. Oh, and send us a photo or a video from your cell phone to show us what it looked like at your theater. We'd love to post a photo from each of the 440 movie theaters showing \"Sicko.\"\n\n\nTo read more about the movie, you can go to www.michaelmoore.com.\n\n\nHere's what this morning's review in the L.A. Times said: \"It's likely his most important, most impressive, and most provocative film.\" Okay, what do they know? I prefer to trust the assessment of E! Television Online: \" 'Sicko' - the best movie ever? Maybe.\" Maybe? MAYBE?! When will they ever give me a break?\n\n\nIt's been a weirdly funny week. First Larry King bumped me for Paris Hilton. Then today, when CNBC invited me to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for an interview, the stock exchange said I was barred from the building. On top of that, Tony Blair is gone, Cheney says he's no longer answerable to anyone's elected government, and I simply don't want an iPhone. Just another week in America.\n\n\nHope you enjoy the movie!\n\n\nYours,\nMichael Moore\nmmflint@aol.com\n\n\n\n\n---\nYou are currently subscribed to Mike's Message as: ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca\n\nTo unsubscribe click on the link below:\n\nhttp://go.netatlantic.com/u?id=52827208F&l=michaelmoore\n\n\n"}
