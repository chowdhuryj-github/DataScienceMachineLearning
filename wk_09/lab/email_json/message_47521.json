Most of it was on the original post for the\n\"Tools For Preparing Data For Analysis\" thread from last week, but it\ngot overlooked.\nThey are all given under an open source license.\nCheck 'em out!\n\n*******************************************************\n\nVilno: data transformation software, that reads in input datasets\n(rows and columns), crunches through the data, and writes out output\ndatasets. It's an open source application that can replace the SAS\ndatastep ( and also replaces proc transpose and proc means ).\n\nFind it at: http://code.google.com/p/vilno\n( look in the download section for a tarball, it's a Linux\napplication, can be opened up (and maybe installed) on an Apple as\nwell ).\n\n************************************************\n\nDAP and PSPP: open source implementations for SAS and SPSS.\n\nFind it at: http://directory.fsf.org/math/stats\n\n*************************************************\n\nAwk: data transformation/filtering software for semi-structured ASCII files.\nA predecessor to Perl.\n\nFind it at: a lot of places, but try:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html\n\n*********************************************\n\nSome, but not all , data crunching problems can be handled fairly well by an\nall-purpose programming language, such as Perl or Python or Ruby.\nSome, but not all, data crunching problems can be handled reasonably\nwell with the\nS programming language ( i.e., R ).\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
