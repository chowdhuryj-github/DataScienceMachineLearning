Then it was\nused euphemistically to be polite about an assertion one *was* certain\nabout, but felt was bad for the other party so wanted to soften the\nstatement. Eventually this euphemistic usage became the main\nunderstanding.\n\nMost native English speakers, I think, would read the above as \"Though\nI regret the fact, I am certain that \". To express\nuncertainty, it might be clearer to say \"I fear that \" or\n\"I think that \".\n\n-- \n \\          \"About four years ago, I was -- no, it was yesterday.\"  -- |\n  `\\                                                     Steven Wright |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
