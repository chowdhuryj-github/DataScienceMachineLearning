Do they exist?\n\nFor example, is there a copy of\nparrot/trunk/docs/html/compilers/tge/TGE.pir.html anywhere?  There is\nnothing at http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/compilers/tge/TGE.pir.html\n\nThe reason I ask is that I am writing a web page about how to start using\nParrot and want to reference these documents.\n\nThanks,\nAndrew\n\n"}
