We might leave it in for testing\nbut I would like to avoid it in the final 3.0.26 release.\nIt can take so long to remove parameters from smb.conf once\nthey are in released version.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGZA1zIR7qMdg1EfYRAjyFAKChUgBzTUjcmZIj8X8ZdIFqDR/9hQCfXXp1\nFMmybUBkinnoCLimId8HsSw=\n=Pwzk\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
