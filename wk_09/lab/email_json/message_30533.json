I do have two more questions and hope you can help.  I have\nanother analysis exactly like the last one except it is done by month\ninstead of year.  When I graph it using barchart it makes the months go\nin alphabetical order.  Is there anyway to change it so that the months\ngo in the correct order (jan, feb, march, etc,).  And how do I change\nthe colors of the bars in the graph, they are weird colors and I want to\nchange them.  \nThanks so much for your help.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Deepayan Sarkar [mailto:deepayan.sarkar@gmail.com] \nSent: May 10, 2007 4:58 PM\nTo: Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Barplot by two variables\n\nOn 5/10/07, Spilak,Jacqueline [Edm]  wrote:\n> Hi all\n> I have a bit of a problem.
