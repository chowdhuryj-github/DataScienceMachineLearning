Or some such.\n\nThis is almost entirely theoretical, as I'd much rather display a Yahoo\nad to display my allegiance with their opponent, but given the legal\nminds on this list, I thought it might be interesting to hear what\n*would* make the pictures illegal, since privacy concerns won't do it.\n\nThanks,\nErinn\n\n-- \noff the chain like a rebellious guanine nucleotide\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
