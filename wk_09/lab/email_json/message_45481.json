What I've found more interesting and\nintelligible over the years is psychology, and that's come in mighty handy\nin the investing business.\n\nPsychology, of course, is what moves stocks.  Sure, the media will pretend\nthat it's fundamentals that move stocks, but it's not. Fundamentals don't buy \nand sell stocks; people buy and sell stocks.  And people, as we all know, are \nnot always rational.\n\nBut people can be taught!  Ideally, you get a great education when you're\nyoung, because the younger you are, the more teachable you are.  But\nthere's no reason that you can't learn at any age, given sufficient\nmotivation and perseverance.\n\nFor this knowledge, we are indebted to those brain experts who did go\nthrough medical school, and who continue to discover more about the\namazing bundle of nerves we carry inside our skull.\n\nThey tell us that when we're young, the brain is amazingly malleable, that\nit's a cinch to learn French when you're six years old.  And they tell us\nthat as we age, learning new skills gets just a little bit harder every\nyear.\n\nBut we are always capable of learning, and what typically fades before the\nability to learn is the desire.  We get set in our ways.  We get comfortable.  \nAnd we see little benefit to doing things differently than we've done before.\n\nBut I'm a strong believer in life-long learning.  And today I'm going to\ngive you three lessons on becoming a better investor.\n\nNote: It won't do to just read the list and say, \"Yeah, I'm going to do that.\"\n\nTo learn these habits, you have to practice them.  You have to put in the\ntime.  In essence, you have to train your brain to think in new patterns.\n\nIt's the same thing in any profession.\n\nThe more a baseball player takes batting practice, the more efficient he\nmakes the necessary connections in his brain, and the better his hand-eye\ncoordination, reflexes and more.  They call it muscle memory, but it all\nhappens in the brain.\n\nThe same is true of a piano player; he's using small muscles instead of\nbig muscles, and he's also using the part of the brain that recognizes,\ntempo, pitch, tonality, rhythm and more.\n\nIt's true of the geologist interpreting seismic data in a hunt for oil.\n\nAnd it's true of the mailman, who learns the names and addresses on his\nroute by simple repetition, whether he tries to or not.\n\nIn brief, all this learning happens because neurons in the brain produce\nimpulses, which carry tiny electrical currents. These currents cross the\nsynapses between neurons with chemical transporters called\nneurotransmitters, and the more often the same paths are used, the more\nefficient those pathways become.\n\nUnfortunately, pathways left unused get progressively less efficient,\nwhich is why if you've never learned a foreign language, you're going to\nhave a heck of a time doing it once you're past middle age.\n\nSo here are the three habits that will make you a better investor.\n\nOne - Learn to keep your losses small.\n\nThink of investing as a pinball game at the arcade.  You pay an entry fee,\nand as long as you have credits, you can continue playing.  If you're\ngood, your credits increase.  But if you fail to make the right moves, and\nyour credit drops to zero, you can't play anymore.  In the investing world, \nwhere the credits are real dollars, you never want that to happen.  So when \nthe trend turns against you, you sell and take a loss.\n\nWhen you take a loss, the world doesn't end.  You're left holding cash,\nwhich is a very good thing, and that cash is the entry fee to the game's\nnext round.\n\nSure, taking losses means admitting you were wrong, and that's a tough\nthing to do the first few times.  But with practice, your ego learns to\nlet go.  You accept that small losses are necessary if you're going to\nhave the entry fee for the next game.  And you learn to take losses\nquickly and easily.\n\nLook, for example, at Gateway (GTW), a stock that popped up on someone's\nundervalued list recently.  With revenues of nearly $4 billion a year and\na market capitalization of just $638 million, it certainly appears\nundervalued.  But you could have said that when the market cap was $2\nbillion, and then when it was $1 billion.\n\nThe trouble at Gateway, of course, is that the company has had trouble\ngrowing.  It lost money in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  And while it\nreturned to profitability in 2005, it still faces a raft of formidable\ncompetitors in Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Sony and others.\n\nIf you had been holding Gateway at any time in the past seven years and\nfound yourself with a loss, selling quickly would have been the wisest\ncourse.  Sure, sometimes stocks you sell bounce back and move on to new\nhighs.  That's life.  But lost opportunity is far less painful than lost\nmoney.  So learn to sell quickly.\n\nTwo - Learn to look at charts.\n\nWe're all raised as fundamental thinkers, and thus most investors focus on\nfundamentals, reasoning that if a company has growing revenues and\nearnings, its stock should increase.\n\nBut stocks do not move on fundamentals alone.  They move because of hopes\nand dreams, fear and greed.  This week, for example, fears of inflation\nreturned to the market, driving stocks down sharply.  Nothing has changed \nat most companies, yet most stocks are down.  That's fear at work.\n\nAnd you can't ignore this.  What you should do, ideally on a daily basis,\nis look at the charts of each one of your stocks to get a picture of how\nthey're performing.  It's not enough to look at a ledger and see that you\nhave a profit.  You want to see if the stocks are still in uptrends.  You\nwant to watch for signs of accumulation or distribution.  And if a stock\nis no longer in an uptrend, and no longer under accumulation, you want to\nthink about getting rid of it.\n\nNow, chart-reading is not easy.  And it's not a perfect science; there is\nno perfection in investing.  But the more charts you look at, the more you\ncome to recognize the patterns and rhythms that matter.  We call it\n\"looking for familiar faces,\" or patterns that we've seen before that\nusually lead to an upmove or a downmove.  Over time, charts become your\nfriends, and if you look at enough of them, over time, you'll one day find\nthat you are unable to buy a stock without first getting a good look at\nits chart.\n\nThree - Learn to imagine how big success might be achieved.\n\nOver the years, some of Cabot's best winners have come from companies that\nprovided a revolutionary product or service to the mass market.   \nA decade ago it was Amazon (AMZN), which started by selling books but\neventually came to sell almost everything.  If you had the foresight at\nthe beginning to see that possibility, you might have been an earlier\nbuyer of Amazon!\n\nMore recently (last October) the Cabot Market Letter recommended buying\nCrocs (CROX), the maker of funny-looking shoes.  It served a mass market. \nIts products were revolutionary.  But could the company grow to be\nsomething more than a maker of funny-looking shoes?   \nAbsolutely.  Crocs has been expanding its portfolio of shoes rapidly and\nthis week the company rolled out its fall line-up, featuring 13 new\nmodels, including some that have a more traditional appearance and use\ncanvas, leather and shearling while retaining that trademark Crocs\ncomfort.\n\nIf you had imagined this brand expansion earlier, you might have been an\nearlier buyer of Crocs!\n\nAdmittedly, it's not easy to think creatively about where companies might\ngo.  But when you do, you'll find that you can more easily justify\ninvesting in revolutionary companies, and that's where some of the biggest\nprofits are made.  So practice it . . . starting today.   Look at each\nstock in your portfolio and ask yourself, \"What are the growth\nopportunities for this company?\"\n\nWith practice, you'll train your brain to more readily identify these big\nprofit-makers, and you'll find yourself being an early buyer of\nrevolutionary world-changing companies.\n\n==\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking For Steady Individual Stock Returns Of 124%... 169%... 103%...\n189% And More?\n\nLook no further than the Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter. It's the only\nadvisory in the country that applies the fundamental principals of\nBenjamin Graham to stock picking.\n\nBenjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, taught his\nwealth-building secrets to Warren Buffett, Mario Gabelli and John Neff\namong others ... each of whom went on to establish fantastic fortunes.\n\nRecent Value Letter winners include:\n\n*  Total System Services (a processor of credit cards) up 56.4% in 17 months.\n*  Reliance Steel (a metals wholesaler) up 32% in 12 months.\n*  Exxon Mobil (you know who they are!) up 22% in 8 months.\n\nIn fact, since its inception at the end of 1995, Roy's Wise Owl Model has\nracked up a compound annual return of 16.5% compared to 7.4% for the S&P\n500. And the Classic Model is up 26.2% compounded since 2002, compared to\na gain of 8.4% by the Dow!\n\nTo learn more about the Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter AND a special\noffer for readers of Cabot Wealth Advisory, click the link below.\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/195123/13148861/97/0/\n\n==\n\nSpeaking of practice, New York City was the location of the Pac-Man World\nChampionship this week, scheduled to promote the release of Pac-Man\nChampionship Edition for Xbox 360.  Pac-Man has been around for 28 years,\nand remains one of the most popular video games of all time.  And it's an\nactivity (it's hard to call it a career) that certainly requires practice.\n The victor was 27-year-old Carlos Daniel Borrego Romero from Mexico.  His\nprize?  A new Xbox and one free sandwich a week from Quiznos, for 26\nyears!\n\n==\n\nGetting back to the brain . . . today, most medicines that target brain\nfunction are digested in the stomach, and then must work their way through\nthe bloodstream to the brain; it's a rather indirect route, to say the\nleast.  But back on May 3, I wrote about a drug company that was working\non transport mechanisms to deliver drugs through the blood-brain barrier.\n\nThe company is Xenoport (XNPT), and it had recently earned a spot in Cabot\nTop Ten Report after its stock shot up from 28 to 42.  The reason for the\nstrength?  The company reported that a test of its drug to treat restless\nleg syndrome (RLS) had yielded promising results.\n\nNow, this company has never sold a single product and never made a single\ndime, so it is definitely a speculation.\n\nBut I thought it worth mentioning then -  and now - because I think\nXenoport has huge potential.  I can imagine (as suggested above) that the\ncompany will have great success by introducing many drugs that penetrate\ndirectly to the brain.\n\nSo I'm keeping an eye on it . . . by looking at the chart.\n\nBack on May 3, I wrote, \"if you're in the mood for an aggressive\nspeculation, you can take a small position here . . .today, the stock is\nstill at 42, having pulled back slightly from last Thursday's high of\n44.\"\n\nWell, since then it's been up to 45 and back down to 41.  We call this\n\"building a base.\"  As long as the stock holds above 40, the base remains\nintact.  But if it falls below 40, the next support level is 37, where we\nfind the 50-day moving average, and that's not quite as attractive.\n\nIf you're interested, keep an eye on it along with me.\n\n==\n\nEditor's note:\n\nTo get regular updates on Xenoport, and other hot stocks, consider a trial\nsubscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.
