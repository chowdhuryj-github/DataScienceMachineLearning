(I am a big fan)\n\nIn fact I did read that FAQ. But missed the point actually. I made up\nin my mind that warnings should be cured at all times, not ignored/\nsuppressed.  But it makes sense turning off warning for that block.\nAnd it solves my problem.\n\nI was thinking of going for more complex solutions. Like deleting the\nhidden fields and replacing them with textboxes with value, then\nsubmitting the form. :-? But my head is healthy again.\n\n--Sumon\n\nOn Jun 23, 11:49 pm, t...@stonehenge.com (Tom Phoenix) wrote:\n> On 6/23/07, skywriter14  wrote:\n>\n> > I have been trying to set some hidden form fields with\n> > WWW::Mechanize, but I get error that they are read only.\n>\n> Have you seen this entry in the FAQ?\n>\n>     Why do I get \"Input 'fieldname' is readonly\"?\n>\n>     You're trying to change the value of a hidden field and you\n>     have warnings on.\n>\n>     First, make sure that you actually mean to change the field\n>     that you're changing, and that you don't have a typo.
