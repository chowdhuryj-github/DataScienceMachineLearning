I've tried the following:\n\nModel 1: lme(response ~ tissue*Gender, random = ~1|subject)\nModel 2: response ~ tissue*Gender + subject\nModel 3: response ~ tissue*Gender\n\n\nIt seems like Model 1 is the correct one since my experiment design is\nnested design. However, can anybody tell me whether Model2 is\ncompletely illegal?\n\nThanks\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
