TopCoder Marathon Matches provide a flexible competition format with an extended timeline that offers different types of problems than what can be offered in a traditional TopCoder algorithm round.  These competitions are a bit more leisurely than the traditional TopCoder algorithm competitions and will allow you to spend as much or as little time as you'd like - whenever you'd like.\n\nThe current competition has recently started and will run through May 30, 2007.  Check out the standings and register here: \nhttp://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewActiveContests\n\nYou may register at any time during the competition.\n\nTopCoder also provides practice Marathon Match style problems here:  \nhttp://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewPractice&rt=14\n\nTo learn more about TopCoder Marathon Matches, check here:\nhttp://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=Static&d1=instructions\n\n\nBest of luck to you!\n\n- TopCoder Competitions Team \n\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of TopCoder Competitions.
