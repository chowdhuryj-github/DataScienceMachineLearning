If you want to say stop_it(@DNS)\nand actually do something with the the other values in @DNS you will\nneed a loop inside the sub:\n\nsub stop_it {\n    for my $vm (@_) {\n        my $state = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \"$vm\" getstate -q`;\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    }\n}\n\nIf you really only want to work with the first value in @DNS then you should say\n\nstop_it($DNS[0]);\n\nto avoid confusing people.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
