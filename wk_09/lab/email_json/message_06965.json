It's fair to say that LRE<3 is somewhat alarming,\nbut is the difference between LRE=9 and LRE=10 all that important?\nCertainly this difference is overwhelmed by model uncertainty.\nOr is the idea that the numerical precision we can see in these\ncases is the tip of the iceberg and indicates the overall level\nof trust we have in the software?\n\n   Ben\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
