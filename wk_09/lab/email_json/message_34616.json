The\nrevue charmingly repurposes songs from the Sondheim book to tell a\nnarrative about a cocktail party and a series of relationships and\nsituations that arise therein.\nWith crisp, well-balanced harmonies and potent but not overpowering\norchestrations, the songs sound especially vibrant, and even the\npassionate wailing of both Hudson and Knowles resists distortion.\nMost of a viewer's time is spent waiting for something to happen,\nboredom punctuated with bursts of action.\nThrown in as generous bonuses are episodes of the Lost Treasures series\nthat NFL Films produced. It's an entertaining re-cap of the season,\nwhich saw the Steelers win their first title, over the Vikings. Catching\nit on the Cartoon Network from time to time myself, I gather that it is\nan engaging series for preteens.\nSince then, NFL Films has become an vital part of the NFL, becoming what\nI would imagine is the most successful industrial film house of them\nall. I've had a love-hate relationship with Reggie Miller through the\nyears. It's a great premise for a movie, and generally it's taken\nadvantage of; but some of the necessary story elements do feel a little\nshopworn. The genuine affection between them makes it easy relate to\neven this slightly lecherous husband.\nCondon's articulate comments inform and enlighten, but everyone involved\ncontributes fascinating tidbits.\nThrown in as generous bonuses are episodes of the Lost Treasures series\nthat NFL Films produced.\nThe print appears to be surprisingly clean, with only minimal specking\nand dirt, although grain is a constant. He's actually kind of goofily\nmoving as he moons over Sacagawea, another of the museum's nocturnal\ninhabitants. It's functional and not much more.\nBy parodying the likes of educational films, children's shows or\ncommercials, the margin for error is pretty wide open, and in fairness\nsome of the humor or concepts do work. Curtis' attention, however,\nchanges her mind, and the two soon begin a rocky romance that's later\ncomplicated by his growing attraction to Deena.\nMore Future Releases DVD Top Sellers Family Guy, Vol.\ncom and its reviewers and writers.\nWe don't learn much about them personally; the focus is on their onfield\ndemeanor, which often means insulting and threatening their players,\nwhether it be overt or vague in manner. And when you're selling a\nmessage to someone like me who is already a convert, and that message is\na challenge to sit through, there's a larger fundamental problem.\nThe hardest part was teaching 'em to applaud.\nI've had a love-hate relationship with Reggie Miller through the years.\nThe Building the Dream documentary and the featurettes are obviously\nshot on digital video and they are breathtakingly gorgeous. Most of a\nviewer's time is spent waiting for something to happen, boredom\npunctuated with bursts of action. He performs two of his first big hits,\nAmarillo by Morning and A Fire I Can't Put Out, both from his second\nalbum.\nOn the other side, a beefy lifeguard gets to take on three nubile girls\nin nighttime pool pile-on, and here there's an abundance of lazy\nsoft-core grinding and bare flesh. George Strait only appeared once on\nthe program, when he was still a fresh new artist rather than a\nmega-selling star with a multitude of hit singles. Footage of\npre-recording sessions, screen tests, dance rehearsals, and run-throughs\nmakes us feel like we're really on the set, and bring this musical\nblockbuster down to earth.\nThe cameras don't show us anything cynical or nasty, and the rah-rah\nattitude he inspires comes off as utterly alien in this age of media\nwhores like Terrell Owens and the like. There is some moderate hiss, but\nvoice quality is generally clear, albeit largely unremarkable in any\nway.\nIt's a great premise for a movie, and generally it's taken advantage of;\nbut some of the necessary story elements do feel a little shopworn.\nHe performs two of his first big hits, Amarillo by Morning and A Fire I\nCan't Put Out, both from his second album.\nYou're gonna love me indeed. NFL Films gave football drama and mythology\nto go with the inherent violence, and America's new pastime took flight.\nGeorge: That's right, Victoria. And when you're selling a message to\nsomeone like me who is already a convert, and that message is a\nchallenge to sit through, there's a larger fundamental problem.\nLike a heavyweight prizefighter unloading a barrage of body blows,\nHudson pummels us with her pain, and it's impossible not to be moved by\nher intensity and instrument. The dialogue comes across nicely and there\nare decent directional effects across the front mains. Condon, however,\nputs his heart and soul into the project, and crafts a buoyantly\nentertaining, often exhilarating picture that maintains the energy and\npanache of the Broadway original. Audiences possess far more\nsophistication than many arrogant filmmakers believe, and Condon's\nconfidence in our ability to fully embrace the musical genre deserves\ncommendation. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to it, this new\ntwo-disc release of the second season is a great way to get acquainted.\nI know that my daughter has been a fan of the show for quite some time,\nbut for eight years?\nThe power of manipulative filmmaking, indeed.\nPosterization was quite limited however and on the whole the disc is\nvery attractive. While Edd is fixing it, Eddy tells Ed that he thinks\nDouble-D is an alien since he's so smart.\nThe focus is more on Allen than anything else, as the coach brings in\nhis preferred veteran players and tries to re-build a floundering\nfranchise.\nIt remains worthwhile fodder for debate among football fans, who can now\nadd in nearly three decades' worth more players to the arguments.\nNot essential, but worth a look. It's kind of a nudge-nudge-wink-wink\nsort of ploy, and considering there were thirteen of these films made\nover a decade says there was no doubt an audience. Lucky for us, the\nDreamgirls transfer aces every element. The one example of compression\nringing I noted was a sequence when Lorrell is seen in closeup in front\nof a vivid magenta backdrop; serious ringing was visible at that point.\nAgain, though, the plot is really just an excuse to throw together some\nSondheim classics.\nHe's outgrown his Perfect Strangers days, and his introduction to the\nshow here sets the easygoing and ever-so-slightly naughty tone of the\nshow perfectly.\nThis was filmed from a live performance, presumably limiting the audio\npresentation options somewhat, but nonetheless the track is full and\nrich in a way that showcases the music quite well.\nLike a heavyweight prizefighter unloading a barrage of body blows,\nHudson pummels us with her pain, and it's impossible not to be moved by\nher intensity and instrument.\n\n"}
