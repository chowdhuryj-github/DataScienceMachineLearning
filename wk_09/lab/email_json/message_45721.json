'When discussing architecture of a large\nand complex system, you can view the system from many perspectives.

The Linux kernel\nimplements a number of important architectural attributes. At a high\nlevel, and at lower levels, the kernel is layered into a number of\ndistinct subsystems. Linux can also be considered monolithic because it\nlumps all of the basic services into the kernel.

Lucie Morillon, the U.S.\nrepresentative for Reporters Without Borders, a French group that\npromotes free expression, said that the Beijing government often censors\nWeb sites under the guise of protecting children or national security.\nShe called the blocking of Flickr \"one more blow against the free flow of\ninformation online by Chinese authorities\" and added that it is\nparticularly lamentable in light of promises by China to loosen\nrestrictions before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.' Thomas Hawk has a\n[1]well-considered opinion to offer on this issue.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/09/1914226\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/09/BUG9VQC8QE1.DTL\n    1. http://thomashawk.com/2007/06/china-censors-flickr.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Attorney Sues Website Over His Online Rating                       |\n|   from the don't-put-me-in-a-box dept.                             |\n|   posted by Zonk on Saturday June 09, @19:46 (The Courts)          |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/09/1922239          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nAn anonymous reader writes \"The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is reporting\nthat a local attorney is suing legal startup Avvo over a [0]rating that\nwas algorithmically assigned. The story covers the controversy of\ncomputers grading humans. 'Browne, who has participated in a number of\nhigh-profile cases in the state, including the defense of arsonist Martin\nPang, said in an interview that Avvo is being irresponsible with the\nratings and called them a fraud. And he questioned why Supreme Court\njustices and prominent lawyers score so low. Three other attorneys\ninterviewed by the P-I also expressed doubts about the rating system,\nwhile News.com reported that the site \"seemed to be riddled with bizarre\nerrors.\"' Such practices are not new: the New York Times earlier this\nyear reported on Google [1]using algorithms to determine applicant\nsuitability. But what happens when you don't like the result? Can a\ncomputer program be considered defamatory?\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/09/1922239\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/116417.asp#extended\n    1. http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E7DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
