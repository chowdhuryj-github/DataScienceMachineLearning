It isn't very legible anyway.\n\nYou should never be able to make PIR segfault; I will look into this.\nIf you wouldn't mind sending your test case, that might save me some\ntrouble.\n\n   To solve this we can omit printing the sub name in Parrot_free_context.\n   A patch that does this is in . Using -D80 does become\n   less legible, but I think we prefer more correct behavior.\n\n   Thanks,\n   -- \n   Bram Geron | GPG 0xE7B9E65E\n\nIt is really useful to print the sub name, especially when there are\nlots of contexts flying around.  (For the record, I'm the one who\nchanged it to do so.)  The 0xdeadbeef test was trying to work around\nsubs that were prematurely garbage-collected; I will try to fix this\nfirst.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob Rogers\n\t\t\t\t\t   http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/\n\n"}
