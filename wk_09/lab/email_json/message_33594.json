You get a \nmessage that it is making links, but not that it has finished doing so. I \nthink you will find it is the next step (make.packages.html()) that takes \nthe time.  On my system with all of CRAN and all of BioC installed, the \nlinking takes about 3s and the next step takes 20 (at a time it was \nheavily loaded).\n\nOn Mon, 21 May 2007, Ronaldo Reis Junior wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> When I use help.start() R spends some time to make links in per-session dir.
