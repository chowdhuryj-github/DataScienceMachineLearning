Did you get such a feeling? It's strange. Relations begin and then somehow\nthey go to nowhere, just disappear. Of course I understand that maybe this is the influence of differences we have\nbetween us, but on the other hand I think that difference of language and culture is not the most terrible thing,\nmaybe this can make relations even more interesting? How do you think?\nIs this possible that two adult people who were attracted to each other from the very beginning suddenly have no\nthings to discuss? I believe that everybody's personality has many different sides and there will never be enough of\ntime to explore it completely. I've even thought that maybe this need to write letters really pushes at us and don't\ngive us enough of free space, because it's really difficult to explain with words what you can show with your eyes and\nmimics sometimes. Do you agree?\nSo, I will wait for your reply. I know that maybe my thoughts will seem strange to you, but somehow I begun to think\nabout this and I would like to know if there is any chance to change this for better and to continue learning each\nother without any pressure, I mean without feeling that you write because you have to reply and not because you want.\nFind me here http://lovemeanyou.com/smiling\n\n\nSweet goodbye\n\nIra G\n\n\n"}
