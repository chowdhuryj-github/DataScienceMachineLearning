The relevant\ndocumentation is the part under 'key' in help(barchart). I prefer to\nuse 'auto.key' instead (and you haven't told us what you are using),\nbut most components of 'key' can be passed through 'auto.key'. Some\nexamples:\n\n\nbarchart(Titanic,\n         auto.key = list(space = \"right\", size = 2, cex = 0.5))\n\n\nbarchart(Titanic,\n         auto.key = list(x = 0.75, y = 0.25, size = 2))\n\n\n## choose location interactively:\n\nlibrary(grid)\n\nbarchart(Titanic,\n         page = function(n) {\n             cat(\"Click on plot to place legend\", fill = TRUE)\n             ll <- grid.locator(unit = \"npc\")\n             if (!is.null(ll))\n                 draw.key(simpleKey(dimnames(Titanic)$Survived,\n                                    rect = TRUE, points = FALSE),\n                          vp = viewport(x = ll$x, y = ll$y),\n                          draw = TRUE)\n       })\n\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
