Espeak's volume range is 0 to 200 with\na default of 100, and speech-dispatcher is from -100 to 100 with a\ndefault of 0.  I have attempted \"GenericVolumeAdd 100\" and\n\"GenericVolumeMultiply 100\", but that did not seem to work.  Does anyone\nhave any other suggestions?\n\nThanks much,\n\n- -- \nWilliam Hubbs\ngentoo accessibility team lead\nwilliamh@gentoo.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.7 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGYxWGblQW9DDEZTgRArpOAJ48XH6y5QuZAcSNaYrp7E5fxzyfEQCgkezm\nsTncUaTwf8maqR61zvm4pF8=\n=W6tt\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
