If something resembling Chas Owens's\nsolution works, you can turn a grammar into a module by the means\ndescribed under \"Precompiling parsers\". Then you can pull the Perl\ncode out of that module, and the PHB never has to know you didn't\nwrite it yourself.\n\n    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-RecDescent/lib/Parse/RecDescent.pod#Precompiling_parsers\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
