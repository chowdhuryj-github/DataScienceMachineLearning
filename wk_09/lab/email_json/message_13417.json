You could imagine doing something similar for continuous\nvariables.  This would have the interesting property that plots of\nsubsets would have the same range as plots of the original data.  I'd\nimagine, just as with factors, this would be useful and frustrating in\nequal parts.\n\nIn terms of which should be the default, I can imagine two arguments:\n\n * keep to the original format of the data as closely as possible:\ncharacter vectors should be the default\n\n * maintain as much information about the original data as possible:\nfactors should be the default.\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
