This is Sadhana Bharati, 11, the kind of over-precocious child that makes you wish someone generously smeared strawberry flavoured lip balm onto duct tape.\n\nSadhana, hyped by the Congress as their pint-sized answer to Uma -- why any party should seek such a thing is itself beyond comprehension; the idea of an Uma Bharti mini-me is absolutely nightmarish -- has apparently been speaking in public since before she was 3. Now she's a seasoned political campaigner, talking about herself in the third person as she shouts out BJP-deriding slogans.\n\nSadhana talks like a sycophantic vet, all fire and brimstone as she constantly invokes herself into her speech. She calls herself a daughter to everyone from Rahul Gandhi to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and asks for the public's applause. Initially amused, the crowds indulge her -- till the Congress announcer cuts her short and tersely asks her, again, to wind up.\n\n--!>\nVisit here to get enrolled for your Criminal Justice degree!      \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
