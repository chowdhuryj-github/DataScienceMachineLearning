Best solution?", "body": "I would suggest a dual boot configuration like this:\n\nCreate a windows ntfs partition for winxp.\nCreate a windows fat32 partition for data.\nCreate a linux ext3 partition for linux root filesystem\nCreate one or more linux ext3 partitions for linux data\nCreate a linux swap partition.\n\nNever store anything you want to save in the winxp\nor linux root partitions. This way if you ever need to\nreinstall either you leave your data partitions alone \nand never lose anything important.\n\nThe windows fat32 data partition can be mounted in\nlinux so you can move files to and from windows. \nNote that ntfs is read only in linux so best to use fat32\nfor this partition.\n\nMake one of the linux data partitions the /home mount.\nI usually make a small partition for /home but a large \none, actually several, for data. I also usually create a \nseparate /usr/local partition for software I compile from\nsource to add to the original distro, but that's not really\nnecessary. The reason I do it is so its easy to save stuff\nthat might have taken a while to figure out when adding\nextra software.\n\nFor the bootloader config, set winxp to be the default \nboot, linux as the second choice. If you use a timeout \nthen it will automatically start winxp for your father. \nIf you don't want to use timeout, just tell him to pick \nwinxp from the boot menu always.\n\nThere is also the possibility of using vmware but I am \nfinding that vmware is getting to be a performance \nproblem lately, at least with the new free versions. \nBest to have a dual boot into native os and then you \ncan still add some vmware on either or both winxp\nor linux in addition to the dual boot.\n\nI used to have a laptop setup that could dual boot into\nnative win2k or linux, but could also run linux inside \nvmware on win2k, that was really nice. It used the \nvmware workstation 5, which seemed to be much \nbetter than the free vmware server that they give away.\n\nAnother suggestion: create a rescue partition, and set\nup a small linux system with speech enabled, add this\nto your boot menu. If you ever have problems with \nthe other bootables, you can boot into that and then\nmount other drives to make any necessary changes. \nIf you boot into the rescue partition you can chroot\ninto the regular linux root filesystem if its not booting.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
