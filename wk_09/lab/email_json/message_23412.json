It is already 'imported.\nYou just need to work with it, probaly as a data.frame\n\n> I guess it is not yet a data set, and I don't know\n> how to manipulate variables from it.\n> When I type \"japan\", here is an extract of what I\n> get.\n-\n>  \n>     LDP NFP SKG JCP gender education age1    80  75 \n> 80   0   male         1  752    75  80  50  20\n> female         1  643   100  25 100   0   male      \n>   2  564    75  50  25  50   male         2  525   \n> 75  50  50   0   male         4  52\n> I have saved the following objet in a file called\n> \"japan.RData\".

If you\nhave a Japan then you can do Japan$LPD or Japan[,1] or\nan attach(Japan) and then refer to LPD.  Each approach\nhas its advantages. \n\nSee http://www.r-project.org/ for some basic\ninformation on the subject.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
