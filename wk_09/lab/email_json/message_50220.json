There are several ways a\npatient's stay in the emergency department can end (discharge, admit, etc..)\nso I am looking at modeling the effects of several covariates on the various\noutcomes. Initially I am trying to fit a  survival model for each type of\noutcome using the psm function in the design package,  i.e., all  patients\nwho's visits  come to an end  due to  any event other than the event of\ninterest are considered to be censored.  Being new to the psm and  survreg\npackages (and to parametric survival modeling) I am not entirely sure how to\ninterpret the coefficient values that psm returns. I have included the\nfollowing code to illustrate code similar to what I am using on my data. I\nsuppose that the coefficients are somehow rescaled , but I am not sure how\nto return them to the original scale and make sense out of the coefficients,\ne.g., estimate the the effect of higher acuity on time to event in minutes.\nAny explanation or direction on how to interpret the  coefficient values\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\nthis is from the documentation for survreg.object.\ncoefficientsthe coefficients of the linear.predictors, which multiply the\ncolumns of the model matrix. It does not include the estimate of error\n(sigma). The names of the coefficients are the names of the\nsingle-degree-of-freedom effects (the columns of the model matrix). If the\nmodel is over-determined there will be missing values in the coefficients\ncorresponding to non-estimable coefficients.\n\ncode:\nLOS <- sort(rweibull(1000,1.4,108))\nAGE <- sort(rnorm(1000,41,12))\nACUITY <- sort(rep(1:5,200))\nEVENT <-  sample(x=c(0,1),replace=TRUE,1000)\npsm(Surv(LOS,EVENT)~AGE+as.factor(ACUITY),dist='weibull')\n\noutput:\n\npsm(formula = Surv(LOS, CENS) ~ AGE + as.factor(ACUITY), dist = \"weibull\")\n\n       Obs     Events Model L.R.       d.f.
