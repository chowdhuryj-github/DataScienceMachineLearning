The distribution  \nfunction (cdf) from which the prng is supposed to sample is known.  \nFurther, you are given some finite (large) sample from the prng. If  \nthe sample is one-dimensional, we can apply the cdf to it and test  \nthe sample for being realizations of i.i.d. U[0,1]-random variables.  \nHowever, my problem is, that the sample is not one-dimensional but  \nmultidimensional (say I have 10000 observations from the prng where  \neach observation is 100 dimensional). How can I test the prng?\nOne idea would be to apply the known cdf to the data to obtain a one- \ndimensional sample, but the corresponding theoretical distribution  \nfunction (often called 'probability integral transform') is also not  \nknown. Is there a simple way (or any way) to test such a prng? Most  \npapers I found deal with the standard uniform case, which is of  \ncourse easy to test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, ...).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMarius\n\nm_hofert@web.de\n\nPS: Sorry, this question is not directly related to R, but I hope you  \ncan help me anyway.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
