Alternatively, you\ncould just have the source code present on the machine itself if you\ndidn't provide media at all.\n \nUsing a written offer for source is also possible, but it means that\nyou have to keep around the source code for three years; by including\nit with the computer, you can ship it and forget it. [This is one\nreason why Debian has the source code for all of main on the same\nservers that the binary packages are served from.]\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nDropping non-free would set us back at least, what, 300 packages? It'd\ntake MONTHS to make up the difference, and meanwhile Debian users will\nbe fleeing to SLACKWARE.\n\nAnd what about SHAREHOLDER VALUE? \n -- Matt Zimmerman in \n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
