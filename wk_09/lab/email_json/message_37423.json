I'd like to learn more about it.\n\nThere are some docs on wiki.samba.org, such as:\n\n  http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CTDB_Setup\n  http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CTDB_Project\n\nbut they are a bit out of date now. We will be working to improve them\nover the next few weeks. CTDB has come a long way in the last month or\nso. \n\nRonnie started doing some wiki updates over the weekend, but there is\na bit more to do.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
