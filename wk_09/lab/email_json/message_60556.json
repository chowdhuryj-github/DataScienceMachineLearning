Chat works on sugar jhbuild, and\nrequires a relatively up to date sugar and presenceservice (certainly\nnewer than build 406 if you are running on an XO or emulation).\n\n> I am trying to learn the code of the chat-activity to reuse some of the\n> models for a multiplayer portion of a learning game I am working on.

For more\nsophisticated collaboration, we have D-Bus tubes, which allow signals\nand method calls.\n\nSee projects/hellomesh in git for an example of tubes.\n\nAsk if you need help :)\n\nRegards\nMorgan\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
