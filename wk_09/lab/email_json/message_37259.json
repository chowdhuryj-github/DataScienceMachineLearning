I text someone who uses\nFedora with my questions but she might be busy as she still hasn't got\nback to me on my latest messages and not being Visually Impaired she\nmight not know the answer anyway as she mo9stly uses the KDE\nenvironment.\nHope someone can answer my question about the modified Fedora as I\ntried to run Lynx with Orca from the Gnome terminal but I had problems\ntracking the text on pages as it seems to repeat lines so far down\npages so it tries to read other stuff it has already read and I didn't\nhave much luck with w3m as the hotkeys don't seem to be verry clear or\nthey are assigned for a Japaneese rather than UK keyboard and I seemed\nunable to enter forms using it because when I typed in the text field\nit tried to activate commands.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
