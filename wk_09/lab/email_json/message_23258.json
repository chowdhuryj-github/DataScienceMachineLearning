There will\n  be a few more minor changes  but right now I'm\n  not inclined to do another RC4 in spite of the\n  rather large diff between 3.0.25rc3 and the\n  release tree.  Release is planned for May 14.\n\n* The SAMBA_3_0_26 svn branch has been created and is\n  now open for general developer churn.  The tree will\n  be open for major changes until June 4.  After that\n  we'll start locking down and moving towards a\n  stable release in July.\n\n* The SAMBA_3_0_26.bzr svn mirror has been pushed out\n  to the normal place http://www.samba.org/~jerry/bzr/\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGO6kzIR7qMdg1EfYRAu8oAKDPHvb34cUcunldlx7AJauk/tLdAACgzjE/\nMX66e6KodJ6WHRsc94VIWXc=\n=R8kc\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
