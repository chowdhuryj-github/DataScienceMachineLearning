There have been a number of copyright complaints\nfiled (in Germany and the US) over GPLed software.  The GPL's copyleft\nnature did not bar those lawsuits.  I am not aware of any that went to\ntrial in the US, but at least one German lawsuit alleging GPL\nviolations was decided[1] for the licensor, and other cases (in both\ncountries) have settled with the defendant agreeing to comply with the\nGPL.\n\n[1]- http://www.gpl-violations.org/news/20060922-dlink-judgement_frankfurt.html\n\n> The requirement in copyleft to provide source code can\n> also be seen as a fee--in fact, this has been cited as a reason for\n> considering the GPLv2 valid, enforcible and non- discriminatory with\n> respect to anti-trust law.\n\nThat unattributed \"has been cited\" reads like a poor appeal to an\nindefinite authority.  Daniel Wallace's failed anti-trust lawsuit\n_cited_ such provisions as reasons to consider the GPLv2 invalid,\nunenforceable and an unlawful conspiracy with respect to anti-trust\nlaw.  We can see how far making that claim got him.\n\n(Incidentally, neither the district court's ruling[2] to dismiss\nWallace's complaint, nor the appeals court's order[3] upholding\ndismissal, treat the requirement to provide source code as a fee.  To\nthe contrary, their orders seem to view it primarily as a benefit to\nthe end user and to the software community.\n\n[2]- http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/WallaceFSFGrantingDismiss.pdf\n[3]- http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=06-2454_008.pdf\n)\n\nWhile there is a fairly broad range of what people on this list think\nis a \"fee\", in the end, providing source code for software that one\ndistributes has never been considered a fee.  Giving up tangible\nproperty, actions unrelated to software (such as petting a cat) and\nintellectual property unrelated to the software in question (such as\nover-broad patent defense clauses) have been considered fees.\nConcessions necessary to exercise software freedoms have not.\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
