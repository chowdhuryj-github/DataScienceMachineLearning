After a bit of fiddling, I\nmanaged to get what I wanted.\n\nhadley wickham wrote:\nh> You might want to read the introductory chapters in the ggplot book,\nh> available from http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, which will give you more of a\nh> background.  Please let me know places where you think the\nh> documentation is inconsistent so I can try and make them better.\nI already did. :) A general problem: the examples are nice and easy to\nget, but it's often hard to apply them to my own specific problem.\nIt's more a problem of the general structure: what has to go where.\nMost of the methods are using qplot, but what do I have to do if I'm\ntrying create a more complex plot. Hmm, it's hard to describe.\n\nExample: I know how I set the title when using qplot (qplot(....\nmain=\"asdf\"). Where do I have to put it when I'm using gplot? Stuff\nlike this is unclear...\n\nA more general problem is, that the manual pages are very, eh,\nminimalistic documented. The overall reference page is good and nicely\nstructured. But the big idea is sort of missing. All components are\nlinked, but the basics like layout, ggplot, aes etc are harder to find\n- and their help pages are the shortest. Especially the small details\nare hard to figure out. Lists of attributes etc..\n\nHmm, I know this is not really helpful. I can't describe my problems\nproperly, I guess. Perhaps the documentation simply has to improve\nbased on users questions. :\\\n\nHow old is this package? I think it's really, really great, but are\nthere many users? Is there an additional mailinglist or forum where I\ncan get more information?\n\nSome more questions:\n\nWhy doesn't ggplot2 work with layout()? I'm using viewport now, which\nworks fine for me, but there should be a note in the docs perhaps.\n\nHow do I change the legend. The auto-creation of it might be nice,\nbut I want a) to add a title b) change the order to ascending and c)\nadd a short description like:\n\n  DeltaConfig\n  [ ] 0 best\n  [ ]\n  [ ] 5\n  [ ]\n  [ ]10 worst\n\nI don't know if this is possible, but it would be nice to explain what\nthe colors/values might mean if it's not clear from the beginning\n(ligke diamonds.size). The only thing I found was the attribute\nlegend.justifcation in ggopt, which isn't fully documented.\n\nAdditionally, how can I change the order of the facets? I currently\nhave a plot with a smoother for each model (all in the same plot),\nwhich sorts the models like this: dyn,dl4,dl3 Below that, I have a\nfacet with point-plots for each model which sorts them the other way\nround, which is a bit confusing.\n\nBTW, what's the \"strip\" and the associated attributes?\n\nAgain, I think this package is great - nice work! All the above isn't\nmeant as general critisism, but is being said in order to improve the\ndocumentation..\n\nThanks in advance\nArne\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
