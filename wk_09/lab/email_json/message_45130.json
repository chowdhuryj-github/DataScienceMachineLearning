Hosting sites must also make money\nin some way, in order to pay for equipment costs. This can be quite\nreasonable, but is not \"costless\".\n\nThere are two classes of ways to do this commercially -- various\nsubscription/fee based schemes (costs charged directly to downloader)\nand various advertising-based schemes (costs covered by related\nactivities which benefit from the same communications channels).\n\nOne of the reasons why it is better not to use \"non-commercial\" licenses\nis because they rule out both methods for hosting nodes to make any\nrevenue from the distribution process, which means that these\ndistributed costs can't be covered.\n\nCheers,\nTerry\n\n-- \nTerry Hancock (hancock@AnansiSpaceworks.com)\nAnansi Spaceworks http://www.AnansiSpaceworks.com\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
