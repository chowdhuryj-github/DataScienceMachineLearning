I'm\nhaving ~200 datapoints on the x-axis, each has 10 records. I'm\ncurrently plotting only the mean value of each of the datapoints.\n\nWhat I need is a way to visualize the quartiles/error/whatever of\nthese points. I thought about boxplots, but I have to many points on\nthe xaxis - it would be impossible to see anything. I though that it\nwould be nice to have a \"hull\" around each line, indicate the width of\nthe quartiles, visualized by a different background. It's like a very\nwide boxplot with a changing mean value...\n\nIs this possible with r? Does anyone know what I mean and/or has done\nthis before?\n\nThanks\nArne\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
