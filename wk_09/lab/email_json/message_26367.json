Through\nthis tunnel I need to make a second SFTP connection for data transfer.\n\nI've been looking at Net::SSH, but I haven't quite figured out how to\nuse it to set up the initial tunnel, or even if it's possible with this\nmodule. Before I invest too much time, I thought I should find out if\nanyone else has already invented this particular wheel :)\n\nSo...\n\nHas anyone else done this? What modules should I be looking at?\nAny tidbits or advice to put me on the right path would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\nrichf\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
