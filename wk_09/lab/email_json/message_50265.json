I don't know whether the Speakup code should be rewritten or not, but it sure does seem that, as with much else, non-visual access is very much an afterthought at best for the makers of Linux kernels.  \n\nAl\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Zachary Kline\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Monday, June 18, 2007 12:30 AM\nSubject: An apology\n\n\n> Hello,\n>     I would like to apologize for my recent tone on this mailing list.  The topic of Speakup support being taken out of Gentoo sources was, I suppose, a rather sensative one for me.  I have had a great deal of success with it.\n>     The irony in all this, I suppose, is that I recently switched away from Gentoo-sources and took up Vanilla-sources.  This was because the CVS version of Speakup used in Gentoo-sources has problems with my synthesizer: problems fixed by my manual patching in of a more recent version.\n>     I am confedent that in time we can work out a solution.  I'm not a technical person in a lot of ways: far be it from me to say what will work best.  I was rather strident in defending my points, and that wasn't called for.  Deedra, in particular, I apologize for beating a dead horse and not being more far-sighted.  \n>     I'd hope something can be decided upon which will satisfy everybody here.  Maybe a complete rewrite of Speakup is called for, I don't know.  \n> I remain, nevertheless, yours,\n> Zachary Kline.\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n> \n> \n> -- \n> No virus found in this incoming message.\n> Checked by AVG Free Edition. \n> Version: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.9.0/852 - Release Date: 6/17/2007 8:23 AM\n> \n> \n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
