So let me get right to your reading, so I can explain everything to you.\nI see the four Mystical Milestones ofthe ancient \"Passageway of Power\" in your destiny...\nMONEY, LOVE, HEALTH and JOY\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this reading, I will explain what I saw and what it could mean for you...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A person is walking down a long stone corridor. A beam of light comes from a distant window...just enough to softly illuminate magnificent tapestries lining the walls. Up ahead, a dark figure, a Guide, slowly and gently motions the individual to come forward. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, I want you to envision yourself as this person...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you progress further along the passageway, a large oak door appears to one side. Etched in stone on the wall just beside the door are odd-looking symbols from a long-lost alphabet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You try to push the bronze latch on the handle, but it is locked. Your Guide extends an open hand to you. In it is a glowing, Golden Key, shining brightly in the dark, and as you will see, this Key has special, magical powers...\u00a0\nWhat is extraordinary about this vision?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, I realized that this was no ordinary corridor and that this vision was all about discovering the incredible powers you carry within you and the astonishing possibilities\u00a0June 22nd, 2007\u00a0holds for your Destiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You see, the stone floor, tapestries, bronze detail and especially the strange signs on the wall were my tip that you were roaming the inner pathways of the sacred Runic Passageway of Power. Because I recognized that the symbols were in fact Runes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Nordic Dynasties of the medieval period built a prosperous, thriving civilization, rich with lore, including the magical Runes, symbols derived from the Romans and used extensively by the Nordic Peoples to attract good fortune and ward off bad luck.\nThe Runes etched into the stone wall included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nordic warriors used the runes to ensure victory in battle. Along with the Runes, astrology also played an important role in Nordic history and legend. In the year 1030 A.D., the Patron Saint of Norway, King Olaf, charged into battle just as the Sun went into a total eclipse, and ultimately Norway's independence was won.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, just as the great Nordic Kings looked to the stars and the Runes for the key to their ultimate destiny, the forces favoring you on June 22nd, 2007 will bring you the greatest power and benefits from the Four Mystical Milestones of the ancient \"Passageway of Power\"...Money, Love, Health, and Joy.\nA whole new world of wealth and poweris opening up for you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And because I want you to be able to take full advantage of every opportunity that will come to you, I want to give you this free gift:\n\n\u00a0\nTHIS IS THE KEY -- THAT WILL UNLOCK YOUR FUTURE\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This specially energized key will concentrate and focus the positive energy that is now building around you. (Caution: You may feel a tingle when wearing it.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you look closely at it, you will see the deeply inscribed Runes. I had the key plated for you in Gold to protect its power and purity. (Gold, one of the basic elements, cannot be corroded or corrupted in any way by anything.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as you receive this key, I want you to wear it or keep it close to you 24 hours a day.\nOpen the door, Memo, to a new world of riches, happiness, health and success!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remember, in the vision you and your Guide were standing before a door. The crucial thing for you to keep in mind is that every door represents an amazing opportunity for you to gain wealth, happiness, health and success.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You insert the Golden Key in the great oaken door. The tumblers of the lock give way, with a sound like coins shaking in a can. You open the door to an enormous chamber filled with sunlight. All around the room are rare, valuable antiques, jewelry, and chests filled with golden coins and treasure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of the items glimmer and gleam, while others have become tarnished, dull and dusty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawn to the collection of goods in one corner of the room, you recognize certain items. To your astonishment, you find a favorite toy you played with as a child. On a set of shelves nearby is every gift you have ever given, including those you later regretted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one chest is all the money you have ever spent...in another all that you have ever lost through waste, bad investments, or impulsive spending. The coins and bills in these chests are tarnished and faded but still good.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further ahead, you come upon an array of sparkling, brand new items, jewelry and watches, treasure chests filled with gold, stacks of cash, amounting to millions upon millions of dollars.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you browse, the items get bigger, as does the room...soon you see beautiful, luxurious furniture, an enormous yacht...and just outside the window, a huge mansion on a hill, with a glimmering pond before it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A car pulls up in front of the mansion. It is a silver Jaguar with the license plate  8 8 72 -- (your birthday, Memo!). Beautifully-dressed people climb out of the car, and you recognize them too. They are the members of your family.\nMemo, you can live like a King!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You may not know this, Memo, but when the Great Kings of the medieval Nordic Dynasty passed on, they were buried with all their riches, property, even medicine and food -- everything they would need to begin a new life with their health, youthful energy and most precious possessions restored to them. And their dearest loved ones would ultimately join them in this new, higher state of existence: A Paradise of Riches, Love, and Renewed Health.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can't believe what a perfect sign this is! For, like the greatest Kings of the Nordic Dynasties, you too are about to begin a whole new life. And as you discover the wealth of powers you possess with you, your entire world will become new to you, and you will want for nothing! Even your loved ones will benefit from the transformation you are about to have.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't you see? This is exactly what I am trying to tell you! You can live like a king! And I'm going to show you exactly how you can make this reality come true in your life!\nTogether, we can break through the veilconcealing the true causes of your problems!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In your journey through the Passageway of Power, your rediscovery of all your property represents the past, present and future of your life -- the gains, losses, your successes and the failures, your strengths and weaknesses ... and the possibility of a future filled with riches, love and unimaginable happiness!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even those items that have been lost forever are still invaluable...because each one represents an experience that offers you a precious nugget of wisdom. It's human nature to be afraid to look at our losses, but to do so is to turn your back on the possibilities of gaining treasures beyond your wildest dreams!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is what I was talking about at the very beginning of this letter -- the power of negative energy to surround you and cut you off from your best opportunities to succeed and find the money, love and dazzling health!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You see, Memo, negativity and failure affect everyone. But the most successful people take their setbacks in stride. They don't ignore them...instead they learn from them and focus as much of their time, effort and talents on their greatest strengths.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you can do the same! I'll show you how to turn negatives into positives and positives into a constantly multiplying windfall of prosperity!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, starting June 22nd, 2007\u00a0you will have an extraordinary opportunity to absolutely neutralize the negative energies around you and take control of your own destiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now, you can bring the transformative powers of the Passageway of Power into your life in a real, concrete and lasting way. I'm going to give you everything you need in:\n\"THE GOLDEN KEY TO YOUR PERSONAL POWER\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This incredible document will tell you exactly what you need to know to free the extraordinary life-giving force within you!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, it's true! You do have a powerful force within you.
