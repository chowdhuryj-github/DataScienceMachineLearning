But\nincl.\nthe list of shares as part of the advertisement involves adding TXT records\nto\nthe advertisement and not all clients may lookup the advertised TXT records.\nOn OS X and on the new airport extreme base station the smb service is\nadvertised and clients query the server for the list of shares.\n\nRishi\n\n"}
