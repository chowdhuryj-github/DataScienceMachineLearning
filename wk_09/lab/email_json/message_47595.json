However, if your variable is, say, the 50-th\namino acid in a certain gene (with values of 1 for the\nfirst amino acid, 2 for the second one,...,20 for the\n20-th one) then your variable is really categorical\n(you generally can not say that amino acid 2 is much\ncloser to amino acid 3 than to amino acid 17).  In\nsuch a case I would have tried classification method\nwhich can treat categorical variables or,\nalternatively,  may be regression trees (i.e. split on\nthe values of categorical variables and at each \"node\"\nfind regression coefficients of the continuous\nvariables).\n\nRegards,\n\nMoshe Olshansky\nm_olshansky@yahoo.com\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
