Dr Siriwat said Abbott had told the FDA that it\nfound the offer unacceptable.\n\nHe said, however, that representatives of MSD and Sanofi-Aventis,\npatent-holders of Efavirenz and the heart drug Plavix, are expected to\nattend the meeting.\n\nThe session will be the second round of meetings.\n\nThe first round, which was held late last month, ended inconclusively as\nthe pharmaceutical firms told negotiators they had to discuss the matter\nwith their parent companies.\n\nPreviously, the FDA had informed the patent holders that the state was\nwilling to compensate them with only 0.5% of the revenue generated from\nthe generic drug sales. This was in keeping with Article 51 of the\npatent law, he said.\n\nThe Public Health Ministry issued compulsory licences in November and\nearly January to produce or import generic versions of the costly drugs\nfor emergency use in the country.\n\nHowever, Abbott bluntly rejected any offer, claiming such a state policy\nwould only jeopardise its research and development plans for new drugs.\nThe US-based drug company earlier opposed the government's decision to\ngo for compulsory licensing and threatened to withhold the introduction\nof new drugs here, including an improved version of Kaletra.\n\nIn February, the drug company made an offer during a meeting with senior\nhealth officials at the Disease Control Department to cut the price of\nKaletra used at state hospitals from 11,580 baht per patient per month\nto lower than 4,000 baht. There has been no further discussion on the offer.\n\n\"The state has to be responsible for all patients suffering from\nHIV/Aids and heart disease, while the private firms have to stick to the\nprinciple of profit making. Our standpoints are different. That's why we\nhave to discuss this to seek the most acceptable solution for both\nsides,\" said Dr Siriwat.\n\nKaletra's global sales total US$1.1 billion (41.8 billion baht) annually.\n\nHowever, the FDA secretary-general said he was not worried about\nresolute standpoint and that health officials were looking for other\noptions of pharmaceutical products made by the company.\n\nRepresentatives of both MSD and Sanofi have told the FDA all their\ndecisions would come from discussions with their mother companies.\n\nSo far, MSD has offered to reduce the price of Efavirenz to 726 baht per\nbottle, but the government can buy the generic version of the\nanti-retroviral treatment from India at just 650 baht per bottle.\n\nSanofi-Aventis, however, has offered a \"special package\" for the heart\ndisease drug to respond to the government's policy of extending access\nto medicines, and a special quota of 3.4 million tablets of Plavix for\n34,000 patients in Thailand.\n\nDr Siriwat said the government also planned to ask Novartis to reduce\nthe price of Gleevec, a leukaemia treatment, instead of adopting a\nphilanthropic programme in order to genuinely extend drug access for\npatients suffering from cancer.\n\n--\nMike Palmedo\nResearch Coordinator\nProgram on Information Justice and Intellectual Property\nAmerican University, Washington College of Law\n4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016\nT - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659\nmpalmedo@wcl.american.edu\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
