My question is that I have a class like below definition:\n\nsetClass(\"DBManager\", \n   representation(channel=\"RODBC\"))\n\nMy purpose of the conn slot is to hold a channel to database connection which is returned by a command like:\n\nchannel <- odbcConnect(\"DB\", uid=\"user\", pwd=\"password\")\n\nAccording to RODBC documentation, this channel is supposed to have a type of \"RODBC\". However, if I declare my class as above, R will complain that it does not know about \"RODBC\" type or class. Please clarify. Thank you.\n\n- adschai \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
