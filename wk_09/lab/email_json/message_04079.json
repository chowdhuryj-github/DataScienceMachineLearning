First, I've tried a few different distros on this critter, \nand here's the thing...\nI can get grml to boot, but, it doesn't pick up the doubletalk when I \nspecify it to the grml prompt, however, when I am finished booting, and \necho it to /proc/speakup/synth_name, it comes right up.\nSo, I thought I'd try it with slackware, and no dice, even after the \nboot process completes, I know it completes because I can run the eject \ncommand and it releases the cd from the drive.  Is this a bios problem, \nor is there someplace else I should be looking?  By the way, I did get \nthe 6.1 ubuntu to work too, but I like my text console better just \nnow... any help would be most welcome, as I'm running xp right now, I \nkinda' liked it when I found out that xp won't even see a linux \npartition so now I know that when I reinstall it on this beast I can do \na duel-boot on it and use it to test the linux version of Audio Quake \nand still play my winders-based games too...\nThanks much!\n\n-- \nEmail services by FreedomBox.
