I know of pl/r, which accomplishes the\nlatter, but has yet to be successfully ported to Windows.  Similarly,\nI've tried to use Rdbi and DBI, but I haven't had luck with those on\nWindows either for connecting to PostgreSQL from R.  Can anyone suggest\na solution for this?\n\nIt would seem that rgdal could also help me in this case. Unfortunately,\nthe version of the GDAL library that is included in the rdgal binary\navailable on CRAN (for windows) doesn't include the PostgreSQL driver\nfor OGR (i.e., it's not listed by the ogrDrivers() function).\n\nI compiled rgdal on Windows myself using the GDAL library from\nFWTools-1.3.1, but I was unsuccessful at creating a proper binary\npackage for R.  I was only able to get it to work by substituting the\nrgdal.dll that was installed by CRAN with the one that I compiled that\nlinks against the GDAL library from FWTools.  Even though it works (at\nfirst glance with ogrInfo(), and readOGR()), I still get a warning\nmessage when I load the libary: \"DLL attempted to change FPU control\nword from 8001f to 9001f\".\n\nSo my question with respect to rgdal is a) is it likely that an rgdal\npackage is going to be released in the future with the PostgreSQL driver\nincluded in GDAL/OGR, or b) are there any suggestions/instructions that\nmight get me through the compilation and packaging process for rgdal\nwith better success?\n\nThanks in advance for any help,\nMike\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
