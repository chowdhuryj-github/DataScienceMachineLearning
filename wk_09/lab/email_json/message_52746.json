But if we\nget to the state where core Perl 6 is ready to unleash on the world as a\nstable release, but it's still the case that:\n\n* The OO documentation, while readable and complete, if given a little\n  more structure would be better for computer parsing.\n\n* We haven't finalized the Web module.\n\n* There isn't a fully working Perl 6 implementation of 'Duke Nukem\n  Forever' in the examples/ subdirectory.\n\n... then I don't think it would be worth holding up Perl 6.0.0.'s\nrelease to wait for any of those things to happen.\n\nSmylers\n\n"}
