Is there an easy way to install (or load, if that's the easier way) those packages under 2.5.0, without having to install each package by hand?\n\nI'm not sure if this counts as installing \"by hand\", but (assuming you \nhave a network connection) you can use the menu system to see the list \nof CRAN packages, and install the ones you want from there.  If you have \nsome of your own non-CRAN packages, \"Install package from local .zip \nfile\" allows multiple files to be selected and installed.\n\nThe only combination that's not so easy is installing from source \n.tar.gz files, but a shell command to loop over *.tar.gz could probably \nbe written.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
