I am the maintainer and found the bug.\n\nIn the 'epitab' function:\n\n    if (method == \"oddsratio\") {\n    ...\n        else {\n            fin <- list(tab = tab, measure = oddsratio, \n                  conf.level = conf.level, pvalue = pvalue, )\n        }\n\n\nThe comma should not be after the second \"pvalue\". You can correct this\nin your local workspace. I will correct and upload new package. \n\nTomas\n\n\n=======\nTomas Aragon, MD, DrPH\nTel: 510-847-9139 (mobile)\nWeb: http://www.medepi.net/aragon\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
