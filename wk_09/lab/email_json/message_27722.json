Is your position that there shouldbe separate attributes, 'nick' which you can change, and 'name' whichyou can't? Is there any design in which this is documented? In theabsence of any particular reference, I'd been assuming the codeimplements the design.\n> We must never depend on> just color/nick/avatar in the UI to identify people; their name, as we> have it stored, must always be displayed alongside their mutable> identifier.\nSo something like, the tooltip when you hover over an XO shows you theirnick, avatar and stored name?\n|-------------------||     SMcV          |   <-- nick chosen by user|-------------------|| Simon McVittie    |   <-- not present in the current implementation|  AAAAA            ||  AAAAA            |   <-- AAAA = avatar|  AAAAA            ||-------------------|| (+) Add as friend ||-------------------|_______________________________________________Sugar mailing listSugar@laptop.orghttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
