Excel handles 256. \n\nActually my problem is now a SAS one where I can get a\nclean csv export but lose the variable labels.  My\ncrude workaround was just to do a proc contents and\ncut-and-paste the results.  A  pain but it worked.  \n\nI've got to figure out why I cannot get Hmisc to work!\n\n\nThanks for the suggestion.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
