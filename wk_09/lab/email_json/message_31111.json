The function version is easier to debug \nwith a debugger (should that ever be necessary), makes for a (possibly) \nsmaller object file, and can be inlined by a smart optimizing compiler \nanyway.  For such a trivial function, these are all rather trivial \ndifferences, but you still might as well get rid of the macro.\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
