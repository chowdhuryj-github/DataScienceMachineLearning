Some proactive\n              organizations have identified and implemented strategies and tactics to meet these challenges. Knowledge retention\n              programs and joint efforts with local colleges and universities are underway. Enhanced recruitment and retention\n              programs are also being developed to fill the workforce with employees that represent the communities they serve. \n\u00a0\nUtilities recognize the challenges and opportunities of the changing demographics. Those utilities that implement a\n                      strategic diversity process will be able to create a strong, high-performing organization. These companies are making\n                      a business case to manage and leverage diversity by linking it to their organizational business plan. Leadership\u2019s true\n                      understanding of, and commitment to diversity and inclusion sets the strategic direction for the organization and is key to\n                      success. Leadership must transition from diversity as a program to an integral component of daily business operations. \n\u00a0\nDiversity and inclusion are not only key from a workforce perspective, but from a community and marketplace perspective\n                      as well. Work with community organizations through volunteer efforts or foundation funding become essential\n                      components of the extension into the service area community. As one tactic, Supplier Diversity also enhances the\n                      economic development within the community and demonstrates good corporate citizenship.\n\u00a0 \nThis conference will provide insight into the unique path utilities are taking towards a high-performing, diverse and\n                      inclusive workforce culture. Starting with some of the basic components of a diversity process, and working through\n                      examples from existing programs that are thriving, this conference will highlight the initiatives that generate inclusiveness\n                      as a key to utilities successfully competing in the marketplace.\n\u00a0\nWho Should Attend:\n\u00a0\nUtility CEOs, vice presidents and managers interested in creating or promoting diversity efforts in their organization\n\n Human resource and diversity professionals interested in learning more about diversity programs in the utility industry\n Diversity consultants who would like to learn more about efforts in the utility industry\n Non-profit foundation managers wanting to become more involved in the diversity efforts of the organization\n Other managers who will be working with the utilities emerging diverse workforce:\n                        \n Generation, T&D operations/maintenance/construction\n Strategic planning\n IT\n Marketing\n Communication\n Staffing and recruitment\n Community and public relations\n Career development\n Employee training\n Organizational development\n Power operations\n Customer service\n Supplier Diversity programs \n\n\n\nWhy Attend?\n\u00a0\nSeveral factors are coming together to change the nature of the utility\u2019s workforce.
