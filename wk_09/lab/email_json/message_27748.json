In the past I have generated \npredicted probabilities based on the sample asked wording 1, used these to \nassign those asked wording 2 to predicted categories, and used a logistic \nregression to predict difference between predicted and actual response. In \nthis case, though, the question of interest uses a four-level ordinal \nresponse, so ordinary predicted probabilities based on, e.g., and ordinal \nlogistic regression generate literally probabilities of being in each of \nthe four categories. Transforming this outcome into a prediction of \nmembership in one of the given categories is not straightforward. Can \nanyone provide some insight into how to model predicted vs. actual \noutcomes on an ordinal scale?\n\nThanks.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAndrew J Perrin - andrew_perrin (at) unc.edu - http://perrin.socsci.unc.edu\nAssistant Professor of Sociology; Book Review Editor, _Social Forces_\nUniversity of North Carolina - CB#3210, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3210 USA\nNew Book: http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/178592.ctl\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
