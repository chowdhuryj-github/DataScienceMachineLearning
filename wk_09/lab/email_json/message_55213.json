I already have the script, only it's \ncopied from a Firefox session in Windows.  Wonder if I should download \nthe other, or just create sym-links.  Decisions, decisions.  Do you know \nof a similar stdin/out filter akin to htm2txt?  Was thinking of having \nprocmail pass everything through that prior to delivery, killing off any \nquestionable java code.  Hell.  Might as well just pass anything with \njava in it to /dev/nul.   I figure anyone wanting to take control \nof my system that badly isn't exactly the friendly type.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
