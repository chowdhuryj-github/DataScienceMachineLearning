", "body": "  Hi Amanda!  It looks like you are using the wrong module for the\nSblive Value card.  It should be snd-emu10k1, not snd-emu10k1x.  The\nsnd-emu10k1x module is for the Dell Creative Labs card, a crummy\nsoftware driven version of the sblive card.  Under Linux, it is not\nmulti channel, and in my experience is most unsatisfactory.  The sblive\nvalue card on the other hand, is a wonderful multi channel sound card. \nJust make sure you are using the correct module, and I think your\nproblems will disappear.\n\nGene\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
