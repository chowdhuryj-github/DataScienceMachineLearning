As you may expect, he only knows Microsoft Windblows, so \nwhen he saw a Linux login terminal, he shut the system down the hard way \nbecause he could not figure out how to get back into it.\nSo, I reinstalled a clone of my working Gateway computer, and because of the \nhardware, Windows XP is actually stable, most of the time believe it or \nnot.Now, would it be possible to use VMWare worksation and run Linux and \nisntall it, and use software speech with Speakup? Any considerations that I \nshould take into account first? Will this work? Let me know.
