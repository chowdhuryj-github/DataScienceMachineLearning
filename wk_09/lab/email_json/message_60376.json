In the example for ipop function, the matrix A includes only variable y. However, in Support Vector Regression formulation, we have these constraints:\n   \n  y-f(x)+b<=e\n  f(x)+b-y<=e\n   \n  How vector y does correspond to the matrix A in this formulation? \n   \n  How can we include the constant b of above constraints in ipop? \n   \n  In the first term of objective function (according to the kernlab package document), variable x should correspond to slack variables by means of SVR formulation. However, in the rest of the objective function (quadratic term) , variable x corresponds to w in SVR formulation. Therefore, as far as I understand x corresponds to two variables. Or what is my missing?\n   \n   \n  I thank you so much for your guids. I'm not an expert in this area. Please help me to understand ipop.\n   \n  with the best regards,\n  T.
