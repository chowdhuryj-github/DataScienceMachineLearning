Don't use shading lines.  These were mainly used when color/grayscale\nwas not available and are less needed now.  Also, sometimes the used of\nshading lines causes a Moire vibration (the combination of the lines and\nthe physiology of the eye give the illusion of movement) which makes the\ngraph harder to read (see Tufte).\n\n2. polygon (and friends) generally do either shading or color, but not\nboth.  When doing shading they use the color specified by par('fg'), so\nyou can set par(fg='red'), plot the polygon, then change the forground\ncolor back to black (or whatever it was).  If you want the outline of\nthe polygon black, just plot another polygon (without density or color\narguments) over the top of the red one.\n\n3. create your plot they way you do now (with the wrong color), then use\nthe plot2script function in the TeachingDemos package to get the low\nlevel commands that were used to create the plot.  Find the segments\nfunctions and change the color from red to black (you will also need to\nremove the extra arguments from the box and polygon functions) then\nrerun the entire created script.  This option is inferior to the 2 above\nunless you want really detailed control of the final plot, or really\nwant to see the details that go into creating the plot.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
