I find I am having problems\nstill even after adjusting for that. Using other data it is not accepting\nthe estimation of beta.start with maximum likelihood\n(\"user.prior.density(beta.start) <= 0\") and it is obliging me to specify it\ngiving me a very narrow range, and hence the acceptance rate of the output\nis very mediocre (0.01)... I don't know I am missing something here maybe.\nAs much as I was excited about the MCMCpack, I am finding that it is no\nsubstitute for BUGS/Brugs.\n\n\nCody_Hamilton wrote:\n> \n> Dear Franco,\n> \n> Have you tried using the beta.start option in MCMClogit?
