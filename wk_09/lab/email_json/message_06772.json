RPS is the term for legislation which mandates\n        that power suppliers obtain a percentage of their power mix from\n        renewable resources. It is estimated that investment in renewable\n        energy has increased by 25% in 2006 alone. This figure is said\n        to be due in part to renewable portfolio standards.\n To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have adopted\n        RPS or similar green power market policies that require utilities\n        to supply a certain percentage of electricity from specified renewable\n        energy technologies. Some RPS specify the technology mix, while\n        others leave it up to the market allowing variables like cost,\n        availability and reliability to enter the decision making process.\n Typically an energy supplier has a choice of how to fulfill the\n        RPS mandate using a combination of renewable energy sources combined\n        with flexible, market-based mechanisms. In the wake of policy implementation\n        utility suppliers must plan for RPS compliance using mechanisms\n        like Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) or Renewable Energy Certificates\n        (REC). Many states that have not formally adopted an RPS are either\n        currently considering one,or a similar alternative policy. Renewable\n        electricity supply policy warrants careful understanding because\n        of the multi-faceted implications for regulatory compliance and\n        business development.\n\n Learn about renewable portfolio diversity\n Understand market and policy drivers behind renewable development\n Understand utility options for RPS compliance\n Understand the utility\u2019s role in the policy creation\n          process\n Get tips for successful program implementation for RPS compliance\n Learn how to generate and purchase renewable energy certificates\n          (RECs)\n Hear about innovative green power marketing programs \n\n\n\nRegister Today!\n\u00a0\nWhat Past Attendees Have Said :\n\u201cTargeted key issues facing the RPS emerging markets from\n        financing projects to market development.\u201d\n        ~N.P., Conservation Services Group\n \u201cIn a world of information overload, a single conference\n        with diverse subject experts, helps to paint a clearer picture\n        of that subject.\u201d\n        ~J.L., Con Ed Development\n\u201cThe conference was very informative...a very diverse group\n        of presenters\u201d\n        ~E.E., Primmer Piper Eggleston & Cramer PC\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\nUpcoming \nConferences\n\n\nOutsourcing For \n\t\t\tUtilities\nChicago, IL\n            April 17-18, 2007\n\nMarketing \n\t\t\tGreen Power\nChicago, IL\n            April 19-20, 2007\n\nFundamentals \n\t\t\tof Distribution Engineering\nAtlanta, GA\n            April 19-20, 2007\n\nSox-101 for \n\t\t\tElectric, Gas and Water Utilities ...
