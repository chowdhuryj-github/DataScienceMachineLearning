I'm wondering if this package would be appropriate for things like essays, with fairly specific formatting requirements.  (I could always use a Windows word processor to do the same, but I get less feedback with those than I feel comfortable with.)\nIf this is indeed the case, could anybody recommend a good site for learning the fundamentals?  I've heard of a publication called the TeXbook, but can't find an accessible version.\nThanks much in advance,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
