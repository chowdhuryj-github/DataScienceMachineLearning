It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.\n\nTo have what we want is riches but to be able to do without is power.\n\n\nThe end of life is life. Life is action, the use of one's powers. And to use them to their height is our joy of duty.\n\nStill bent to make some port he knows not where, still standing for some false impossible shore.\n\nThe Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.\n\nHonor is like an island, rugged and without a beach once we have left it, we can never return.\n\nI used to trouble about what life was for -- now being alive seems sufficient reason.\n\nLife is pain and the enjoyment of love is an anesthetic.\n\nI would uphold the law if for no other reason but to protect myself.\n\nDo not on any account attempt to write on both sides of the paper at once.\n\nWhat men usually ask for when they pray to God is, that two and two may not make four.\n\nConstant success shows us but one side of the world adversity brings out the reverse of the picture.\n\n\n"}
