However, this assumes you  \nalready know what the problem is that needs fixed.  Without having  \naccess to the actual boot messages (not just the ones you see while  \nbooting into your sandbox as it were) you'll never be able to solve   \nany major problems that crop up in regards to the main system.\nit is however, not a bad idea, since it would allow some degree of  \nfree usage w/o sighted assistance on simple fixes.  it wouldn't  \naddress the  main issue though.\nAnd, in any case, it's functionally equivalent to the original  \nsuggestion of using a live cd to boot and work on fixing the issues  \nfrom there.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
