Unless there's some survey data or\nsomething to the contrary, I suspect most other rural Englishmen would.\nI'm a bit old-fashioned like that, which is why newspeak like \"You're\nforcing me to ...\" looks silly to me.\n\nMore generally, please cut non-native speakers some Slack about English\nuse when it matters like this.  If a German walks into your restaurant\nand says \"Please can I become a steak?\" then that is not justification\nfor killing and butchering him.  You know damn well what was meant.\n\n(The only non-native speakers who I won't cut slack are those who start\npreaching their interpretation of English as The One True Meaning over\nobjections from Englishmen. ;-) )\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
