By definition it is a *one* *way* grant *from* \nthe licensor. The \"choice of venue\" is a demand by the licensor for \nsomething back. Therefore any licence with a \"choice of venue\" clause \ncannot be a pure licence.\n\nOh - and the GPL does NOT \"demand anything back\", so there is no payment \n*to* *the* *licensor*.\n\nCheers,\nWol\n-- \nAnthony W.
