So far I tried pvclust (www.is.titech.ac.jp/~shimo/prog/*pvclust*\n/)\nbut I always had the problem like for R like \"cannot allocate the memory\".\n\nI am curious about what else packages can perform the clustering analysis\nwhile memory efficient.\n\nMeanwhile, is there any way that I can extract the features of each cluster.\n\nIn other words, I would like to identify which are responsible for\nclassifying these\nvariables (samples).\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlex\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
