I have a matrix of 20 variables (380000 observations each). I am trying to fit using \"2SLS\" in Systemfit because I want to be able to simulate new observations with the resulting model. The first problem I found is that it ran out of memory given that I have 2GB of RAM. How can I circumvent this? Can I do some mixing or bootstrapping with small sample each time instead?Another problem is I got system is computationally singular when I reduce the size of observation to 100000 instead of 380000. Any help would be appreciated. I think my variables are not really well correlated to that extent. adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
