I\nhaven't compared it to the solutions suggested here but would be surprised\nif any of them would substantially faster.\n\nAs for your time series, I would recommend that you hold it as a \"zoo\"\nseries with \"Date\" time stamps. See\n  vignette(\"zoo-quickref\", package = \"zoo\")\n  vignette(\"zoo\", package = \"zoo\")\nfor some examples of \"zoo\" series in general and na.locf() in particular.\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
