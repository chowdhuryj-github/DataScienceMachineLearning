Is there a function who can do this, or should I write a function\non my own.\n\nSorry, I'm sure it is a stupid question, but maybe someone can give me a\ngood reference for answers, because I am a beginner :-)\n\nThanks to everyone\nMario\n\n>\n>\n>> I hope anyone can help me.\n>>\n>> Regards Mario\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n>> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
