My variables include a number of covariates and a single random factor,\nbecause the experiment was laid out in blocks.  I'd like to have a statistic to\nmeasure the \"proportion of explained variance\" from my models.  With ordinary\nmultiple regression I'd use R-squared, but I can't find any similar items in\nthe output from lme().  Does anyone know something I can use in these or any\nother package?\n\nThanks,\n\nRichard.\n\n--\nRichard Gunton\nPhD student - Ecology and Evolution group\nSchool of Biology, University of Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK\nRoom 10.16, Miall Building   Tel: 0113 3432825\n\nhttp://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~bgyrg\n\n~ Opinions expressed in this message are not attributable to the University of\nLeeds ~\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
