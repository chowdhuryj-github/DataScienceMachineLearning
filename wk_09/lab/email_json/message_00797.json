Can we move this on dev.laptop.org and add it to jhbuild?\n\nSure. It's a continuation of the old chat-activity repository (though only\nsetup.py and the .svg are unchanged) so you should be able to pull it into the\nchat-activity repository already there. Presumably I'll need some sort of\naccount to push to dev.laptop.org.\n\n> Btw please do not use raw pixels to specify margin, padding etc. You can\n> use the sugar/graphics/units.py helpers to do conversion from points.
