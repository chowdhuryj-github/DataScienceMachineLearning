Can I have the browser run in full screen mode so there\nwill be no navigation bar? The idea is to run a .swf file within the\nMozilla browser. It works already but people have to still type in the\nlocally stored URL of the website at this point. I would like to give them\nthe regular look and feel of Icons within the sugar interface.\nThanks mucho!\nJan\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
