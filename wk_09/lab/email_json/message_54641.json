So how can I manipulate the legend, ie. Move\nit, shrink it, do anything with it. I have searched the help archives\nand found nothing, and I have looked up the legend section in ?barchart\nbut that has not helped or I am doing something wrong.  Any help is\ngreatly appreciated.\nJacquie\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
