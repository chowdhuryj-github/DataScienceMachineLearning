My major misunderstanding was in the\nfact that $1, $2, etc. can exist outside the RegEx.  I previously\nthought they had to be confined to the expression itself.  Through\nsome experimenting I find they no longer exist once the block defined\nby the 'while' statement is complete.  I presume they'll get redefined\nwith another RegEx, but I've yet to experiment on that.\n\nThanks again.\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
