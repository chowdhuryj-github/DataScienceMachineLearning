And then you have to examine\nthat item's license to determine what conditions can apply to\nthe modified version.\n\nThe MIT license permits me to apply any terms of my choosing\nto a modified version of MIT licensed code. I can be more restrictive\nthan the original with my modified version.\n\nThe GPL only permits me to apply the GPL's own terms when I\ndistribute my modified version, but imposes no restrictions when\nI do not distribute it.\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
