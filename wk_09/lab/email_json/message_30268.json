Not everyone\nwants to use a gui interface.  There are still functions under the gui\nthat are not accessible.  As for the argument that Speakup is not\npopular, you have only to look at the number of Speakup users on this\nlist.  As for the maintenance issue, speakup is no more difficult to\nmaintain than any other of the hundreds of modules that habitually are \nincluded.  The thing that makes building your own kernel more difficult\nis Ubuntu's insistence on using an initrd for a standard system.  All\nthe extra hardware discovery stuff isn't necessary once a system is\ninstalled.  Besides which, without speakup, there is no way to do a\nserver install, and Speakup has never been included in a manner that\nwould allow a blind person to do an install from a server cd.  Mot to\nmention the times when Orca or Gnome crashes in some fashion, and the\nonly way to recover things is by using Speakup from a text console.  If\nyou really have maintenence issues, talk to Kirk and find a way to\nresolve them.  I think the decission to drop Speakup from Ubuntu is\nextreemly short sighted.\n\nGene Collins\n\n>Hi,\n>\n>As part of an ongoing effort to bring our kernel tree closer with the \n>mainline kernel (ideally identical) we have opted to drop the speakup \n>patch from our tree.\n>\n>We have found it fairly difficult to maintain and it has not seen the \n>kind of usage that the graphical systems (Orca, etc) have.\n>\n>It seems that many speakup users traditionally prefer to compile their \n>own kernel, which will of course still be an option, and as Ubuntu \n>approaches a fairly standard kernel this should be fairly easy.\n>\n>This does by no means mean that we are reducing our focus on \n>accessibility.
