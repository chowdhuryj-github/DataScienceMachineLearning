And, to \n      celebrate,\u00a0\"Spider-Man\" star Kirsten Dunst had a super-heroic chat with Hannah. Miss Dunst was \n      charming and personable and \n      talked\u00a0to Hannah about her \n      role as Peter Parker's \n      girlfriend, Mary Jane \n      Watson.\n\u00a0\nAlso in the studio this \n      morning was People magazine's choice for the cover of its new\u00a0\"100\u00a0Most\u00a0Beautiful\u00a0People\" edition. Drew Barrymore is a great guest. She seems \n      at least as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. We talked \n      about her new film, \"Lucky You,\" \n      starring Eric Bana and we also\u00a0talked about her work with the United \n      Nations where she is shooting a \n      documentary about UN food programs around the world. I first \n      interviewed Drew when she \n      was\u00a0seven years old when she was the kid sister in Steven \n      Spielberg's\u00a0\"E.T.\" That was 25 years ago. She's literally \n      grown up in front of us and I have to agree with People, she really is a \n      beautiful person. \n\u00a0\nWe had the always \n      brilliant Marcus Samuelsson cook up some \n      great spring dishes with us on\u00a0the plaza and we capped\u00a0the morning off with spectacular music of \n      Il Divo. Those guys know how to sing.\n\u00a0\nWhat a show!\u00a0We'll have more for you tomorrow \n      as\u00a0\"Spider-Man\" himself, Tobey Maguire, visits the studio. We'll also\u00a0meet the \n      latest\u00a0\"Survivor\" castoff \n      and go behind-the-scenes of \"CSI\" with actor George \n      Eads.\u00a0And Dave Price will give us a preview of the world\u2019s biggest ship -- he\u2019ll \n      be broadcasting from the deck of\u00a0Royal Caribbean's brand new \n      \u201cLiberty of the \n      Seas.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTake \n      care,\n\u00a0\n      \nHarry SmithEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
