How about a dummy\n\"perlcritic-timestamp\" file that gets touched as the last step of\nConfigure.pl (and not walloped by \"make realclean\"), so that there is a\nsingle place to reset?  Or maybe it should be touched only if it doesn't\nalready exist, and we can delete it when the load creeps up?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob Rogers\n\t\t\t\t\t   http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/\n\n[Resent, since it's been more than 30H since the first post.]\n\n"}
