I am sure If we modify that regexp a little\nbit, then we can just use it on the record like this :\n\n$_ = $record;\n@fields = /regexp/g;\n\nI tried a lot of different ways but just could not get the right\nregexp :-(. \n\n-- \nCheers,\nLaxminarayan G Kamath A\ne-mail: laxminarayan@deeproot.co.in\nWork URL: http://deeproot.in\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
