But we need the\noption to be more specific if necessary, eg. with \"halfNormal=x1,\nhazardRate=x2\". Just like 'rbind', in fact.\n\nThanks,  Mike\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Getting-names-of-objects-passed-with-%22...%22-tf3850318.html#a10910245\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
