I have some problems for writing the patches\nbecause more than one bug report matches the same source file, and i have to\nwait everytime for commits before doing anything more. I understand that this\nis my problem and I should be pacient, but on pdb there are a lot of broken\nthings that are difficult to split into multiple patches.\n\nMy third patch fixes the problem of the 'help' command when calling it with arguments\nand implements the 'breaks' command to list all defined breakpoints, it also makes some\nlittle code cleanup.\n\nMy question is. How can I translate a opcode_t into a file:line message?\n\nThanks! \n\n  --pancake\n\n"}
