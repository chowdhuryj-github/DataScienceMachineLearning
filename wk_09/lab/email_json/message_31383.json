From the wiki: \"The\nIndieHIG project is an initiative created out of the necessity to\ndocument the new look and feel aspects of the Mac OS X experience,\noutside of the supervision of Apple itself. The project is not intended\nto replace, but rather to supplement the somewhat dated Apple Human\nInterface Guidelines (HIG). There are many instances of Apple using new\nand experimental interface styles, spurring developers to emulate these\nstyles in their own applications. Unfortunately, because Apple provides\nneither guidelines nor code for developers to work with, the\nimplementation of these interface styles and features by third parties\ncan be lopsided and directionless. The IndieHIG intends to change this by\nproviding a comprehensive set of guidelines governing the use and\nappearance of new, undocumented interface elements so that their\nimplementation by third party developers adheres to the unwritten\nstandards that Apple has set.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/16/0043245\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://indiehig.com/wiki/Main_Page\n    1. http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10-4.ars/18\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Threat To Free, Legal Guitar Tablature Online                      |\n|   from the you-would-prefer-piracy? dept.                          |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday May 15, @22:31 (Music)              |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/15/2149224          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nAn anonymous reader writes \"Recently Hal Leonard Corporation, the world's\nlargest songbook publisher, sent an email to the music publishing and\ncopyright community urging them not to license guitar tablature for free,\nadvertising-supported use online.
