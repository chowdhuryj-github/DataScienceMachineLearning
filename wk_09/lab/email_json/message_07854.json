However, if you read the \nhelp page you would see that the 'scaling' component of the result comes \nclose.\n\nThere are lots of definitional questions about what is meant by\n'the individual lin. discrim. functions': lda() is support software for a \nbook, and that explains its definitions.\n\n> understand that predict( ) or predict.lda( ) are the preferable\n> ways to obtain a classification prediction for new observations.\n\nOr even the linear discriminants applied to new or old observations.\n\n> I still want to \"see\" the individual lin. discrim. functions and\n> work with them myself.
