By moving-window I mean that kind of analysis\ncommon in GIS, where each pixel (matrix element) of the resulting map\nis a function of it neighbors, and the neighborhood is a square\nmatrix.\nI was hoping there was some function in R that could do that, where I\ncould define the size of the neighborhood, and then apply some\nfunction to the values, some function I don't have in GIS packages\n(like circular statistics).\n\nthanks all.\n\nCarlos\n\n\n-- \n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n              Carlos Henrique Grohmann - Guano\n  Visiting Researcher at Kingston University London - UK\n  Geologist M.Sc  - Doctorate Student at IGc-USP - Brazil\nLinux User #89721  - carlos dot grohmann at gmail dot com\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n_________________\n\"Good morning, doctors.
