There are three and\noperators in Perl: bitwise (&), high precedence logical (&&), and low\nprecedence logical (and).  In general the low precedence version works\nfine for your needs (although you will see a lot of people coming from\nC, C++, Java, etc. using && and a lot of parenthesis).  If a\nconditional statement is not returning the expect result, you may want\nto check the precedence of the operators you are using and add\nparenthesis as needed.  There is a handy chart at\nhttp://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html (or from the command line: perldoc\nperlop).\n\nsnip\n> Problem with learning something from the beginning is I don't even\n> know what that's called so searching the net is rather hard:)\nsnip\n\nWhy search the internet?  Go to http://perldoc.perl.org/.
