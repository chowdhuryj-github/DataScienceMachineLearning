It's the attribute reading key--speakup+keypad period.\n    What I'm wondering about is how, exactly, Speakup gets information on the colors of the console, or of certain text therein?\n    This is an issue which seems on the whole to be fairly complicated under a Windows system: I've yet to really find a screen reader which will duplicate it.  I'm wondering, then, how Speakup does it?\nThanks much for indulging me,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
