Enjoy jumping out of planes or  going bungee jumping in your spare time?\nWell then, my daring friends, this will be a week for you!  I\u2019m expecting this week to be the most volatile week we have seen year to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nADX: The Weakest Link\nUnlike a lot of indicators, the Average Directional Index  (ADX) doesn\u2019t tell you whether a trend is bullish or bearish. Instead, it measures  the trend\u2019s strength on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is strongest and 0 is  weakest. The method for calculating it is complicated to explain, so just  remember that readings below 20 are considered weak and readings above 40 are  considered strong.\nOn June 15, the ADX for the QQQQ hit 13.81, and Trending123's alarm bells started going off\u2014after all, that\u2019s well below the \u201cweak\u201d threshold  of 20. But get a load of this: the NASDAQ composite just hit 10.82 in the ADX.  That\u2019s not just weak, that\u2019s in critical condition.\nSo if you thought the gains in the NASDAQ since March have  been strong\u2014you\u2019re right. But if you thought the trend has been strong\u2014well, when the string of gains snaps,  boy, are you in for a surprise. With the ADX as low as it is, anyone trying to go  long now is reaching for the weakest link.

Contemplate the magnitude of the word I just used: decade!\nThough the cheerleaders out there may be spinning a  different tale, managing not to speak of the day in quite so fantastic a  fashion, I\u2019m here to deliver the truth. And not the truth as I see it but the  truth as it really is. For, as I\u2019ve said many times before, we simply can\u2019t mold  this market into what we want it to look like. It is how it is!\nGo Away in May \u2013 It Really Works!\nThere\u2019s an old bit of Wall Street that goes \u201cSell in May and  go away\u201d referring to the fact that the stock market\u2019s weakest season runs from  May 1st through October 31st.\u00a0 Many financial advisers will try to steer you away from  going away in May, telling you that it\u2019s not a phrase to trade by. Well, they  just want to make sure you stay with them. \nWhat better way to keep you on-board then to \u201cguarantee\u201d you  more money, in the way of new buys? Well, there is no real guarantee and what  might seem like a bucket of bargains could very well lead you to  Loserville\u2014where the gains are marginal but the losses are great. And who wants  those odds?!\nI certainly would never bog you down with absolutes when it  comes to investing your hard-earned money. You\u2019re gonna win some with me (click here to learn about some of Trending123\u2019s past gains)  and you\u2019re gonna lose some. \nBut I\u2019ll be darned if I\u2019m going to keep you in this market  when I can see with my own two eyes that it\u2019s crumbling! To me, that\u2019s just  insane.\nI got everyone out at the end of April because the charts  told me everything I needed to know. And ever since then, the charts have  continued to paint the same disturbing picture. \n\nExample:  the Utility index. For this month alone, the utility index is down 7% -- it\u2019s  now at lows not seen since March of this year! When did it top? Back in May.\n\nYou might not think that the Utility index is a major  player. But I assure you, those with deep pockets, invest their money in  diversified portfolios \u2013 portfolios that don\u2019t just include the RIMMs and the  Apples and the Googles. You can bet that serious investors are playing across  all sectors and that the utility index is front and center on their scorecards. \nLet me tell you something else you may not have known: this  index is one of, if not, THE most interest-rate sensitive sectors. Why? Because  they have the most debt on their balance sheets. And when we are in an environment  that has increasing interest rates, it costs them more to have a balance sheet  that is saddled down with debt \u2013 it eats away at their earnings and in turn,  their dividends. It creates a nasty snowball effect. So rising rates are not  considered bullish among these types of interest-rate sensitive groups.\nThe utility index, the S&P 500 and the DOW all have one  thing in common \u2013 they all topped in May. \nThe only (safe) way to play the market right now is through  inverse funds. We have a couple we are playing at Trending123 right now \u2013 click here to find out what they are.\nIf you are ready to see the complete picture \u2013 the one that  the cheerleaders of this market aren\u2019t allowing you to see \u2013 then I highly  encourage you to check out what I have been telling my Trending123 subscribers. My job and my joy  are the same: I want to help as many people as will listen to invest  wisely\u2026meaning that I want you to secure as many profits as possible while  deterring the losers that will get you nowhere but in the red.\nPlease join me today\u2014this special  offer takes $50 off the usual price\u2014to discover what Trending123 can do for you.\nSincerely,\n \n  John Lansing\nTrending123\nP.S.
