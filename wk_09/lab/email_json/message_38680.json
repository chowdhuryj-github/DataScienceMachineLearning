At work, I have a proxy, and at home, I do not.  I have, for work, a User environment variable \"http_proxy\" which I set in the OS (Windows XP Pro).  When I am at work, and I try to retrieve data from the web with 'read.csv', things work just fine.  I assume it knows how to use the proxy.\n> >\n> > The trouble is when I am at home and have no proxy, R still tries to use my work proxy.
