But I want to move little bit further. I want to show some basic features interactively. I want to move my mouse pointer through the X axis. In graphics window I want to show that, for a particular position of pointer in X-axis, there will be a vertical straightline from that position, which will cull the curve at a point, and from this point another horizontal straight line will be there, which will cut to Y-axis at a particular point. And upon moving my pointer along X-axis, that mapping-point in Y-axis will also move along y-axis accordingly. I also want to mark the position of X-axis point and Y-axis point interactively. \n \nI know there is a package \"TeachingDemos\" for creating this type of interactive picture. But I really dont know how to apply this in my problem.\n \nCan anyone give me any suggestion? Your help will be highly appreciated.\n \nThanks and regards,\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Gabor Grothendieck \nTo: Ron Michael \nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSent: Wednesday, April 18, 2007 10:08:32 PM\nSubject: Re: [R] Problem with ?curve\n\n\nYour chipply function is not vectorized.
