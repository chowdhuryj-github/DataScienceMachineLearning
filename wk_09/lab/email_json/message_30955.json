Guess I shouldn't do that.\n\nWhat is the correct way to reset a laptop to an \"out of box\" state ?\nDeleting all files and directories except nm, logs, and session.info ?\n\nThanks,\nwad\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
