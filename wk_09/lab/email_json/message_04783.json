Fifteen years later, I still thank God every day that I said \n      \"yes.\"\n\u00a0\nSo I \n      was tickled to hear the story of how our \"Wedding in a Week\" couple, Lisa Mayo & Stephen Wilfong, got engaged. \n      He literally wrote a fairy tale for her as his proposal \u2014 and with a \n      surprise ending! \n\u00a0\nThe big surprise is \n      that all next week, we'll be helping them get ready for their wedding, \n      with the \"Rolls Royce of party\nplanners,\" as Julie called him, Colin Cowie. Colin will guide the \n      couple, all week long, as they select their attire, flowers, cake \u2026 even \n      jewelry. And on Friday, we'll pull it all together with a big, beautiful \n      ceremony, live on our show plaza and at the Hudson Hotel here in \n      New York \n      City. I'll be there, \n      teary, no doubt, and I hope you'll join us, \n      too.\n\u00a0\nTake \n      care,\n\nTracy \n      SmithEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTo \nunsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \nEmail Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, NY, \n10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc.
