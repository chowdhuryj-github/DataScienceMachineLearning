Progress rocks!!!  I got speech-dispatcher running if I \ninvoke it from the command line with sudo speech-dispatcher.  My log \nis being sent to stdout, but I'm sure the next time I run it, it'll \nbe logged to a file.  I'm assuming it's just because I haven't had \nspeechd.log.  Now for the million dollar question.  What is the \neasiest way to get speech-dispatcher to start as a service when I \nboot.  Can you give me an example of proper rc.d syntax to do \nthis?  Do I then have to run some kind of update?  Thanks again, in \nadvance for the help.\n\n\nGuy\n\n\nAt 04:37 AM 6/3/2007, you wrote:\n>Hi,\n>I work with Ubuntu 7.04, the latest Orca and SD as speech system, \n>and I never had to create /var/run/speech-dispatcher directory manually.\n>I remember however, that Krishnakant reports the same problem as he \n>tried to set up SD for Orca.\n>So I think that this issue should be investigated further.\n>Hermann\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
