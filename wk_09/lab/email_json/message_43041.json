Would it be too \nlabor-intensive to have a broadcast-only mailing list for the \nnotifications, instead of a single maintainer's email address?  In at \nleast AbiWord, there may be multiple people capable of resolving an \nissue, and so a mailing list would permit those interested to sign up to \nbe notified on a granular basis.\n\nRyan\n\n-- \nRyan Pavlik\nAbiWord Win32 Platform Maintainer, Art Lead: www.abisource.com\nAbiWord Community Outreach Project: www.cleardefinition.com/oss/abi/blog/\n\n\"Optimism is the father that leads to achievement.\"\n -- Helen Keller\n\n\"The folder structure in a modern Linux distribution such as Ubuntu\nwas largely inspired by the original UNIX foundations that were\ncreated by men with large beards and sensible jumpers.\"\n -- Jono Bacon, The Ubuntu Guide\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
