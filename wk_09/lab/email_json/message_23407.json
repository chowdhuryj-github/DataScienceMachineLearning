I have never met you, but  my heart has longed  for you as soon as I have seen you. I want to take care of you with all my heart. If want to find your companion, look at me here http://thanxtolove.com/waiting\nMy inner voice says to me that you are  the companion that I have wanted for so long.  You are the man with whom I want to share life's adventures.\n\nHave a nice day\nIrisha G\n\n\n"}
