The help.search produces no results and there is also nothing\ninto the archive, well one post asking what is part correlation. Just\nquickly from Field [Discovering statistics using spss]:\n\n\"When we do a partial correlation between two variables, we control\nfor the effect of a third variable. Specifically, the effect that the\nthird variable has on BOTH variables in the correlation is controlled.\nIn a semi-partial correlation we control for the effect that the third\nvariable has on only one of the variables in the correlation.\"\n\nApologies if it is a trivial question.
