With current R version 2.5.0 the step() function was changed\nso that the heading of trace=TRUE output for each model is printed using\ncommand message():\n\n        if (trace) \n            message(\"\\nStep:  AIC=\", format(round(bAIC, 2)), \n                \"\\n\", cut.string(deparse(as.vector(formula(fit)))), \n                \"\\n\")\n\nAnd the actual models concerned with true blue print():\n\n            if (trace) \n                print(aod[o, ])\n\nThe problem here is that these parts go to different places: message()\nprints on the terminal where you run Sweave (or to stderr()), and\nprint() prints to the result file (like it should do). Therefore the\nresult file is without the step header, and looks bad.\n\nI believe there must be a way of getting all output to the result file,\nbut I haven't yet found that way. Can anybody here show me the light.\n\nI had a similar problem when sink()ing the output to a file, but there I\ncould find a solution (clumsy, but a solution: you need to double your\nsink()s). \n\nAn optimal solution would be to change the function back to the old\nbehaviour where all trace output is printed without message(). I bet\nthat won't happen, though.\n\nCheers, Jari Oksanen\n-- \nJari Oksanen \n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
