But it doesn't have to.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That's why I feel I must tell you this amazing story about miracles.\nHow Lourdes' history can happily change your future\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, you may well have already heard about Lourdes, a town in France, and of the events in the mid-19th century that have transformed it into one of the most important places of emotional, spiritual, and physical healing in the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1858, a French peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous, while going about her simple life, received the blessing of a vision of the Virgin Mary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, where young Bernadette saw the beautiful woman in the grotto, her unbelieving neighbors could only see barren rock, the innocent child was able to see by the light of love and faith what was hidden in the darkness of others' minds. \u00a0 What followed were an astonishing series of miracles, when the Holy Virgin could be seen as well as the miraculous creation of a limitless spring of water from an arid rock.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Bernadette\u2019s worth was not valued. All around her were skeptics and non-believers. She was mocked and diminished and did not receive the seriousness she knew she deserved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now tell me, Memo, is this a feeling that sounds sadly familiar?\nJuly 16th was a miraculous and powerful date then and can be one for you NOW\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The date of July 16th was the eighteenth and last appearance of the Holy Virgin to Bernadette. This day, although her way to the grotto was blocked by a barrier, the call of the Virgin could not be denied.  Bernadette arrived at the grotto by way of the stream called Gave, her destination when she saw the first apparition.\nBernadette at last got what she needed and so can you!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was only after this date that Bernadette was finally empowered, respected and trusted. It was on this date that she received the validation of those around her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when the Virgin Mary spoke to Bernadette, all doubts about her visions were then laid to rest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This new belief in herself went on to change her life and also to change the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After this miracle, even more people flocked to the quiet town of Lourdes to witness and experience for themselves the prophesies, countless healing miracles, and life-altering transformations of this special place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For over 150 years, the name of the small town of Lourdes and its spring have been synonymous with miraculous healings.\nNow the world-renowned healing spirit of Lourdes can come to you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, I can actually tell you how to bring the spirit of the Lourdes miracles right into your home and into your life and the lives of your loved ones, to help bring about astonishing changes, sensational opportunities and unforeseen joy!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now you can make this pilgrimage without leaving home.
