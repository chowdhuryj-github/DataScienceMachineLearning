You could also look at non-metric multidimensional\nscaling. There seems to be 2 \"schools\" of ordination. The Europeans like\neigenanalysis methods (PCA, correspondence analysis, multiple\ncorrespondence analysis, coinertia analysis etc.). The Americans seem to\nprefer MDS.\n\nCheers,\n\nSimon.\n\n This is On Tue, 2007-06-12 at 20:17 -0700, Spencer Graves wrote:\n> The problem with applying prcomp to binary data is that it's not \n> clear what problem you are solving. \n> \n>       The standard principal components and factor analysis models \n> assume that the observations are linear combinations of unobserved \n> \"common\" factors (shared variability), normally distributed, plus normal \n> noise, independent between observations and variables.
