I would like to\nread those data; however, only the data in rows 1, 3, 5, 7, ... are\nimportant; the other lines (2,4,6,8,....) contain no useful information for\nme.\nSo far I used awk/gawk to do it:\ngawk '{if ((FNR % 2) != 0) {print $0}}' infile.txt > outfile.txt\n\nWhat is the recommended way to accomplish this in R?\nSimply reading the whole file, and deleting all the even-numbered lines is\nnot straightforward since these lines have different length (whereas lines\n1,3,5,7,... have the same length).\n\nI 'RSiteSearched' for \"read every second line from a file\" but this search\ndid not yield the desired result.\nAlso trying out the arguments nrows and skip from read.table()  did not\nhelp.\n\nMaybe someone knows an easy way to do it from within R? -- of course not\nusing system(\"gawk ....\") :-)\nIf not, it does not matter too much since I get the job done easily with\nawk.\n\nThanks,\nRoland\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
