The work around that has been described several times does solve the problem.\n\n> \n> An alternative in Hmisc that Frank Harrell pointed out\n> is to do a SAS export file and a special version of\n> the format file.\n> \n> It is described in the Hmisc reference manual See\n> sasxport.get .

But if you have access to SAS and have SAS datasets that you want to use in R, I would rather import them directly than to go to the extra step of creating a sas xport file and then importing that.  \n\nDan\n\nDaniel Nordlund\nBothell, WA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
