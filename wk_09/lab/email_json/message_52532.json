Cygwin is more \nfull functioned than MinGW but more complex and has a few quirks that \nI really do not like, for example it's installation process is bizarre and \nannoying, the way it maps windows directories to unix naming is weird,\nthe options for file types can be confusing, and I found that sometimes \nits impossible to remove all of cygwin. It creates some files that just \ncannot be deleted, I hate software that does that. On the other hand \nit's an impressive environment, you can almost have it look exactly \nlike a linux machine.I have used Cygwin and MinGW and I have to \nsay that MinGW was simple in the way I like it. I do not like complex \ndevelopment environments. I don't want to spend a week just to \nfigure out how to do hello world. MinGW is faster to get actually \nprogramming with, and although limited in comparison, was just \nright for my needs. It has the win32 API:\n\nhttp://www.mingw.org/docs.shtml#win32api\n\nI did some win32 with this and I loved it because it's GNU and very \nstraightforward. The Win32 API however is extremely complex and \nvery annoying. Surprised?  Your battle will be more one of \nunderstanding the win32 API that one of tools. It can take quite a \nwhile to do the simplest of things with win32. I would recommend \nlooking for some small tutorials, that's what I did and found a few \nthat got me started. Find a getting started tutorial for MinGW and \nlook for really simple win32 examples. I didn't do any win32 serial \ncode but you can most likely find some examples on the net. \nI don't know anything about SAPI.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
