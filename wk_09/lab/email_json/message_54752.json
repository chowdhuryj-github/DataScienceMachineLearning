Something like this:\n\nmatplot(t(matrix(runif(40), ncol=2)), type=\"b\", col=\"black\", lty=1,\nxaxt=\"n\", pch=16)\n\nmtext(side=1, at=c(1,2), c(\"Pre\",\"Post\"))\n\n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n-- \nChuck Cleland, Ph.D.\nNDRI, Inc.\n71 West 23rd Street, 8th floor\nNew York, NY 10010\ntel: (212) 845-4495 (Tu, Th)\ntel: (732) 512-0171 (M, W, F)\nfax: (917) 438-0894\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
