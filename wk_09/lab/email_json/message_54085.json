No 300 million dollar unveiling event for this\nkernel, I'm afraid, but you're still supposed to think of this as the\n\"happening of the century\" (at least until the next kernel comes along).\nOh, and this is another kernel in that great and venerable \"BugFree(tm)\"\nseries of kernels. So be not afraid of bugs, but go out in the streets\nand deliver this message of joy to the masses.\n\t-- Linus Torvalds, on releasing 1.3.27\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
