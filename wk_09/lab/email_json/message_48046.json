There is a driver for HTML sweaving in the\nR2HTML package and the odfWeave package allows you to sweave with open\noffice docs (which can be converted to/from MS word).  I personally like\nusing LaTeX and the original sweave, but I work with people who want\neverything in MS word or similar, so for them I will create a template\nfile in open office, odfWeave that, convert to MS word and send that to\nthem.\n\nI think the offset is more that S-PLUS 8 is supposed to implement many\nof the things that R does now (I don't know which, I'm waiting for my\ncopy of 8), so soon it may be possible to sweave in both.\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
