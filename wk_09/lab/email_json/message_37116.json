There are many good c thread tutorials\non google.\n\nc threads make it much easier to share data and subroutines between\nthreads.\n\nThe best thing to do, is work out little example code snippets, and try\nto make the threads communicate. While doing that you will run into all\nthe little details which you need to know.\n\nGood luck,\nzentara\n\n\n\n-- \nI'm not really a human, but I play one on earth.\nhttp://zentara.net/japh.html\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
