[0]These networks are increasingly\nbeing used to trick PCs into attacking other machines, experts say. In\nfact, some reports indicate that peer-to-peer may actually exceed web\ntraffic. Computer scientists have previously shown how P2P networks can\nbe subverted so that several connected PCs gang up to attack a single\nmachine, flooding it with enough traffic to make it crash. This can work\neven if the target is not part of the P2P network itself. Now, security\nexperts are warning that P2P networks are increasingly being used to do\njust this. \"Until January of this year we had never seen a peer-to-peer\nnetwork subverted and used for an attack,\" says Darren Rennick of\ninternet security company Prolexic in an [1]advisory released recently.\n\"We now see them constantly being subverted.\"\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/31/003207\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.newscientisttech.com/article.ns?id=dn11949&feedId=online-news_rss20\n    1. http://www.prolexic.com/news/20070514-alert.php\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| First Nations Want Cellphone Revenue                               |\n|   from the the-great-spirit-wants-his-cut dept.                    |\n|   posted by samzenpus on Wednesday May 30, @22:12 (Communications) |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/30/235203               |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nPeacenik45 writes \"The CBC is reporting that First Nations in Manitoba\nwant [0]compensation for every cell phone signal that passes through\ntheir land because it violates their airspace.
