Any ideas?\n\nAre you sure that's the problem?  You have two closing parens after that\nfile is listed; I think that succeeded, and the error happened afterwards.\n\nI'd be suspicious of the Sweave \\usepackage line.  Perhaps MiKTeX now\nrequires backslashes instead of forward slashes, or maybe the quotes are \ncausing problems.   (Your \\usepackage line worked fine here, but I'm \nusing MikTeX 2.4.  MikTeX has a habit of making incompatible changes.)\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
