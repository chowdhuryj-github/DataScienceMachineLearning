Many found themselves trapped behind chained and padlocked doors. SWAT team members with helmets, flak jackets and assault rifles swarmed over the campus. A student used his cell-phone camera to record the sound of bullets echoing through a stone building.\n\nTrey Perkins, who was sitting in a German class in Norris Hall, told The Washington Post that the gunman barged into the room at about 9:50 a.m. and opened fire for about a minute and a half, squeezing off about 30 shots. \n\nThe gunman first shot the professor in the head and then fired on the students, Perkins said. The gunman was about 19 years old and had a \"very serious but very calm look on his face,\" he said. \n\n\"Everyone hit the floor at that moment,\" said Perkins, 20, of Yorktown, Va., a sophomore studying mechanical engineering. \"And the shots seemed like it lasted forever.\" \n\nErin Sheehan, who was also in the German class, told the student newspaper, the Collegiate Times, that she was one of only four of about two dozen people in the class to walk out of the room. The rest were dead or wounded, she said. \n\nShe said the gunman \"was just a normal-looking kid, Asian, but he had on a Boy Scout-type outfit. He wore a tan button-up vest, and this black vest, maybe it was for ammo or something.\" \n\n--!>Visit here to get enrolled for your Health Care degree!      \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
