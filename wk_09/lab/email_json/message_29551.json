US \nlaw protects compilations of facts only to the extent that the selection \nof the facts is creative expression (and does not protect the facts \nthemselves).  Many other jurisdictions (eg European Union) also offer \nprotection based on the effort need to compile the facts regardless of any \ncreativity.  A 1997 US Supreme Court decision (in a case about telephone \ndirectories) ruled that the 'sweat of the brow' rationale for copyright \nwas inconsistent with the intellectual property clause of the US \nConstitution.  So, in the US, it depends on the data and their source.\n\nPublishers that I have talked to tend to claim that data are definitely \ncopyrightable, but since they tend to own the copyrights one might do well \nto recall the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies.\n\n \t-thomas\n\nThomas Lumley\t\t\tAssoc.
