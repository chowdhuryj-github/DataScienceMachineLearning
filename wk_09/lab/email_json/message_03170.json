Or just wait longer.\n\nDan\n\n> Dan\n> \n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> Sugar mailing list\n> Sugar@laptop.org\n> http://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
