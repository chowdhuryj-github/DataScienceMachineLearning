Yes you need a shape file with that information.\n\n2. One place to look is:\nhttp://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html There are shapefiles\n(the .shp ones) for counties and zip codes (as well as many other\nthings).  These work pretty directly with the tools in the maptools and\nsp packages.\n\n3. Read the .shp file in using maptools, the .dbf information is\nautomatically read in as well (with whatever details come with the\nshapefile), then look at the structure of what you read in, you will see\nthe data frame and you should be able to just add your data into that\ndata frame, or use it seperately.\n\n4. plot.Map has an option auxvar, though it is now prefered to use the\nplot methods for the more specific objects (SpatialLinesDataFrame object\nfrom the readLinesShape function).  I would expect that they would have\nan auxvar or similar argument also.  Or you can decide what color you\nwant to use, plot the overall map, then add each county/zipcode\nindividually using the specified color.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
