Coli.\nThis data will be used in bioinformatics research to generate a\nMarkov\nMatrix.\n\n\nHowever, I am just beginning PERL and ran into a slight problem.\n\n\nBasically, I need the frequencies of the 4 bases, Adenosine (A),\nThymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). I made a PERL script to\ntally up the total counts of the bases. In my case, there are 6254\nAdenosine,  4957 Thymine, 4245 Cytosine, and 3534 Guanine.\n\n\nIn order to find the frequencies, all I would do is divide each base\ncount by the total.\n\n\nHowever, here is my problem. Instead of doing it globally. I need to\nbe able to specify an arbitrary start and stop position to start\ntallying the occurences of the bases and also to find the frequencies\nof the bases in that particularly defined area.\n\n\nHerein lies my problem. I have not a clue how to go about doing this\ntask. I've been looking online for a solution but haven't really\nfound\none. If anyone can suggest an idea or function(s) I could use to go\nabout doing this task. I would be much obliged. Thanks!\n\n\n~Michael\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
