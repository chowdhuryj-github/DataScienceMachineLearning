When I try to use data.frame(\"filename.txt\") it tells me object not found, which makes it difficult to use attach() or with().  How do I get R to recognize my data?  \n\nThanks,\nSusie\nPhD Student UCI\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLuggage? GPS?
