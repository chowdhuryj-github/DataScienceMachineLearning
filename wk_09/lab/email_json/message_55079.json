Before, \nI'd like to merge a couple of other things I have partially (but not\nentirely) finished:\n\n * 4.0-codepage: Move codepage data inside library (may need some discussion)\n * 4.0-dso: More shared library improvements, allowing Samba 4 to work\n   with a system-provided ldb.\n * 4.0-elimref: Removes pointer_type_top(unique) where it is still\n   remaining\n * 4.0-namedpipe: Adds a separate named pipe API for Samba 4\n * 4.0-nestedpidl: pidl support for nested structs/unions\n * 4.0-portstring: Converts all port ints to service names\n * 4.0-regwrite, of course\n * 4.0-python: Embeds python, rewrite of provisioning in Python\n * 4.0-reduceparam: Remove some unused parameters\n * 4.0-socket-refactor: Simplifies the socket code a bit, initial \n       work on support for netbios named pipes as part of the socket\n\t   subsystem\n * 4.0-spoolss: Spoolss tests\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n\n-- \nJelmer Vernooij  - http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/\n\n"}
