As confirmed by Ingy++, The current version of YAML::Syck\non CPAN is having problem with single-quotes in its emitter:\n\nhttp://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2007-04-17,Tue&sel=65#l108\n\nI've noticed that this issue didn't affect Larry's recent smokes.\nMaybe he was using an older YAML::Syck? or he simply didn't install\nYAML::Syck at all?\n\nCheers, agentz\n\nP.S. Moritz has confirmed on #perl6 that his smoke works again. Yay!\n\n"}
