Mostly, stuff costs what it costs. But there is a \nthread going on on the jaws list right now about Freedom Scientific becoming \narrogant because jaws is \"institutionalized\".  Once you've purchased jaws, \nit is very difficult to move to a competitor because it requires another \nhuge outlay of cash and time.\n\nFor years, I have been wanting to switch to Window-Eyes when I'm working \nwith Windows. But I haven't even asked the University to buy Window-eyes \nbecause I know it would be opening a can of worms. The University bought \nJaws originally on my recommendation. But now it's on the lab machines and I \ncan't ask them to switch to something else. Also, I would have to learn how \nto use Window-eyes and at least for a while, I'd be less productive. I'd \nhave to provide justification for that as well.\n\nMy current plan is to switch to either orca or VoiceOver as soon as either \none of those tools is ready for prime time. I'll either buy a Mac for home \nor  set up a PC with orca at home and learn the new screen reader that way.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
