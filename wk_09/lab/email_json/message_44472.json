I think\nnot.\n\nRegarding the return flight, the lawyer is criticized for not staying in\nRome after CDC officials informed him he had a drug-resistant form of\ntuberculosis and should not fly on commercial airlines.  If you couldn't\nafford to charter a private plane, and you still weren't coughing, would\nyou sit happily in Rome while diplomats dithered, and risk being stuck\nthere, perhaps to die, or would you do as Mr. Speaker did and privately\nmake your way back to your home country?  I know I'd try to get home,\nthinking those officials were over-reacting, while trying to cover their\nown derrieres.\n\nAnd I think that's still what's going on today.\n\nNow, I've had no experience with the Centers for Disease Control . . . at\nleast I don't think I have.  Approximately 30 years ago, I too tested\npositive for tuberculosis.  I suspect I picked it up in Louisiana. \nFollowing detection, which came via a routine chest X-ray, I went through\na regime of simple treatments that may well have been paid for by the CDC.\n They lasted perhaps a year and I've been in fine health since.\n\nSo, I visited the web site of the Centers for Disease Control, where I\nfound this subhead: \"Your Online Source for Credible Health Information\"\n\nI was hoping for something a little more proactive, like, \"Making the\nWorld Safer for All of Us\" or \"Keeping Americans Healthy for over 60\nYears.\"  But no, all I get is an online source which, in addition to\nup-to-date information on Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR\nTB), includes \"Tips on Health and Safety for Gardeners,\"   \n\"Spotlight on Injuries from Fireworks\" and \"Older Adult Drivers: Fact\nSheet.\"\n\nIn short, while the CDC is the world's leading authority on dangerous\ncommunicable diseases (a fact that I deeply appreciate), it seems to spend\na fair amount of time (and taxpayer money) on more prosaic matters.\n\nA little digging reveals these facts.  The organization was established in\n1946, tasked with carrying on the work of a wartime malaria control\nagency.  So it was located in Atlanta, central to the malaria problem.  In\nits first year, its budget was about $1 million.\n\nToday, CDC employs some 15,000 people and has a budget of $8.2 billion.\n\nThat's a compound growth rate of  nearly 16% per year!\n\n$2.0 billion goes to vaccines for children\n$1.7 billion goes to fighting infectious diseases\n$1.6 billion goes to fighting terrorism\n$958 million goes to health promotion\n$218 million goes to health information\n$262 million goes to occupational safety and health\n\nNo doubt much of that money is well spent.  It's comforting to know that,\nthanks to CDC's work, large-scale epidemics are extremely unlikely in this\ncountry.  But there's also no doubt that some of that money is wasted. \nThat's a given when you're dealing with a large government agency.\n\nInterestingly, President Bush tried to cut the organization's budget by 2%\nin 2007 from $8.4 billion to $8.2 billion.   (In Washington, that's known\nas slashing).  Slated for elimination (among others) from the Health\nPromotion Department were programs addressing Epilepsy, Lupus, Alzheimer's\nDisease and Chronic Kidney Disease.  The reason: these programs had not\ndemonstrated health impact and were not focused on primary prevention.\n\nBut the budget ended up at $9 billion!  And the four programs mentioned\nabove remained intact.  So for 2008, Bush has proposed taking it down to\n$8.8 billion, in part by eliminating funding for Anthrax research ($13.9\nmillion) and reducing funding for state and local West Nile Virus programs\n($16.9 million).  I think we know what the chances of that are!\n\nAnd this brings me to a piece of news that received far less coverage than\nthe TB lawyer this week but in the long run may prove far more important.\n\nIn short, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave a $105 million grant to\nthe University of Washington to establish the Institute for Health Metrics\nand Evaluation in Seattle.  That follows the gift of $50 million in 2005\nto create the Health Metrics Network with the World Health Organization.\n\nThe question the Gates Foundation is trying to answer is simple.  Of all\nthe money being spent in public health programs around the globe, which\ndollars are actually making the biggest difference . . . and which are\nbeing wasted?\n\nIn business, we measure everything possible, and over time we learn to\npursue the most effective paths to our goals.\n\nBut in the world of public health, politics is often more powerful than\nreason. And one of the reasons is that there's precious little data\ndocumenting the effectiveness of these programs.\n\nSo I look forward to positive results from the Gates Foundation's efforts\nover time.  Perhaps they'll even take a look at the CDC.\n\n----- Advertisement -----\n\nTop 12 Stocks to Own Now\n\nAn independent panel of Wall Street experts just released the names and\nticker symbols of their 12 favorite stock picks for June 2007.

But I don't have any; the sector is rather calm these\ndays.  Sure, some people say Pfizer is cheap, and I can't argue with that,\nbut I can't sink my teeth into it either.\n\nSo instead I'll skip back to the theme of airlines, where I have two\nideas.\n\nThe first is a little-known company named Spirit AeroSystems (SPR).   \nIt sounds like a new-age airline, but in reality it's the world's leading\nmanufacturer of airline structural assemblies like fuselages, nacelles,\nthrust reversers, pylons, wings, etc.  And it's an American company,\nlocated in Kansas!\n\nSo where did this company come from?  It was spun out of Boeing in 2005,\nacquired by a Canadian investment firm named Onex, and it just came public\nin October 2006.  Its biggest customer is Boeing, its second largest is\nAirbus, and then there's the military, which pushes the envelope by asking\nfor structures that are radar absorbent and translucent.\n\nI like Spirit for its dominance of this market.  And I like the market\nbecause it's hot.  The greatest demand these days is coming from Asia, but\nairlines all over the world, suddenly back in the black, are feeling a lot\nfreer about spending money.  Boeing's backlog is now $262 billion, and\nevery one of those planes uses structures and parts created by Spirit.\n\nIn the first quarter, Spirit's revenues grew 42% to $954 million, while\nearnings grew 178% to $0.50 per share.  The after-tax profit margin was\n7.3%.  And the stock looks cheap on two counts.  The PSR (price/sales\nratio) is just 0.7, while the PE (price/earnings) ratio is just 24.\n\nAs for the stock's action, after coming public at 26 last October, the\nstock climbed to 34 in December, and then returned to 27 to build a double\nbottom.  That set the stage for the current advance, which saw the stock\nbreak out into new high ground in May.  That's good, but it's not much\nbetter than the broad market.  So while Spirit has been featured in the\nCabot Market Letter, it's not part of its regularly followed portfolio.\n\nInterestingly, if you look into the company's recent news, you see that\nlast week six company insiders were selling large amounts of stock!\n\n>From time to time I get inquiries from readers about insider selling, and\nhere is my stock answer.\n\n\"We like to say that there is only one reason for insider buying (a belief\nthat the stock will go up) but that there are many reasons for insider\nselling, including a need to fund options purchases, a desire for\ndiversification, or a desire to buy the wife a second home.\n\nIn short, it's not a major red flag for us.  Far more important is the\naction of the stock itself, which reflects the opinions of all investors\ninvolved - most of whom know about the insider selling.\"\n\nIn the case of Spirit, the insider selling follows the May 22 divestiture\nby Onex of half its interest in Spirit.  After the sale, Onex still owns\none-fourth of the company.  So without even digging into the particulars,\nit's obvious that the simultaneous selling by six insiders is related to\neither the recent divestiture or last year's IPO.\n\nAs I said, there are many legitimate - and untroubling - reasons for\ninsider selling.\n\nWe do like the fact that Spirit is liquid, with average daily trading\nvolume of over a million shares.  And we like the message the chart is\nsending - that it has the potential to run higher.  We just don't see\nenough sponsorship in the stock today to convince us that it's going to\nmake a big move anytime soon.  But we'll be keeping an eye on it.\n\n-----\n\nMy second idea is also in the airline industry, and I can't tell you the\nname of this company because we just added it to the Model Portfolio of\nthe Cabot Market Letter this week, and it wouldn't be fair to paying\nsubscribers to spread this news to outsiders so soon.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that this company is in the business of furnishing\nairplane interiors.  From seats to entertainment systems, coffee pots to\noxygen delivery systems, food trolleys to lighting systems, this company\ndoes it all.\n\nAnd business is booming, as the company works to outfit not just all the\nnew planes being built but also to retrofit older planes.  While the Asian\nairlines are buying lots of new planes, the American and European airlines\nare spending a lot of money on refurbishing.\n\nThe result is accelerating growth of both revenues and earnings, and the\nhighest profit margins in years.  This stock, like Spirit, trades over a\nmillion shares a day, and it's strong, hitting new highs with great\nregularity.\n\n-----\n\nEditor's note:\n\nYou can learn the name of this aircraft interior furnisher, and receive\nthis week's issue of the Cabot Market Letter, and get continuing coverage\nof the stock and all others in the Model Portfolio, by taking a no-risk\ntrial subscription today.
