The \u00a9 symbol is\nunambiguous under the law, and thus preferred.\n\n> Further, whether (C) or \u00a9, isn't it superfluous to use it after the\n> word \"copyright\" which itself means the same thing?\n\nSuperfluous, yes. It is often helpful to the reader though. I\nrecommend having the notice give the full \"Copyright \u00a9 2007 Foo Bar\"\nform, unless there are extreme issues of space.\n\n\nIANAL, TINLA.\n\n-- \n \\       \"I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in |\n  `\\           every culture, is the story of Popeye.\"  -- Jack Handey |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
