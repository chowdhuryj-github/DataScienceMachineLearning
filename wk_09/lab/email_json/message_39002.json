R is a C program and accesses the\nenvironment via the C calls getenv and (on Windows) putenv.  This is not\nWindows scripting (Grothendieck's earlier reference): the C runtime\nmaintains only one environment block.\n\nI've re-checked, and suspect the problem is in the following comment in\n?download.file\n\n      These environment variables must be set before the download code\n      is first used: they cannot be altered later by calling\n      'Sys.setenv'.\n\nIf I have http_proxy set in the environment, the proxy is not used in\nany of the following cases:\n\n- Calling R from a shortcut with http_proxy=\"\" on the target (see the\nrw-FAQ).\n\n- Calling R from a shortcut with no_proxy=\"*\" on the target.\n\n- Using Sys.unsetenv(\"http_proxy\") right at the start of the R session.\n\n- Using Sys.setenv(no_proxy=\"*\") right at the start of the R session.\n\nIf you set options(internet.info=0) you will see exactly what is tried.\n\nAnother possibility is that R is being used with --internet2, in which\ncase none of this applies, and the simple answer is not to use\n--internet2 at home.\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 29 May 2007, Gabor Grothendieck wrote:\n\n> You can have 4 different http_proxy environment variables and if you \n> set one type but try to unset a different type then that will have no \n> effect on the one you originally set.
