We'll look at some of the creative efforts the technology has been unleashing, and the increasing craze on sites such as YouTube for posting re-enactments of famous scenes from films.\n\n\nTo whet your appetite, below is a YouTube link to one man's one-man Goodfellas cyber-homage.  Here's your opportunity to get into a spot of afternoon wilfing, and we'd like to point out that the clip contains strong language from the outset.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLje9McwxvA&NR\n\nNewsnight, presented by Gavin Esler, returns from its Easter slumber tonight at 10.30pm on BBC TWO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
