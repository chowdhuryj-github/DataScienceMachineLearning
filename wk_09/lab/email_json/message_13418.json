Although drug companies complain\nthe loudest that Thailand has failed to engage in prior negotiation, in\nfact, the record shows that Thailand has engaged in many fruitless\nnegotiations with the drug industry for the past two years.\n\nLie No-2: Roger Bates, American Enterprise Institute: \"It is generally\nunderstood that compulsory licences should be confined to 'public health\ncrises, including those relating to HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and\nother epidemics,' which represent a 'national emergency or other\ncircumstances of extreme urgency'.\"\n\nTruth: This assertion is the most widely circulated and most repeated\nmisrepresentation that Big Pharma has propagated. The Doha Declaration of\n2001 is exquisitely clear that, \"each member has the right to grant\ncompulsory licences and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which\nsuch licences are granted\". Although there are special rules for\nemergencies that permit expedited procedures for granting a licence, the\nright to issue compulsory licences is not limited to public-health\nemergencies.\n\nTeera Chakajnarodom, president of Thailand's Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers' Association, takes the alleged emergency rule and raises it\none degree higher: \"The law allows such actions with pharmaceutical\nproducts only in cases of extreme national emergencies, or during wartime.\"\n\nLie No-3: Teera again: \"After the company does 10 years of research, and\nthen suddenly the Thai government would like to impose the compulsory\nlicence, taking away their property, their assets.\"\n\nTruth: Patents are not \"property\" in the traditional sense - they are\ngovernment-granted rights that are intended to balance the interests of\ninnovators and the public at large, and which are granted by governments\nwith many express and implied conditions, including the right to issue\ncompulsory licences. Governments around the world, including the US, have\nissued thousands of compulsory licences since the late nineteenth century,\nincluding on pharmaceutical products. Moreover, Thailand had its compulsory\nlicence law on the books when all three companies, Merck, Abbott, and\nSanofi-Aventis, filed their patent claims in Thailand.\n\nLie No-4: Khun Teera again: \"Everything is negotiable.\"\n\nTruth: For monopoly-based drug companies, everything isn't negotiable.\nAbbott has flatly refused for nearly six months to lower its mid-tier price\nfor Kaletra. Moreover, even when negotiating deeper discount prices, drug\ncompanies frequently extract promises that countries will refrain from\nseeking other cheaper sources of supply. In this context, drug companies\nare mainly interested in preventing generic competition.\n\nParadoxically, in pursuing the generic-freeze-out option, drug companies\nwill occasionally give concessions to bigger middle-income countries that\n\"make the market\" even though they would not do so for smaller and poorer\ncountries like Guatemala.\n\nLie No-5: Harvey Bale, director-general of the International Federation of\nPharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations: \"Compulsory licensing can be a\nroute to commercial abuse.\"\n\nTruth: Monopolies and excessive pricing are not commercial abuse, but\ncompetition and lower prices are - go figure. For the hugely rich, R&D drug\nindustry (more than 90 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market) to\ncomplain about commercial abuse by generic producers (less than 10 per cent\nof the global pharmaceutical market) is deeply ironic.\n\nA particular form of this complaint has been asserted by Pharma apologists\nRoger Bates and Ronald Cass. These two industry-sponsored pundits complain\nthat licenses might eventually be granted to Thailand's own publicly owned,\nprofit-making pharmaceutical company, the Government Pharmaceutical\nOrganisation (GPO). They assert that this will be a form of cheating\nbecause production by the GPO will create a commercial advantage to\ndomestic producers, who might thereafter become regional suppliers to other\ncountries.\n\nNothing in TRIPS prohibits granting licences to profit-making entities.\nSince Big Pharma has disinvested in developing countries' pharmaceutical\ncapacity post-TRIPS, it makes sense for countries to increase their own\ncapacity to meet domestic and regional needs for essential medicines.\n\nLie No-6: Harvey Bale: \"Compulsory licensing can ... put patients at risk.\"\nMerck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis also warn that overriding patents risks\njeopardising quality.\n\nIn terms of product quality, Bale roll outs out another old chestnut -\n\"generics are inferior\". He neglects to mention that multiple generic\nversions of efavirenz manufactured in India have already received\npre-qualification at the WHO. Although it is true that the Thai Government\nPharmaceutical Organisation has not yet received WHO-pre-qualification on\nits first-line ARVs, it is building a good manufacturing practices\nmanufacturing plant after which it will surely meet global standards.\n\nLie No-7: All of the sources from Big Pharma previously quoted have said\nthat compulsory licences will reduce incentives for innovation.\n\nTruth: All of Asia (except Japan) and all of Africa comprise only 5.1 per\ncent of the global pharmaceutical market, according to Information\nManagement Group.\n\nEven though low- and middle-income markets are growing faster than\ndeveloped country markets, drug companies continue to make the vast bulk of\ntheir profits from sales in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan, which\ncollectively buy nearly 89 per cent of drugs by dollar volume. Drug\ncompanies always argue that compulsory licences interfere with their R&D\nincentives, but they never admit that developing countries' compulsory\nlicences never affect their monopoly profits in rich country markets. How\ncan South and Southeast Asia's infinitesimal share of the global market\nreally affect R&D incentive?\n\nLie No-8: Abbott: \"[Because] Thailand has chosen to break patents on a\nnumber of medicines, ignoring the patent system ... we've [lawfully]\nelected not to introduce new medicines.\"\n\nTruth: As discussed above, Thailand has not ignored the patent system - it\nhas used one of its important lawful flexibilities for licensing access to\npatented products and processes.\n\nMoreover, instead of Thailand breaking the law, it is Abbott that has\nengaged in an unprecedented and probably illegal withdrawal from the Thai\nmarket, taking seven important medicines, including a heat-stable form of\nKaletra, out of the drug registration process.\n\n To withhold life-saving medicines from the market in retaliation for\nlawful use of lawful flexibilities is not only unjustifiable, it is abusive\nand unconscionable.\n\n\n\nBrook K Baker is a professor in The Programme on Human Rights and the\nGlobal Economy at Northeastern University's School of Law.\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
