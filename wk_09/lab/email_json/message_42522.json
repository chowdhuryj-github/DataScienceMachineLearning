I hate\nlugging a laptop; the dead weight of a screen is especially irksome.\nPDAs with speech are overpriced.  Most seem to run Windows, with one\nexception (the Pappenmeier device).\n\nThere's a group of people who are trying to turn a Linksys router into\na talking portable.  See www.louderlinux.net.  I wish them luck.\n\nDoes your \"slug\" device use an x86 processor?  That would make it\nespecially attractive.\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
