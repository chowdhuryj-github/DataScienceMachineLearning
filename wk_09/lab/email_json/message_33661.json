I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium .As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.My name is iyesa ismaina a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,here in London and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life in a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as\u00a0 a few close friends,and Schools in the UAE. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of thirteen million, Five hundred thousand dollars ($13,500,000,00.00) that I have with a Financial Firm Abroad.I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% of the total funds,for you and for your time.I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations any where in the world and let them know that it is I Iyesa Issmaina that is making this generous donation. I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished as I dont want anything that will Jeopadize my last wish. I am writing this from my Notebook computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to come.You can get back to me with my personal email I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart. \u00a0God be with you.Iyesa Issmaina(Mrs)Walla!
