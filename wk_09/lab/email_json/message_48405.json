I get the picture.  Perfect...if SpeakUp doesn't complain. \nMan, I love that interface.  Especially for laptop users.  Never did \ncare for mice, and like my fingers glued to the home-row on the \nkeyboard.  (asdf-jkl;)  The laptop config makes it even easier.  No \nhunting for the notches on the F and J keys.  If Kirk and Andy weren't \nsuch ugly looking women, I'd propose to 'em.   This is what a \nscreen reader !should! be.  Dunno if I've seen it in X though.  Oralux \nkinda sounds like everything is in text mode, as far as the client list, \nanyway.  A friend at CVALE (Central Valley Area Linux Enthusiasts) also \nsent me a copy of Ubuntoo, I think.  Never got it working.\n     I was thinking along the lines of the old Sound Blaster's \"say\" \ncommand for DOS, where you could have the computer say whatever.  Might \nalso be nice to feed the synth's output back into the microphone and \nrecord things to mp3 or WAV format.  How well does SpeakUp work with \nbitchx, do you know?  Hanging out on openprojects was another bad habit \ni'd like to renew.   Thank you for the info.  You've all been an \nenormous help.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
