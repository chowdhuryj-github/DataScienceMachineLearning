It would be nice if I can remove that one.\nAs we should backup all persistent tdb's before upgrading\nor none.\n\nSo my plan is to move the lib/tdb/common/tdbback.c code into\nlib/tdb/tools/tdbbackup.c and make the functions static.\nThen I'll sync samba 3 and 4.\n\nComments please:-)\n\nmetze\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with SUSE - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGJJaVm70gjA5TCD8RAn0BAJ9ynn1NHg2eWqzGLnTDR0KSr9L1HwCdHq6J\n7fp//3S3rwFuGrf5UHEWM8c=\n=6nnC\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
