I would like to reduce a simulation time -\nsometimes it takes days. I consider buying one of them (I'm working under\nWin XP 32 bit):  \n1. Intel Core2 Duo E6700 2.67 GHz\n2. Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor 3070 - 2,66 GHz\n3. AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+\nOr simple Pentium 4?\n\nI'm very confused because I'm not sure whether R takes advantage dual-core\nor not. If not, probably Athlon would be better, wouldn't be? \nI would appreciate any help.\nRob\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
