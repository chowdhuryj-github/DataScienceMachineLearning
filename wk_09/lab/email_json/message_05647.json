My concern is simply that a defendant in\na situation like this will present the copyright license as\ngranting him the right to do what the trademark license does\nnot allow. \n\nBasically, he'll argue that the copyright license should be read\nto include \"you can use the mark even to disparage us or to \ncreate a false association\". I know it doesn't actually *say*\nthat in the license, but it also doesn't *not say* that.\n\nWhy give someone an argument, even a tenous one, when you can add\nwording that takes away the entire argument?\n\nArnoud\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
