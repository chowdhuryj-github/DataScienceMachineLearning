McDonalds disagrees, and they have organised a petition to change the definition. MPs have joined in too today. Some have signed an early day motion saying that \"McJob\" is a derogatory term damaging to the people who work for the company. \n\n\nAre they right? Have you worked in McDonalds - what is your experience? Or have you worked in another service sector and think McDonalds is a trailblazer as a good employer. Is this all part of a PR makeover for McDonalds? It started with healthy food and now it's about rebranding themselves as an exemplary employer. Let us know what you think. \n\n\nClick here to watch Gavin Esler's interview with the CEO of McDonalds UK Steve Easterbrook and add your comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
