I need to have mail sent from my Linux server which has Fedora 7 on it\nto send messages from pilotalkmail.dyndns.biz out to the Internet I would\nlike to do that with end to end smtp if I could.\n2. I would also like to set Postfix up so that I can have mailboxes for four\npeople on my server and forward their mail out to their regular address.\n3.  I would also like to set up mailman for lists.  So I am assuming that\nPostfix needs to be set up to receive and send both.\n\nI would sure appreciate any help anyone has.\n\nScott\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
