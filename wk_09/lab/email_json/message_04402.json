Pugs does not implement the  \nspec as documented, though.\n\nFile tests are supposed to return something which:\n- behaves as a Bool\n- stringifies as a filename\n- numifies as a file size or as a time, if appropriate\n- propagates a stat object (obviating perl5's magic _)\n\nCurrent Pugs only does the first three, sort of:  the size and time  \noperators return numeric, the others string, all behave appropriately  \nif used as booleans.  This means you mostly get the expected results  \nfor chained tests, at the price of every operator doing its own stat().\n\nMy impression is that junction types aren't really \"there\" yet, so  \nthis is the best that can currently be done.\n\n-- \nbrandon s. allbery  [solaris,freebsd,perl,pugs,haskell]   \nallbery@kf8nh.com\nsystem administrator  [openafs,heimdal,too many hats]   \nallbery@ece.cmu.edu\nelectrical and computer engineering, carnegie mellon university       \nKF8NH\n\n\n"}
