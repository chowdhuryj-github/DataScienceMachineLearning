See the manual chapter 3 page 44 at\n  http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/seqinr_1_0-7.pdf\n  for some system.time() examples.\n\no As pointed by Emmanuel Prestat the URL used in dia.bactgensize() was no\n  more available, this has been fixed in the current version.\n\no As pointed by Guy Perriere, the function oriloc() was no more compatible\n  with glimmer 3.0 outputs. The function has gained a new argument\n  glimmer.version defaulting to 3, but the value 2 is still functional for\n  backward compatibility with old glimmer outputs.\n\no As pointed by Lionel Guy there was no default value for the as.string\n  argument in the getSequence.SeqFastadna(). A default FALSE value is now\n  present for backward compatibility with older code.\n\no New utility vectorized function stresc() to escape LaTeX special \ncharacters\n  present in a string.\n\no New low level function readsmj() available.\n\no A new function readfirstrec() to get the record count of the specified \nACNUC\n  index file is now available.\n\no Function getType() called without arguments will now use the default \nACNUC\n  database to return available subsequence types.\n\no Function read.alignment() now also accepts file in addition to File as\n  argument.\n\no A new function rearranged.oriloc() is available. This method, based on\n  oriloc(), can be used to detect the effect of the replication \nmechanism on\n  DNA base composition asymmetry, in prokaryotic chromosomes.\n\no New function extract.breakpoints(), used to extract breakpoints in \nrearranged\n  nucleotide skews. This function uses the segmented package to define the\n  position of the breakpoints.\n\no New function draw.rearranged.oriloc() available, to plot nucleotide skews\n  on artificially rearranged prokaryotic chromosomes.\n\no New function gbk2g2.euk() available. Similarly to gbk2g2(), this function\n  extracts the coding sequence annotations from a GenBank format file. This\n  function is specifically designed for eukaryotic sequences, i.e. with \nintrons.\n  The output file will contain the coordinates of the exons, along with the\n  name of the CDS to which they belong.\n\no After an e-mail by Marcelo Bertalan on 26 Mar 2007, a bug in oriloc() \nwhen\n  the gbk argument was NULL was found and fixed by Anamaria Necsulea.\n\no Functions translate() and getTrans() have gained a new argument \nNAstring to\n  represent untranslatable amino-acids, defaulting to character \"X\".\n\no There was a typo for the total number of printed bases in the ACNUC \nbooks:\n  474,439 should be 526,506.\n\no Function invers() has been deleted.\n\no Functions translate(), getTrans() and comp() have gained a new argument\n  ambiguous defaulting to FALSE allowing to handle ambiguous bases. If \nTRUE,\n  ambiguous bases are taken into account so that for instance GGN is \ntranslated\n  to Gly in the standard genetic code.\n\no New function amb() to return the list of nucleotide matching a given \nIUPAC\n  nucleotide symbol.\n\no Function count() has gained a new argument alphabet so that oligopeptides\n  counts are now possible. Thanks to Gabriel Valiente for this suggestion.\n  The functions zscore(), rho() and summary.SeqFastadna() have also an \nargument\n  alphabet which is forwarded to count().\n\nBest,\n\nthe seqinR team\n\nhttp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/seqinr_accueil.php\n\n\n-- \nSimon Penel\nLaboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive           \nBat 711  -   CNRS UMR 5558  -    Universite Lyon 1              \n43 bd du 11 novembre 1918 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex       \nTel:   04 72 43 29 04      Fax:  04 72 43 13 88\nhttp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/penel\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
