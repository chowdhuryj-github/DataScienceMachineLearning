So I made a new proxy panel function (calling \npanel.xyplot and passing the x/y/groups/subscripts args) put them in it, \nand they started working well.\n\nOnly problem is that xyplot no longer plots the key; I still pass \nauto.key to into the high-level function, but no key gets plotted. \nWhat's the best way to get what I want?\n\nCheers,\n\nGav\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
