If you licence BY-NC-SA, then commercial uses are reserved from use under the terms of cc, and can therefore be licenced through ASCAP, and renumerated.\nBear in mind that NC doesn't mean that third parties can *never* use your work commercially, simply that they have to seek permission (or obtain another licence, such as an ASCAP public performance licence) before doing so.\nIANAL, ATINLA.Cheers,Tim\n"}
