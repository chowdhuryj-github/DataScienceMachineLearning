Install was a breeze. Suspend and \nresume will work with open drivers.\n\nComplaints:\nWith open source nv driver DPMS will not blank the screen (nvidia does). \nA nasty white smudging starts creeping over the screen. Reproduce this \nwith lid switch or DPMS event (xorg setting or using xset)\n\nWith nvidia resume will fail. The machine will attempt to resume only to \nend up with a mostly black screen and a complete hardware hang. I know \nthis is not a Debian issue and much more likely to be the driver. If \nonly nvidia went open source. Am going to look into some patches (but \nthey are old) http://www.loria.fr/~thome/d600/ \n and take a look at suspend2. I have \ncompiled 2.6.20 kernel and setup NvAGP instead of agpgart without making \nany difference. Gentoo has a great article on 8600 \nhttp://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Get_Suspend_To_RAM_working_on_a_Dell_Inspiron_8600c_laptop\n\nOther Niggles:\nxorg didn't do a bad job on screen, but the mouse is setup all wrong and \nsynaptics need configuring (or commenting) to work properly.\n\nVolume controls don't work\n\nAny other experiences with Dell laptops and suspend, preferable the \nsuccessful ones, I would love to here from you.\n\nDan Phillips\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
