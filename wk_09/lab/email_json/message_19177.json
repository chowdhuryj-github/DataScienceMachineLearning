Currently, I have a\ndata set which contains two variables, the variable of time to event\n(or time to censoring) and the variable of censor indicator. For the\nindicator variable, it was coded as 0 and 1. 0 represents right\ncensor, 1 means event of interest. Now I try to use \"survfit\" in the\npackage of \"survival\". I wrote the following code:\n> rptsurv <- survfit(surv(time,censor)~1,data=x)\n\nBefore I run the code, I am concerned with my 0/1 coding to the censor\nindicator because I did not see any argument in the syntax of\n\"survfit\", which may tell the program that value 1 means event. I\nchecked the documentations and R-help archive, but ended in vain.\n\nWould you please kindly tell me how \"survfit\" treats censor variables?\nIn 0/1 coding, is it the default that 1 means event and 0 means right\ncensor? What if the censor was coded as 2 or 3 instead of 0 or 1? I\nmeans how the \"survfit\" knows the difference. In SAS, if a \"lifetest\"\nprocedure (similar to survfit) is performed, there is an argument\nspecifying which value in the censor variable is treated as event.\n\nI know I could just compare the results from R and from SAS to see the\ndifference. However, I really want to know exactly how \"survfit\" deals\nwith this problem. Thank you very much in advance.\n\nsincerely,\n\nJiang Lu\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
