In general R can compute log-likelihoods\nand AICs for most fitted model objects ...  If it doesn't work,\nyou can post your simple example to the list and get more\nadvice then ...\n\n  Ben Bolker\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
