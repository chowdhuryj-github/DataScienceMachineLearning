Best solution?", "body": "Well its all spelled out on the microsoft site\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/118335\n\nThe 2-GB partition limit is imposed by the maximum number of clusters \nand the largest cluster size supported by the FAT file system. The FAT \nfile system is limited to 65,525 clusters. The size of a cluster must be a \npower of 2 and less than 65,536 bytes--this results in a maximum cluster \nsize of 32,768 bytes (32K). Multiplying the maximum number of clusters \n(65,525) by the maximum cluster size (32,768) equals 2 GB. \n\nThis is just like that 32768 number just discussed, it is FAT16 because\nit's 16-bit addessing (2 to the power of 16). Sixteen bits times the max\nnumber of clusters is 2GB.\n\n>From The FAT16 Partition Size (2.00 GB / 2.15 GB) Barrier\n\nIf you put a hard disk over 2 GB into a machine that is using regular \nFAT (16-bit FAT) under DOS, Windows 3.x or the first version of \nWindows 95, you can use all of it--assuming that you aren't limited by \none of the other BIOS-related barriers mentioned in adjacent sections. \nHowever, to access the full contents of the disk, you must partition it\ninto multiple peices.\n\nhttp://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeGB2-c.html\n\nWindows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) and Windows 98 support \ntwo new partition types (0B and 0C) to support the FAT32 file system. \nThat isn't really DOS ... it's Win9x OSR2. DOS did not support FAT32.\nIt only supported FAT16. If you make a bootable disk from Win95\nOSR2 or Win98, that's not DOS.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
