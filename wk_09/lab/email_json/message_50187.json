I'm thinking of\nloading the user interface as a module at the boot prompt.  Various\nparameters could then call additional modules which support specific\nhardware and port assignments.  That way, SpeakUp would, and would not\nbe part of the kernel.  Being modular in design, both users and kernal\nprogrammers could take it or leave it.  In a previous post, someone said\nLinus didn't care for the way it was implemented...no offense to Kirk\nand Andy.  Then kernal programmers wouldn't have to write code around\nSpeakUp.  There would be far less resistance to including it in the\nmainline kernal.\n     Perhaps if SpeakUp accessed screen output the same way video \nmodules do?  I'm sure the answers are already present in the kernal for how\nto implement SpeakUp, at least for those of us who already can support\nit.  I figure if primative BIOS can access and use a USB keyboard, then\na kernal module can recognise and use a USB synth in a similar fashion.\n  The answer is already in the kernal.  It just needs to be cut and\npasted into the SpeakUp interface and connected.  SpeakUp could then \ncall whatever hardware support module is required or needed, \nirregardless of the platform.\n     If SpeakUp can call on whatever hardware service is supported by \nPlatform-X, then it would just be a matter of telling SpeakUp what to \nuse and how to communicate with the synth.  (Jeez, I need to see the \ncode.)  I'll get this effer cross-platform supported if it's the LAST \nthing I do. \n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
