It is a platform for promoting independent artists in India.\u00a0All the music parked\u00a0on TempoStand is Creative Commons BY-SA license. People are free to stream music online. They can also download music or buy a CD by paying for it and mix it and then share it. \n\n\u00a0\nWe have recently released our first album called - Lights. It is light fusion music with some folk and instrumentals. You can\u00a0listen to the tracks\u00a0at www.tempostand.com\n\u00a0\nWe are not specific to any genre. The more experimental the music, the more we love it. There are plenty of other features we are going to release soon. You can\u00a0go to tempostand.com/updates\n to view our blog.\u00a0We were wondering as to how\u00a0important in terms of creative freedom, is it to offer music download for free? and if we do go ahead and make it free for download, how would it affect us in terms of revenue? I mean would many folks buy\u00a0 CD? I say that because thats one way we intend to support our artists. We also intend to sell merchandise so music is not the only thing but still we would like to\u00a0hear some arguments pro or against the idea. \n\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to your feedback. \n\u00a0\nThanks\nUjjwal Grover\n\nTempoStand.com--\ncode and music _.-. \n"}
