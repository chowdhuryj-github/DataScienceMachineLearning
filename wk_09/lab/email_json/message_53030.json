Unless the weather in Florida dramatically improves, commander Rick Sturckow likely will head for at landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\n\n\"C.J., the showers are not pushing out of the circle at KSC like we were hoping, so we're going to wave off this rev,\" astronaut Dominic \"Tony\" Antonelli radioed Sturckow from Houston. \"We're going to take a hard look at KSC for this next (orbit), rev 219, and we'll also be looking at Edwards.\"\n\nIf Knight decides to divert Atlantis to Edwards, Sturkow and pilot Lee Archambault will fire the shuttle's braking rockets around 2:43:39 p.m. EDT to set up a landing on runway 22 around 3:50 p.m. EDT.\n\nIf the weather improves enough to take a shot at Florida, the shuttle's braking rockets will be fired at 2:50:31 p.m. for a landing on runway 15 around 3:55 p.m.\n\nThere are no other Florida landing opportunities today. There are three opportunities to land at Edwards, but the winds are expected to build up as the day wears on. Given a poor forecast for Saturday at all three of NASA's shuttle landing sites, Knight is expected to bring Atlantis home on the next opportunity, either at Kennedy or Edwards.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
