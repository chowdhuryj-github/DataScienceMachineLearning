My responses are intended\nto match the attitude of the poster.  When the poster starts off a\nthread by implying that the documentation is worthless, and that his\nsuperior programming and debugging skills are going to be of far more\nuse to a new programmer, I tend to lose respect for him.  When he\ncontinues the thread by refusing to point out *what* is wrong with the\ndocs, only asserting that they are \"provably unhelpful\", and then\nstating that he has not the time to \"rewrite them\", I lose all\nrespect.  When he continuously asserts that a built-in function\n\"doesn't work\", but refuses to show any code to support this\nassertion, we sink into the negative, and it becomes blatant dis-\nrespect.\n\nYes, my attitude in response is more blatant and obvious.  I don't\nhide how I feel behind polite-sounding words.  That doesn't make the\nattitude itself any different than the OP's.\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
