Growth is optional. Choose wisely.\n\nNothing can be made of nothing he who has laid up no material can produce no combination.\n\nOther lands have their vitality in a few, a class, but we have it in the bulk of our people.\n\nWhen men speak of the future, the Gods laugh.\n\nBe careful: they have arms, and no alternatives.\n\nThey are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.\n\nGoodness is achieved not in a vacuum, but in the company of other men, attended by love.\n\nThe traveler sees what he sees, the tourist see what he has come to see.\n\nI know there's a Derby out there with my name on it.\n\nNot to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards.\n\nYou get what you set out to do.\n\nNo Fear.\n\n\n"}
