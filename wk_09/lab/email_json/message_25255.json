This package provides a flexible framework for analyzing \ndichotomous and polytomous data under IRT, including the Rasch model, \nthe Two-Parameter Logistic model, Birnbaum's Three-Parameter model, \nthe Latent Trait model with up to two latent variables (allowing also \nfor nonlinear terms), and Samejima's Graded Response model. \nFurthermore, supporting functions for descriptive statistics, \ngoodness-of-fit, ability estimation and plotting are available.\n\nNew features include:\n\n  * The new functions person.fit() and item.fit() compute p-values for \nperson- and item-fit statistics for IRT models for dichotomous data. \nThe `simulate.p.value' argument enables the computation of p-values \nbased on a Monte Carlo procedure.\n\n  * The new function unidimTest() checks the unidimensionality \nassumption for dichotomous data IRT models, using a Modified Parallel \nAnalysis.\n\n  * The new function testEquatingData() prepares data-sets for test \nequating by common items. In particular, two types of common item \nequating are included: alternate form equating (where common and \nunique items are analyzed simultaneously) and across sample equating \n(where different sets of unique items are analyzed separately based on \npreviously calibrated anchor items).\n\n  * grm() now works with the available cases when incomplete data \n(i.e., in the presence of NAs) are analyzed.\n\n  * better algorithms, for Missing At Random missing data mechanisms, \nhave been written for grm(), ltm(), rasch() and tpm().\n\n  * a residuals() method has been added for `grm', `ltm', `rasch', and \n`tpm' objects that computes Pearson-type residuals.\n\n  * factor.scores() and fitted() methods for classes `grm', `ltm', \n`rasch', and `tpm' allow now for NAs in the `resp.patterns' argument, \nenabling thus the computation of ability estimates and fitted values \nfor incomplete response patterns.\n\n  * the fitted() method now allows also for the computation of \nmarginal and conditional (on the latent variable(s)) probabilities; \nthis feature is controlled by the new `type' argument.\n\n  * for more details and other news, check the CHANGES file that ships \nwith the package.\n\nMore information as well as .R files illustrating the capabilities of \nthe package can be found in the Rwiki page of `ltm' available at: \nhttp://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:ltm.\n\nFuture plans include the development of functions for fitting Bock's \nNominal Response model and the option for Differential Item \nFunctioning.\n\nI'd like also to thank all users of `ltm' for providing valuable \nfeedback, and welcome any additional feedback (questions, suggestions, \nbug-reports, etc.).\n\nBest,\nDimitris\n\n\nDisclaimer: http://www.kuleuven.be/cwis/email_disclaimer.htm\n\n_______________________________________________\nR-packages mailing list\nR-packages@stat.math.ethz.ch\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
