I would like to know if there is any\npossible way in which I could view those datapoints that are layered on top\nof each other ...maybe by rotating using latitude to show the datapoints\nunderneath (but then is that possible?)??? - just an idea.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nSam.\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Datapoints-underneath-datapoints-Problem-tf3857288.html#a10928148\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
