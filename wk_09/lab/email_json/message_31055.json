For \nexample the following code works nicely\n\nmydata <- \nread.table(\"http://www.lifetable.de/data/MPIDR/POL_2004.txt\", \theader=TRUE)\n\nBut what happens if I need a username and password (a different site)? \nHow do I do that? Or is it not possible to this in R?\nI tried something like this\n\nmydata.frame <- read.table(\"myusr:mypswd@www.mydata.com/adir/afile.txt\")\n\nbut it did not work.\nI'd appreciate any hints.\nMy platform is Win32 (and I am actually running R 2.3.1, but I guess \n(hope!) this is not the reason. At least I checked the NEWS file whether \nany changes appeared since 2.3.1 which could affect this behavior).\n\nThanks,\nRoland\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
