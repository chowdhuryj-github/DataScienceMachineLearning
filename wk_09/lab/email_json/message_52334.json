Or maybe it just works if installed, Ihaven't tried (unfortunately our plates are still full with lower-level stuff).\n- Bert -On Jun 21, 2007, at 22:01 , Eben Eliason wrote:> Rebecca ->> This sounds similar to some of my ideas for \"Collage\"...allowing> combinations of text, drawing, image, and other media formats in a\n> freeform canvas.\u00a0\u00a0The response there seemed that Etoys was, in many> ways, already providing such a thing.\u00a0\u00a0I think this is a really> interesting area though, and the potential to be able to send\n> multimedia documents around, specifically in an educational> environment, is huge.
