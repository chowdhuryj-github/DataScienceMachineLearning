It looks like you can now \"click\" \non the trackpad which I believe is the reason of the behavior. Might \nwant to tweak the trackpad sensitivity.\n* We can easily tweak mouse speed. I can work on it with Eben (I assume \nhe is the right person to look into this).\n* The key related issues blocks on #663\n* Power button not shutting down the system is indeed the wanted behavior.\n* The icon in Read is actually a Save icon. I added a tooltip but the \nconfusion might mean the icon is not quite intuitive.\n* Your problems opening activities might be related to a journal bug \nwhich is now fixed. Let's test again on the next image.\n\nMarco\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
