It seems that specifying file names in the form \"~/abc.png\"\nrather than \"/home/directory/abc.png\" causes my GS to crash when I open\nthe bitmap device on my Linux box.\n\nThe easiest solution would seem to be to intercept any file names in the\nform \"~/abc.png\" and replace the \"~\" with the user's home directory. I'm\nsure I could come up with something involving regular expressions and\nsystem calls to do this in Linux, but even that might not be system\nindependent. So, I wanted to see if anyone knew of a native R solution\nof converting \"~\" to its full path expansion.\n\nThanks,\nRobert\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
