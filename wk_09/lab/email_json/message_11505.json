Despite their vigor, it seems like game enthusiasts can\nbreathe easily this week. As far as most people can tell, [2]gaming was\nin no way involved. Even the mainstream media is coming to realize that\n[3]gaming isn't always the right place to turn when youth violence grabs\nthe headlines. Just the same, some activist gamers are still trying to\nmake sure their hobby comes out of this unscathed, and at least some\nfolks think [4]they may be overdoing things: \"While I'm all for activism\nfor one's beliefs, I really think this may do more harm then good. As\ngamers, we feel a need to defend our passion, but we run the risk of\nending up looking no better than those seeking to shift blame, while\nfurther disrupting the already-mourning. I say that the thing to focus on\nat this point is simply remembering those lost and cherishing what we\nstill have. Now's not the time for political vendettas, and gamers need\nto step down and just humbly accept the fact that blame will always be\nshifted to the popular youth activities: be it a KISS concert, a video\ngame, or something else.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/20/1944245\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://gamepolitics.com/2007/04/17/dr-phil-blames-video-games-for-virginia-tech-massacre/\n    1. http://kotaku.com/gaming/feature/feature-dissecting-jacks-lies-252914.php\n    2. http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/feature/op-ed-smartbomb-author-on-va-tech-shooting-253949.php\n    3. http://kotaku.com/gaming/va-tech-shooting/msnbc-agrees-with-kotaku-jacks-a-tool-254118.php\n    4. http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/04/19/gamers-to-rally-in-new-york-but-may-be-missing-the-point\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| OMB Website Exposes Thousands of SSNs                              |\n|   from the good-managing dept.                                     |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday April 20, @16:39 (Privacy)              |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/20/1843222          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nmsblack writes \"The New York Times is reporting that an Office of\nManagement and Budget website [0]accidentally exposed at least 30,000\nsocial security numbers publicly online.
