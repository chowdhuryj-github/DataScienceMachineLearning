After 3 plots with your different boolean subsets, you \nend up with 3 graphs side by side.\n\nIf this is not what you want (you asked for this in your first \nrequest), and instead you want 3 curves on the same, single graph, \nuse plot() for the first curve(s) and then use lines() to add the \nadditional curves.\n\nCheck the survfit() object to see how to pick off individual times \nand survival curves by subscripting.\n\nAt 12:09 AM 5/3/2007, Greg wrote:\n>Thanks for replying Robert.
