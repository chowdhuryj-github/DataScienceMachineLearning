But conditions in Florida are expected to deteriorate as the day wears on, with thunderstorms popping up one orbit later.\n\nCommander Rick Sturckow and his crewmates have two opportunities on successive orbits to land in Florida, and three opportunities to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The first Edwards opportunity comes on the same orbit as the second Florida opportunity and conditions in California are expected to be \"go.\" But the wind likely will kick up later in the day and it would appear Sturckow's best chance for getting home today is the first opportunity in Florida or the first at Edwards.\n\nHere's how the forecast shapes up (all times in EDT):\n\n\nDAY...EDT..........DD...HH...MM...SS...EVENT\n\nFri\u00a0 01:12:34 PM...13...17...34...30...KSC: Deorbit on rev 218\nFri\u00a0 02:18:30 PM...13...18...40...26...KSC: Landing\n\nForecast: Scattered clouds at 3,000 and 8,000 feet, broken clouds at\n25,000 feet; Winds out of 300 degrees at 8 knots with peaks to 13; a\nchance of showers within 30 nautical miles.\n\nFri\u00a0 02:43:39 PM...13...19...05...35...EDW: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:49:54 PM...13...20...11...50...EDW: Landing\n\nForecast: Few clouds, winds from 240 degrees at 7 knots with gusts to\n11; no constraints\n\nFri\u00a0 02:50:31 PM...13...19...12...27...KSC: Deorbit on rev 219\nFri\u00a0 03:55:00 PM...13...20...16...56...KSC: Landing\n\nForecast: Winds shift to 200 degrees, 9 knots gusting to 13;\nconstraint: chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles\n\nThe winds at Edwards are expected to pick up as the day wears on, gusting to 27 knots by the third opportunity.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
