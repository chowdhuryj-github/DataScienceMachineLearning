Currently one has it compiled with mysql 5.0.18, but can't get \nit to compile with 5.0.41.  I am having trouble with 5.0.22,  5.0.24, \nand 5.0.37 mysql binaries.  There seems to be some problems with \ndifferent versions of mysql.  As soon as we have a tested version of the \nwindows binary for RMySQL, information for obtaining it will be posted.\n\nWe all appreciate you patiences.\n\nThank you\nJoe\n\n\n> \n> \n>> Would anybody have the experience of that?\n>>\n>> Thanks\n>> _____________________________________________\n>> Dr.Ruixin ZHU\n>> Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology\n>> rxzhu@scbit.org\n>> zhurx@mail.sioc.ac.cn\n>> 86-21-13040647832\n>>\n>>\n>>  [[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
