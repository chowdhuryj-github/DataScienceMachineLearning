I am JUST starting to learn this\nprogram...\n\nI get this warning message 'NAs introduced by coercion' while trying to\nbuild a distance matrix (to be analyzed with NMDS later) from a 336 x 100\ndata matrix.  The original matrix has lots of zeros and no missing values,\nbut I don't think this should matter.\n\nI searched this forum and people have suggested that the warning should be\nignored but when I try to print the distance matrix I only get the row\nnumbers (the matrix seems to be 'empty') and I'm not being able to judge\nwhether the matrix worked or not.\n\nTo get the distance matrix I wrote:\ndist.PxMx <- dist (PeaksMatrix, method='euclidean', diag=FALSE, upper=FALSE)\n\nI tried including the p argument (included in the help for dist()) and\nleaving it out, but that didn't seem to change anything.  I think that's\nrequired for one distance measure though, not for euclidean dist. \n\nShould I really ignore this warning? If so, why am I not being able to see\nthe distance matrix?\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/NAs-introduced-by-coercion-in-dist%28%29-tf3680727.html#a10286358\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
