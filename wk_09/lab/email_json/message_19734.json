And I had it using espeak.\n\tHowever, sometimes Orca seems to \"forget\" that it's supposed to\n\tuse espeak, but keeps my speech rate/key echo settings in tact.\n\tI upgraded to svn orca this morning, and it was working fine,\n\tuntil it forgot my preferences again. I should note, at this\n\tpoint, that espeak isn't available in the GUI preferences,\n\tregardless of version. And in the newest orca, I get a python\n\ttraceback at the end of running orca --text-setup.\n\n\tAnyone else have this problem?\n\n\tGarrett\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
