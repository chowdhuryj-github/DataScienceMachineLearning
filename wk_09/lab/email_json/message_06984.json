The seminar will use concrete \ncase studies to illustrate the impact of the new MRTU market on the bottom-line \nprofit for your genco assets. \nThe workshop will cover the following \u201chot\u201d issues:\n\n What are the main objectives of the CAISO MRTU market?\n What are the key differences between the existing Phase-1B\n          market and the new MRTU market?\n How should you best prepare your genco team (portfolio managers,\n          traders, risk managers, back-office personnel, and plant managers)\n          for the MRTU market?\n How can you formulate unit bids to fully account for price\n          and volumetric risks, operational constraints, production costs,\n          and market mitigation rules?\n How should you formulate unit bids for energy, Reliability\n          Unit Commitment (RUC), and ancillary services to maximize the\n          total expected profits while meeting operational constraints\n          and risk guidelines?\n What SIBR rules does CAISO use to validate unit bids?\n How well can you forecast costs, revenues, profits & losses,\n          fuel consumption, and emissions for units that are scheduled\n          by CAISO?\n How can you verify that the CAISO real-time dispatch is \u201coptimal\u201d for\n          your units?\n What rules does CAISO use to penalize units for uninstructed\n          deviation?\n How much money are you leaving on the table if you decide\n          to self-schedule selected units? Or can you profit by selfscheduling?\n How does a lower availability affect revenues and profits\n          for your portfolio?\n Why does CAISO penalize market participants for deviating\n          from day-ahead schedules?\n What rules does CAISO use to compute bid-recovery payments\n          and charges?\n What are the key risk drivers in CAISO?\n What is the best way to formulate hedging strategies for your\n          genco assets?\n How should you structure CRR contracts to hedge against congestion\n          costs?\n In the long run, will your plants collect enough revenues\n          from the energy, capacity, and ancillary service markets to cover\n          for their operating and capital costs?\n What are the key settlement charge codes in the new MRTU market?\n What workflow processes and tools do you need to check the\n          MRTU settlement statements and invoices?\n What IT infrastructure should you build to automate the bid-to-bill\n          process?\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\nPortfolio managers and traders responsible for formulating\n          and submitting energy, RUC, and ancillary-service bids to CAISO\n Back-office employees who need to gain a good understanding\n          of the new MRTU settlement rules in CAISO\n Power-plant managers who would like to understand the impact\n          of LMPs on their plant profitability\n Genco executives who need a good understanding of the potential\n          impacts of the new MRTU market on their genco profits and losses\n Employees of ISO/RTOs, attorneys, and regulators who need\n          to understand market rules, congestion management philosophy,\n          and mitigation guidelines that are proposed for the new MRTU\n          market\n\n\n\nInstructors:\n\n\nKhai Le, Vice President, \nPCI\nOver the past 30 years, Mr. Khai Le \nhas conducted 400+ seminars on market-based operations, RTO operations, bidding \nstrategies, portfolio optimization, and shadow settlement for utilities and RTOs \nworldwide.
