Then, it is sometimes\na good idea to preprocess the data to present in a tabular format (one\nrecord per line).\n\nFor this purpose, I use awk (e.g. http://www.vectorsite.net/tsawk.html),\nwhich is very adept at processing ascii data files  (awk is much simpler to\nlearn than perl, spss, sas, ...).\n\nI have never encountered a data file in ascii format that I could not\nreformat with Awk.  With binary formats, it is another story...\n\nBut, again, this is my limited experience; I would like to know if there are\nsituations where using SAS/SPSS is really a better approach.\n\nChristophe Pallier\n\n\nOn 6/8/07, Robert Wilkins  wrote:\n>\n> As noted on the R-project web site itself ( www.r-project.org ->\n> Manuals -> R Data Import/Export ), it can be cumbersome to prepare\n> messy and dirty data for analysis with the R tool itself.
