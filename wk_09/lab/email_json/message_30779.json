The program I wrote works as well for doing the reshaping, but it is nice to have it built in.\n\nIs there a way to tell what version of Matrix is installed, and how do we know when new releases are issued?  I installed Matrix fairly recently, and thought I was up to date.\n\n-Scott\n\n---- Original message ----\n>Date: Wed, 16 May 2007 09:32:44 +0200\n>From: Martin Maechler   \n>Subject: Re: [R] Reshape a sparse matrix  \n>To: Scott Hyde \n>Cc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>\n>>>>>> \"Scott\" == Scott Hyde \n>>>>>>     on Tue, 15 May 2007 17:03:13 -1000 (HST) writes:\n>\n>    Scott> Hi,\n>\n>    Scott> I'd like to reshape a sparse matrix generated from the Matrix package.
