So basically, putting a CD or DVD on the\nsame chain as a high speed hard drive is only a problem on very old mobo\nthat don't support independent device timing. On all modern chipsets this\nis no longer a problem, so I suppose the question is how modern is the IDE\nchipset in question. If you're not sure if the chipset supports independent\ndevice timing, pair the CD with the slowest drive of the lot, and use that\nslowest drive for stuff like backups or other files that will not be\naccessed\nas frequently. Also, make sure your system is running at the fastest DMA\nmode possible for the drives, and there are some DMA mode test progs\nthat can help you determine if you're achieving independent device timing.\n\nGlenn said:\nA hard drive in line with the CD/DVD drive will operate mighty slow,\nsince the slower drive determines the speed of the drives in the chain,\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
