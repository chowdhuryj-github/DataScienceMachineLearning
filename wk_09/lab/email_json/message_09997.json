I would like\nto label each bar exactly with the range of values that corresponds to it (\ni.e., print a \"0\" underneath the 0 bin, print \"1-2) underneath the 1-2 bin,\netc.\n\nI'd appreciate any help you might be able to provide, thanks!\n\nMark\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
