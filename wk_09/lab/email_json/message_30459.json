I guess we all do here.\n\nRecently, thoguh, I had to switch to Kubuntu =only= because wireless on my laptop JUST\nWORKED.\n\nI have an HP zt3000 with one of those Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG wireless cards built in.\nIt has been horrible to try to get working despite any instructions found on the\nInternet. The instruction on the site for this (http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/) was\ntricky as it only focused on getting that one piece working and not networking as a\nwhole.\n\nDistroWatch (http://distrowatch.com/) has had ubuntu at the top of their list going back\nto 2005 - its ashame when I know that debian is really the heart and soul of dopey\nubuntu. \n\nIm sure debian would shoot to the top of the list if a few more things (like wireless) \n\"just worked\" like it does with my Kbuntu.\n\nCouldn't someone work on this problem for debian - or talk to the ubuntu people to get a\ncopy to be included in the next release and apt sources?\n\nSomethings I don't mind figuring out and there is a great sense of accomplishment; but\ngetting wireless working is not one of them.\n\n~david (and many other debian users I talk to)\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Be a better Heartthrob.
