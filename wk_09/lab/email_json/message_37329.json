How parrot handles these include paths for other\nlanguages than pasm/pir? I'm mixing concepts? How this is done/(going to be done) on parrot.\n\nWhy my parrot can't find the installed libraries on $prefix/lib/parrot/ ? library.c\nuses relative paths, does it means that parrot does not finds the libraries (on last\ninstance) there?\n\nAnd more comments O:)\n\nlibrary.c:117 -- shouldn't this code must live inside a #if __Darwin__ clause? (refering to the comment)\n\n    /* OS/X has .dylib and .bundle */ \n    if (strcmp(PARROT_LOAD_EXT, PARROT_SHARE_EXT)) {\n        entry = const_string(interp, PARROT_SHARE_EXT);\n        VTABLE_push_string(interp, paths, entry);\n    }\n\nlibrary.c:155 -- The XXX comment should not be there. This function only returns\n                 a boolean value. And it is fine for *NIX\n\nlibrary.c:260 -- set LOAD_EXT_CODE_LAST equal to 4.\n\t\t- this change will drop a +1 on the following line and will make the\n\t\t  for loop of library.c:321 more logical. (use < instead of <= comparisions)\n\n  --pancake\n\n"}
