The mere fact it occurred makes it remarkable.\n\nYou can protect your liberties in this world only by protecting the other man's freedom. You can be free only if I am free.\n\nGenius, when young, is divine.\n\nRigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.\n\nThe first step toward greatness is to be honest.\n\nInstinct is action taken in pursuance of a purpose, but without conscious perception of what the purpose is.\n\n'Tis a dainty thing to command, though 'twere but a flock of sheep.\n\nIf you can run one business well, you can run any business well.\n\nSince grief only aggravates your loss, grieve not for what is past.\n\nYou are a king by your own fireside, as much as any monarch in his throne.\n\nBeware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.\n\n\n"}
