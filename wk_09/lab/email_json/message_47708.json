If you haven't worked with electricity before,\nseasonality comes in many flavors: a daily pattern, with a peak at\naround 7pm; a weekly pattern, in which we use more electricity on\nweekdays in comparison to weekends; a winter-summer pattern, with air\nconditioning and heaters playing an important role, etc.\n\nIn SAS, I could specify an ARIMA with multiple seasonality terms, say\n(1,0,1) with period=24, and (1,0,1) with period=168 (I don't remember\nthe orders I was using).  This is how many studies I found on IEEE\nwere modeling electricity load and it worked pretty well with the data\nI have.\n\nHowever, I can't seem to find how to do that in R.  I've read the help\nfiles a few times, but to no avail. Is it possible?  I hope I'm\nmissing something straightforward.\n\nThank you,\n\nPaulo Tanimoto\nUniversity of Arizona\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
