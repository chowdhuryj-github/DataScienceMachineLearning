Adam Smith, D-Wash., a leader of the New Democrat Caucus.\n      Smith said that the conceptual language that the White House and\nlawmakers unveiled last week was \"by and large, OK. It's not finalized,\nand we will continue to have that discussion,\" he said.\n      Another New Democrat, Rep. Melissa Bean, D-Ill., said in a\nstatement, \"I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve\npatent protections and ensure the competitiveness of America's\ninnovators.\"\n      Ways and Means ranking member Jim McCrery, R-La., said Monday that\nthe main concepts have already been agreed upon among Republicans,\nDemocrats and the Bush administration, and that translating those\nconcepts into legal text will not give rise to many problems. \"I don't\nthink there will be a lot of haggling over the language. We've hammered\nthis thing out nine ways to Sunday already,\" he said.\n      But drug manufacturers also want to ensure that the new compromise\nprovisions apply only to the three pending Latin American bilateral\ntrade deals, and will not carry over to future trade agreements or any\nnew grant of presidential trade negotiating authority.\n      One key part of the compromise aims to ensure that generic drugs\nwill be able to be offered in developing countries when those generics\nare already available in the United States.\n      It keeps intact the five years of \"exclusivity\" for clinical test\ndata that innovative drug companies enjoy under recent trade agreements.\nBut it seeks to ensure that brand-name drugmakers are not able to extend\nthat period in the developing country longer than the clinical test data\nis protected in the United States, subject to certain conditions.\n      Health activists have derided that portion of the deal, saying\nthat\nit changes little from the current U.S. policy. \"The preservation of\ndata exclusivity alone is a gigantic gift to Big Pharma,\" the groups\nHealth GAP, Essential Action, and the Student Global AIDS Campaign said\nin a statement Monday.\n      More significant, and potentially damaging for the innovative drug\nfirms, is the removal of a requirement that countries extend the term of\npatents to compensate for delays in the patent approval or marketing\napproval process.\n      U.S. trade officials said in a conference call last week that the\nintellectual property changes are limited to pending trade deals but\nsaid they did not know the extent to which the changes would also become\na part of future trade deals.\n      \"That's to be determined when we get down to the next [trade\npromotion authority],\" a trade official said. \"When they starting\nwriting TPA, it wouldn't surprise me at all if that's where [House Ways\nand Means Chairman] Rangel started from.\"    By Martin Vaughan\n\nBenjamin Krohmal\nCoordinator - Project on Medical Innovation\nKnowledge Ecology International\nTel: +1-202-332-2670 ex. 17\nFax: +1-202-332-2673\nben.krohmal@keionline.org\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
