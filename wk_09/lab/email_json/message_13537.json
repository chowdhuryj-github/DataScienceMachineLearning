Power plants must compete with growing populations, contend with environmental restrictions and continue to share water resources with irrigated agriculture. \n\u00a0\nState regulators, local decision-makers and the general public are beginning to express concern about the water supply, making it more difficult to obtain secure water resources for energy production\u2014California has a zero-liquid discharge rule; Idaho passed a two-year moratorium on construction of coal-fired power plants in the state based on environmental and water supply concerns; Arizona recently rejected permitting for a proposed power plant because of concerns about how much water it would withdraw from a local aquifer.\n\u00a0\nThis conference will focus on the issues faced by companies operating thermoelectric plants and trying to site power plants in the Western United States as the water constraints take hold. \n\u00a0\nThe conference will also provide examples of producers that are successfully dealing with the constraints. It will provide insight into some of the siting considerations for new power plants and some of the operational considerations of the new technologies in use. \n\u00a0\nWhat Attendees Will Learn\n\n\nCosts and benefits of existing low water cooling technologies currently operational\n\nWater policy and resource management policies affecting the future of water resources in the Western United States\n\nTrends driving the water constraint issue\n\nEmerging technologies to address water constraints\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWho Should Attend  \n\nUtility professionals dealing with strategic planning and energy planning, power plant siting, power plant operations, professionals who work with power plant design, financing power plants, permitting power plants, regulatory affairs, environmental affairs, mechanical engineers designing power plant cooling, energy and water attorneys, chemical engineers in water resources, and consulting engineers managing power plant design projects.\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\n  Click\n                        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n  Renewable \n                            Power Project Finance: The Tutorial\nApril 30 - May 2, 2007\n                            New York, NY \n  A Water \n                            Constrained Future - How Producers Can Minimize Impacts in the West\nSan Diego, CA\n                              May 1-2, 2007 \n   GasFair-PowerFair 2007\nToronto, Ont\n                            May 1-2, 2007 \n  Recognizing and \n                            Recovering Energy Theft\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Cost-Effective \n                            Transmission Technology\nNashville, TN\n                              May 3-4, 2007 \n  Western \n                            Renewable Power Development Summit\nSan Francisco, CA\n                              May 7-9, 2007 \n   Solar Power Project Finance & Investment Summit\nSan Diego, CA\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  Gas Mart \n                            2007\nChicago, IL\n                            May 9-11, 2007 \n  In-Depth \n                            introduction to the Natural Gas Industry\nDallas, TX\n                              May 15-16, 2007 \n  Natural Gas \n                            Transactions, Trading and Origination for Non-Traders\nDallas, TX\n                              May 16-17, 2007 \n  Developing and \n                            Launching New Products and Services for Utilities\nDallas, TX\n                              May 17-18, 2007 \n  Performance \n                            Benchmarking For Energy Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007 \n  Pandemic \n                            Preparedness For Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n                              May 23-24, 2007  \u00a0 \n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
