He\nexplained that his action was in accord with the WTO decision which\nallows developing countries to produce or import generic versions of\npatented drugs for government use.\n\n\"We respect the Thai government decision to issue compulsory licencing\nunder the WTO (World Trade Organization), but what we would like to see\nis the negotiations between the Thai government and representatives of\nmajor drug companies,\" Mr. Boyce said.\n\nThai public health officials maintained that international trade rules\nallow national governments to enforce compulsory licencing of\npatent-protected drugs in cases of national public health emergencies or\ncrises.\n\nMore than 500,000 people in Thailand are living with HIV, according to\nUNAIDS, the UN agency that co-ordinates the global fight against the\ndeadly virus.\n\nAnd some 200,000 patients in Thailand who suffer from heart conditions\nhave blood clotting problems that could be treated with Plavix, but only\n20 per cent of them have access to the medicine, according to the Thai\npublic health ministry.\n\n\"The result of the talks may lead to those companies' decision to lower\ntheir price of the drugs that will be affordable to all and that\ncompulsory licencing may not be needed,\" said the US envoy.\n\nDr. Mongkol said he will travel to the US next month to talk with US\ntrade officials and other agencies concerned on the issue.
