Everything flows. Everything is vibrating.\nThere were many times my pants were so thin I could sit on a dime and tell if it was heads or tails.\nThere can be no existence of evil as a force to the healthy-minded individual.\nI'd rather give my life than be afraid to give it.\nThey come together like the Coroner's Inquest, to sit upon the murdered reputations of the week.\nThe person that loses their conscience has nothing left worth keeping.\nWhere there are large powers with little ambition... nature may be said to have fallen short of her purposes.\nThe easiest thing to find on God's green earth is someone to tell you all the things you cannot do.\nHelp a man against his will and you do the same as murder him.\nA good novel tells us the truth about it's hero but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.\nI never worry about action, but only inaction.\nEven though a number of people have tried, no one has ever found a way to drink for a living.\nAmbition often puts Men upon doing the meanest offices so climbing is performed in the same position with creeping.\nIf I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.\nThere's man all over for you, blaming on his boots the fault of his feet.\n\u00a0"}
