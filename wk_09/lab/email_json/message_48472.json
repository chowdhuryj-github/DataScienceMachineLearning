S'why it took almost five years to\nfinally break down and put the $#%$%&^ garbage back on my computer.  I've\nregretted every single day it has ran.   Never could get W95 to\nconsistantly connect at 56K...even with programming the NVRAM on my external\nmodem and re-writing the .inf file.  That was the main reason I ported to\nLinux.  I could no longer control my own computer.  (Lovingly pets \"his\nPrecious.)  Linux gave me my computer back.  Makes my skin crawl to consider\nhow Microsoft is trying to horn in on Linux.  I !know! they're working with\nthe govt. to eliminate the \n4th Amendment against warrantless searches.  I don't trust Redhat, \neither.  Getting rid of Debian too, because it's too easy to infiltrate \na trojan via dpkg.  Yeah, I'm paranoid, but when you examine the \nevidence...  Bugrit!\n\n> There is.

I was thinking of using something to wipe my WinXP\ndrive \nand fdisk the thing into about 16 different fat-16 partitions and \ninstalling freedos and Win 3.11.  Use it as an emergency dual-boot setup \nin case my Seagate croaks.  I'm running removable hard drives.  I don't \ntrust Windows not to infect my Linux drive.   Give it cooties, \nor something.  Six different OS releases, multiple IE upgrades, and \nthousands of security updates and they still haven't closed the \nemail/address book vulnerability.  They want that sucker left wide open.\n\n> In fact, if you tried to use both speakup and provox in a dosemu\n> session with the same synth, I wouldn't be\n>  surprised if you ran into problems.\n\n     Couldn't be any worse than Narrator and Win-Eyes both running at the\nsame time.   Wouldn't be any less understandable, anyway. \nI'm thinking of getting another couple screen readers working all at the \nsame time.  It'll be just like being right in the middle of a Jerry \nSpringer show. \n     Thank you for the URL's.  I have many of them.  They're just in a \nbig pile in Firefox's bookmarks.  Can't organize them using Win-Eyes \nyet. \n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.8.16/849 - Release Date: 6/14/2007\n12:44 PM\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
