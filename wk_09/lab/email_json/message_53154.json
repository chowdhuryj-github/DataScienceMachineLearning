For\ntesting purposes, these directories probably do not have to be real.  You\nshould probably test the Parrot::Configure object before and after calling\nrunsteps() in order to verify that the non-defaults made it into the object.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
