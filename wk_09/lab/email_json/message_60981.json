Debian cannot relicense somebody\nelse's software unless the license grants sublicensing rights.\n\nIn this case however the copyright holder gives prospective licensees a\nchoice:\n\"you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General\nPublic License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\n2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\"\n\nThe recipient of the software thus can elect to use GPLv2's or GPLv3's\nterms. This is not sublicensing or relicensing, it is simply choosing\nbetween one of the offers included by the licensor. It's just like\nthe \"GPL or 'commercial'\" dual licensing used by e.g. MySQL or Trolltech.\n\nDebian needs a license in order to distribute the software. Debian can\nelect to distribute under the terms of the GPLv3. However to give the user\nmore choice, I would suggest that Debian tries to use GPLv2 whenever\npossible.\n\nArnoud (IAALBINYL)\n\n-- \nArnoud Engelfriet, Dutch & European patent attorney - Speaking only for myself\nPatents, copyright and IPR explained for techies: http://www.iusmentis.com/\n              Arnoud blogt nu ook: http://blog.iusmentis.com/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
