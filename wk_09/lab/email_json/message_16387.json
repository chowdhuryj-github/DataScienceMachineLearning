I would like to compare them in order to know which columns are equal. \n \n The following works, but I would like to have a better solution, and not to use what someone called \"prehistorical loops\":\n \n for(i in c(1:4)) { cat(as.character(i),\": \", as.character(setequal(ar1[i,],ar2[i,])), \"\\n\") }\n 1 :  TRUE\n 2 :  TRUE\n 3 :  TRUE\n 4 :  FALSE\n \n I cannot devise how to use the apply function for this.\n Thanks a lot,\n Federico\n \n \n __________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
