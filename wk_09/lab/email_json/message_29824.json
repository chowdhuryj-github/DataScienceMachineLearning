So you could still use\ncommas (without backslashes) to separate the items over multiple lines.\nSee e.g. http://docs.python.org/ref/implicit-joining.html\n\n> Having punctuation where there is a stop is more natural than\n> having an explicit marker for \"don't stop here, keep going\".\n\nThat's the pro-semicolon reason that makes most sense in all comments\nthat I've read so far in this discussion.\nBut maybe that's just something where you have to get used to.\n\n-- \nThomas Wittek\nhttp://gedankenkonstrukt.de/\nJabber: streawkceur@jabber.i-pobox.net\n\n"}
