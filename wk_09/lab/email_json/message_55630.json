There are no samba build dependencies which is\nthe normal reason to maintain things in our trees.\nWhoever maintains it should move it to its own repo\nand make it a separate project IMO.  But if no one does,\nwe can just keep it in the lorikeet repo so that it\ndoesn't get lost.\n\nWe can host it on samba.org of course if needed.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGgSr0IR7qMdg1EfYRAucoAKDfpDN8cvX7XNmpa2guyUI+uEL3yQCeIBDO\npYJtLHYaMyuA4LNnWB1Zcok=\n=dWlD\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
