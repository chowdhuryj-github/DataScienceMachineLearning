I think there is definitely a\nplace for such languages, which I would regard as data-filtering\nlanguages, but I also think that trying to reproduce the facilities in\nSAS or SPSS for data analysis is redundant.\n\nOther responses in this thread have mentioned 'little language'\nfilters like awk, which is fine for those who were raised in the Bell\nLabs tradition of programming (\"why type three characters when two\ncharacter names should suffice for anything one wants to do on a\nPDP-11\") but the typical field scientist finds this a bit too terse to\nunderstand and would rather write a filter as a paragraph of code that\nthey have a change of reading and understanding a week later.\n\nFrank Harrell indicated that it is possible to do a lot of difficult\ndata transformation within R itself if you try hard enough but that\nsometimes means working against the S language and its \"whole object\"\nview to accomplish what you want and it can require knowledge of\nsubtle aspects of the S language.\n\nGeneral scripting languages like Perl, Python and Ruby can certainly\nbe used for data filtering but that means learning the language and\nits idiosyncrasies, and those idiosyncrasies are often exactly the\naspects that would be used to write a filter tersely.  Readability\nsuffers.  (\"Hell is reading someone else's Perl code - purgatory is\nreading your own Perl code.\")  The very generality of the languages\nmeans there is a lot to learn and understand before you can write\nsomething like a simple filter.\n\nSo I do agree that it would be useful to have a language like the SAS\ndata step (but Open Source, of course) in which to write a data\nfilter.  I have one suggestion to make - use the R data frame\nstructure in the form of a .rda file as the binary output format for a\ndata table.  That way the user can get the best of both worlds by\nusing a language like Viino to manipulate and rearrange huge data\nfiles then switching to R for the graphics and data analysis.  As a\nfurther enhancement one might provide the ability to take a .rda file\nthat contains a single data frame and select columns or rows,\nincluding a random sample of the rows, as a filter.\n\nProducing an R data frame may involve passing over the data twice,\nonce to determine the size of the resulting structure and the second\ntime to evaluate the data itself.  This would have been a horrific\npenalty in the days that SAS and SPSS were developed but not now.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
