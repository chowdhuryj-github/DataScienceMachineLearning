For example, see the\negsingle or star data files that are education specific. But, if you for\nsome reason cannot do either at least give a good substantive\ndescription of your data and the problem you are trying to solve. \n\nIn the code you have below, you have a random intercept for each school,\nbut you remove the intercept in the fixed portion of the call. Also,\ndoes it make sense to model Sex as random? This is a repeatable factor\n(I hope), how can it be treated as a random draw from a population?\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Rense \n> Nieuwenhuis\n> Sent: Monday, April 16, 2007 4:37 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] Modelling Heteroscedastic Multilevel Models\n> \n> Dear ListeRs,\n> \n> I am trying to fit a heteroscedastic multilevel model using \n> lmer{lme4- package).
