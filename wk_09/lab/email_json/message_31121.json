Because of that, the search results \nare quite poor.\n\nAt www.openclipart.org/cchost for example, most of the \nclipart have a very short description, or no \ndescriptiopn at all, and because of that the user gets \n1 to 3 relevant results, instead of 8 to 10.\n\nPlease make it search among tags, and not only in the \nname and description of cliparts, this will increase \nthe search accuracy and wideness.\n\nThanks!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can respond by visiting: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=559969&aid=1582017&group_id=80503\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
