What seems to be the biggest problem\nfor me is the inability to track cursor positioning and to know\nprecisely which buttons are highlighted befor choosing.  Yes, you can\ndo that double speak trick to identify the current position in a list\nbut that is awkward at best and I don't remember right now how well\nthe highlight option works with dialog.  Besides, I don't think the\nversion of speakup on Slackware supports that highlight option\neither.  What I would like to do with dialog is get into the program\nand add logic to set the cursor position each time an item is\nhighlighted.  I think a similar thing was done to the menuconfig\nscript for the linux kernel paatched by speakup.  That is, the\nmenuconfig doesn't position the cursor without the speakup patches\neither.  So, I think it is time to update dialog with such a change\nand see if that can be included into their production path.  I think\ndialog is a cool way to create simple menus with little effort.  I\nfound a similar deal for perl scripts and it *DOES* do cursor\npositioning in its default form; just need to do a little something to\ntheir radio buttons but every thing else works with it.\n-- \nHolmesGrown Solutions\nThe best solutions for the best price!\nhttp://holmesgrown.ld.net/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
