This helps solve some rather annoying problems with my particular computer, specifically the cdrom drive being a little flaky.\n    I've found that Espeak works very well in the virtual machine, and that in general unless I'm doing something intensive--like compilation--the performance is great.\n    I'm actually rather proud of myself in that I was able to do this installation without sighted help, something which I had previously needed.\nI'll stop rambling now.\nThanks for listening,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
