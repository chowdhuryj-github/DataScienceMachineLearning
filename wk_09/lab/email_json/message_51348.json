Even if you\nare not running several R jobs at once, it is nice to do\nsomething else at full speed while a simulation uses another\nprocessor.\n\nOften overlooked is the additional large advantage to be gained\nby using SCSI disks rather than any form of ATA. With today's\nlarge applications and operating systems, there can be frequent\npaging, and a SCSI subsystem will make a large difference in\ncomputer response, at least under Windows. Unless your work is\nprocessor bound, disk I/O is usually what sets the pace. \n\n-- \nMike Prager, NOAA, Beaufort, NC\n* Opinions expressed are personal and not represented otherwise.\n* Any use of tradenames does not constitute a NOAA endorsement.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
