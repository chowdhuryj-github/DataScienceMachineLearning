A very dirty solution to this \nproblem would be to remove \"gnomespeechfactory\" form the configuration \nvariable 'speechFactoryModules' in the file 'settings.py' within your \nOrca instalation directory \n('/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/orca/' by default).  Please let \nme know if that helps.  If that's the case, I'll try to find way to \navoid this conflict without such dirty tricks.\n\nBest regards, Tomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
