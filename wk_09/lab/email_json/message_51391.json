If not, go for the octo-core Mac Pro--- 2 quad cores in one very\nexpensive box).\n\nOn my system I have found that with 5G RAM installed, I can either\n1) launch an R64 session that is truly 64 bit R environment, and address\nvery large objects in RAM, or\n2) do what has been described here and launch 2 sessions (in the command\nline, or batch sessions, or 1 GUI and 1 CLI session) and get nearly full\nspeed out of both... a glance at the system activity  monitor shows both\nprocessors pegged when I do this.\n\nBut if I use one regular R session, I still have a very responsive system\nfor other tasks. Good opportunity to use GnuCash to pay my bills....\n\nI've never tried launching more than 2 sessions, since I only have the 2\ncpus...\n\n\n\nOn 6/19/07, Matthew Keller  wrote:\n>\n> Hi Robert,\n>\n> Here's my 2 cents.\n>\n> 64-bit is a memory issue, not a speed issue per se.
