Analysts are baffled by the move. In addition to running an OS\nX-based operating system, which enterprises may be reluctant to adopt,\nthe iPhone is also expected to have a number of shortcomings for business\nusers, including not having a removable battery and not having buttons,\nwhich would make it difficult to dial while driving says Gartner's Ken\nDulaney. Avi Greengart, principal analyst for mobile devices at Current\nAnalysis, also thinks the iPhone won't be a good option for enterprise\ncustomers because enterprises won't be able to write applications for the\nphone.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/24/1534239\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.itworld.com/\n    1. http://wireless.itworld.com/4267/070424iphone/page_1.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Netcraft Shows Smartech Running Ohio Election Servers              |\n|   from the something-rotten-in-the-state-of-Ohio dept.             |\n|   posted by kdawson on Tuesday April 24, @14:02 (Republicans)      |\n|   http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/24/1735213     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\ngoombah99 writes \"[0]Netcraft is showing that an event happened in the\nOhio 2004 election that is difficult to explain.
