Area-proportional Venn diagramsare a phantastic way to visualize agreement. For the 2-rater scenario thisis straightforward; here are two examples from my own work that were done inR. (I'm far too embarrassed to enclose the code).\nhttp://myweb.dal.ca/partes/venn_example.jpg\n For 3 (or more!) variables, it becomes tricky, but Chow and Ruskey havesolved this recently (see link below).\nhttp://www.cs.uvic.ca/~ruskey/Publications/VennArea/VennArea.htmlI think there is even a Java applet for demonstration purposes.\nIt would be phantastic to have a good R-implementation of this...Unfortunately my own skills are several log units below what's required. Ihave written to Chow and Ruskey before but unfortunately not heard anything.Anyone up for the job??\nBest wishes\nPaul\n\nNina Hubner wrote:> > Hello,> >  > > I am a total beginner with \\u201cR\\u201d and found a package \\u201cvenn\\u201d to > create a venn diagram. > > The problem is, I cannot create the vectors required for the diagram.> > The manual say:> \"R> venn(accession, libname, main = \"All samples\")> where accession was a vector containing the codes identifying > the RNA sequences, and libname was a vector containing the codes > identifying the tissue sample (library).\"> > > The structure of my data is as follows:> >  > > R>   structure(list(cyto = c(\"A\", \\u201cB\\u201d, \\u201cC\\u201d, \\u201cD\\u201d), nuc = c(\\u201cA\\u201d, \\u201cB\\u201d, \\u201cE\\u201d,> \\u201c\\u201d),> chrom = c(\\u201cB\\u201d, \\u201cF\\u201d, \\u201c\\u201d, \\u201c\\u201d)),.Names = c(\"cyto\", \"Nuc\", \"chrom\"))> > > accession should be \"A\", \"B\",.... and libname schould be \"cyto\", > \"nuc\" and \"chrom\" as I understand it...> > > Could you help me?> >  > > Sorry, that might be a very simple question, but I am a total beginner > as said before!
