In my opinion,  \nyou would want it to be the same as 2, in which case you really want  \nthe \"if decision==yes\" option first, and the other option in the else  \nclause. Looking at ?\"if\", it should look at something like this:\n\nif (deletingDecision == yes) {\n\tprint(\"Yes!\")\n} else {\n\tprint(\"Not yes!\")\n}\n\nOr if you really want a third option:\n\nif (deletingDecision == yes) {\n\tprint(\"Yes!\")\n} else if (deletingDecision == no) {\n\tprint(\"No!\")\n} else {\n\tprint(\"Other!\")\n}\n\n> Thanks, Corinna\n> Program:\n> --------\n>\n> deletingDecision = userInput()\n> yes <- c(\"y\")\n> no <- c(\"n\")\n> noAnswer <- c(\"Current R workspace was not deleted!\")\n>\n> # first if\n> if (deletingDecision == no) {\n>     print(\"Current R workspace was not deleted!\")\n>     }\n>\n> # second if\n> if (deletingDecision == yes) {\n>     rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n>     print(\"Current R workspace was deleted!\")\n>     }\n>\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHaris Skiadas\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science\nHanover College\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
