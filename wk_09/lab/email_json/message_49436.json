Security \nprofessionals are another class of people with this exemption provided \nthey perform the cracking to test vulnerabilities in those systems.  Our \nexemption was granted to help us with access to the contents of those \ne-books.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
