(r22496)\n\nMichael\n\n\nAdded:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/registry/reg_frontend_hilvl.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/utils/net_conf.c\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/Makefile.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/registry/reg_api.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/registry/reg_frontend.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/utils/net.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/utils/net.h\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (2007 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23452\n\n"}
