I've searched  \nhelp menus, and google... and I can't find how to make sure my  \npreferences are saved. Since I've seen that there's quite a few happy  \nusers of Tinn-R here... can anyone enlighten me, please? :-)\n\nI am using the latest Tinn-R version: 1.19.2.3\n\nThanks!\n\nJose\n\n-- \nDr. Jose I. de las Heras                      Email: J.delasHeras@ed.ac.uk\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology    Phone: +44 (0)131 6513374\nInstitute for Cell & Molecular Biology        Fax:   +44 (0)131 6507360\nSwann Building, Mayfield Road\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nEdinburgh EH9 3JR\nUK\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
