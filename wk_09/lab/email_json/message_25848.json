The appropriate weight for x_i would then be n_i/(s_i^2). In R, that's n/(s^2), as n and s would be vectors with the same length as x. If all the groups had the same variance, or nearly so, s is a scalar; if they have the same number of observations, n is a scalar. \n> \n> Of course, if they have the same variance and same number of observations, they all have the same weight and you needn't weight them at all: see previous posting!\n> \n> Steve E\n> \n> \n> \n> *******************************************************************\n> This email and any attachments are confidential.
