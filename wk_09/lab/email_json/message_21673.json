Spread Free Culture is about collecting media of, around and about\nfree culture, including video, interviews, posters, etc, which others\nmight use in evangelism, etc.\n\n2.) Spread Open Media is a project that xiph.org is working to launch.\nI'm helping with a logo contest for that project\nhttp://openclipart.org/xiph That project intends to be a massive\nrepository for open media (xiph formats, svg, etc).\n\n3.) http://opencontentlibrary.org/ is a project to try and document this\ntype of content based collection/library. The main two projects I've\nhelped seed are part of this, and it should be noted that these are not\njust remix communities, but communities focused around specific content,\nwith the idea to encourage other more generalized libraries for other\nmedia: video, 3d models, text, etc\n\n4.) http://openclipart.org is still going strong\n\n5.) http://openfontlibrary.org is live and kicking, and now with a logo!\n\n\nOn this, note, I would be more than happy to help advise and/or seed an\nopen video-type project if others would like to get on board with\nthis...ccHost is a great piece of software which alleviates the pain of\na content management system, is extensible and is developed actively by\nCreative Commons and others in the community.\n\n> I wanted to take this time to make sure people have had a chance to look \n> at his idea as written on our wiki and discuss any appropriate sharing of \n> work.
