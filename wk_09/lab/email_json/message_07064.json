I don't expect cairo to support all the bit depths and\nimage formats that exist.  But the problem is that Cairo just doesn't\nhave very good support for 16bpp right now _with_alpha_.\n\nFor starters, from cairo-deprecated.h:\n\n\nSo you can certainly get 16bpp 565 surfaces manually as a _side_ effect\nof create_similar on a 16bpp Xlib window if X is running in 16bpp\nmode.  \n\nBut here's where the problems start...  Given a 16bpp 565 xlib surface:\n\n    source = cairo_surface_create_similar (target,\n\t\t\tCAIRO_CONTENT_COLOR,\n\t\t\twidth, height);\n\ngives you a 565 surface.\n\n    source = cairo_surface_create_similar (target,\n\t\t\tCAIRO_CONTENT_COLOR_ALPHA,\n\t\t\twidth, height);\n\ngives you a 32-bit ARGB surface.\n\nI can understand why; but in our case it's undesirable.  We'd rather\nhave 16bpp, but _some_ kind of alpha.  Like fontconfig property binding\nwith strong and weak.  The current code ensures that all the colors\npossible in the target are possible in 'source', but we'd rather keep\nthe bit depth at 16bpp and get 1 or 4 bits of alpha rather than step up\nto 32bpp.\n\nThere are a few issues here.\n\n1) Since we're running in 565 in X, obviously pixel smashing has to\nhappen if there's any alpha in the pixmaps we're sending to X.  And\nthat's what's killing us right now.\n\n2) Even if cairo did hand back a 1555 or 4444 surface, we'd still have\nto composite it and smash it down to 565.  And pixman doesn't have\nMMX-accelerated code for that anyway.\n\n3) Maybe we should be running in 1555 or 4444 mode instead of 565, so\nthat we could get some native alpha without having to smash pixels.  But\nof course we don't have MMX acceleration in pixman for these formats\neither.\n\nIdeally we could ask Cairo to create a surface of _any_ type we want,\neither 1555, 4444, 0565, 8888, 0888, 0444, etc.  But cairo can't do that\nAFAIK.  That's why I said \"grudgingly supports 565\" and \"it's native\nformat is really 32bpp\".  When I say \"manually create\" a surface, I mean\ntelling cairo _exactly_ what format of surface you want.\n\n> Here are some facts about cairo and the support it has for X visuals\n> of various depths and image formats of various depths.\n> \n> First, understand that cairo provides different backends that allow\n> the user to explicitly create a surface with one backend or\n> another.
