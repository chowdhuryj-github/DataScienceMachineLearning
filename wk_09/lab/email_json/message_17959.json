With this interface we can then\nwrite a web page client or even include the model into custom code\n(command line or GUI).\n\nYou can see some examples at:\n\nhttp://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/rws/ames\nhttp://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/ncidtp/dtp\nhttp://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/pkcell/\n\n\nThe first two use previously built predictive models. The last one is a\npiece of R code.\n\nAlternatively you could use RApache\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRajarshi Guha \nGPG Fingerprint: 0CCA 8EE2 2EEB 25E2 AB04 06F7 1BB9 E634 9B87 56EE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nA sine curve goes off to infinity, or at least the end \nof the blackboard.\n-- Prof. Steiner\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
