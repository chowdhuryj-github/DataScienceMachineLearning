It is primarily intended for\n      producing PDF graphics for inclusion in other documents, and\n      PDF-includers such as 'pdftex' are usually able to handle\n      compression.\n\nIf you are able to contribute a stream compressor, R will produce smaller \nplots.  Otherwise it is unlikely to happen (and it any case would be a\nsmaller contribution than that of the author of pdf(), who is quite happy \nwith external compressors).\n\nAcrobat does other things (not all of which it tells you about), but \ncompression is the main advantage.\n\nOn Tue, 22 May 2007, Chabot Denis wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> Without trying to print 1000000 points (see  finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/42105.html>), I often print\n> maps for which I do not want to loose too much of coastline detail,\n> and/or plots with 1000-5000 points (yes, some are on top of each\n> other, but using transparency (i.e. rgb colors with alpha\n> information) this actually comes through as useful information.\n>\n> But the files are large (not as large as in the thread above of\n> course, 800 KB to about 2 MB), especially when included in a LaTeX\n> document by the dozen.\n>\n> Acrobat (not the reader, the full program) has an option \"reduce file\n> size\".
