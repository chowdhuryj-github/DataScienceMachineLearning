There are little tidbits\nin the manuals on the R site, but I found nothing substative.  I'd like\nto understand these better.     \n\n\tTerry Therneau\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
