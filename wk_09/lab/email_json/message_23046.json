I have decided to re-subscribe to this\nfine group.\n\nI have been trying to find a way to get CentOS 5, the\nlatest release from Red Hat, to work with my ISA\nDecTAlk PC card, and apparently I require the dtpc.o\nmodule to be compiled for CentOS 5...\n\nI have installed the kernel-devel package, 4.5mb, and\nI am still getting a variety of errors.\n\nI was wondering if someone might be able to provide me\nthe necessary  dtpc.o  module properly compiled for \nRed Hat CentOS 5 please?\n\nThere's a script that launches a binary executable for\nactually uploading the necessary support firmware into\nthe DecTalk PC card...  I am not sure how critical it\nis that the dtload program also be properly compiled\nfor CentOS 5.\n\nAny help appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n//Rich//\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
