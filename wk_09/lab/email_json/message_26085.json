Instead of making users issue six different \"data(...)\" commands, I want to wrap them all up in one file so that users issue one \"data(...)\" command and have access to all six data sets.\n\nI had the functions and data loaded in R, nothing else, used package.skeleton() to create the structure.\n\nEdited everything I needed to (help etc)\n\nRan \"R CMD INSTALL --build DetectiV\" in MS-DOS, the package built.\n\nInstalled the zip file.  Everything fine.\n\nIn R:\n\n>library(DetectiV)\n>data(DetectiV)\nWarning message:\ndata set 'DetectiV' not found in: data(DetectiV) \n\nC:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.4.1\\library\\DetectiV\\data contains filelist and Rdata.zip.\n\nfilelist is:\n\nDetectiV.Rdata\nfilelist\n\nRdata.zip contains a file called DetectiV.Rdata.\n\nThis the exact same structure I have in place for another of my packages - and that one works when I issue data(...) commands, whereas this one doesn't.\n\nSo, any ideas what I am doing wrong?\n\nThanks\nMick\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
