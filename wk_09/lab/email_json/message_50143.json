Thank you for the consideration of my question.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"batch format\", but you can use readBin to \n  read bits and pieces of a file, by opening a connection to the file \nand reading from there.  For example, to read a single unsigned byte \nvalue at offset 10000, do something like this:\n\ncon <- file(\"myfile.dat\", open=\"rb\")  # open for binary reading\nseek(con, 10000)\nresult <- readBin(con, \"integer\", size=1, signed=FALSE)\nclose(con)\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
