Demonstrators in cities from Los Angeles to Milwaukee to \n      New York demanded a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million \n      illegal immigrants \u2013 and want to do so before the 2008 election dominates \n      the political zeitgeist. Bill Whitaker will have more on the \n      protests and Sandra Hughes will show us the impact of U.S raids on \n      immigrants in one family. May Day took on a different meaning in \n      Cuba. There was much talk yesterday \u2013 and plenty of anticipation today \u2013 \n      of Cuban leader Fidel Castro appearing at Havana\u2019s May Day celebrations. \n      But as hundreds of thousands of Cubans marched through the streets, there \n      was no sign of Castro. Our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan \n      will report on what that could mean. Even before Congress approved \n      the Iraq spending legislation calling for troop withdrawal, President Bush \n      threatened that it would meet his veto pen should it cross his desk. \n      Jim Axelrod will have the very latest on what happened today when \n      the president got the bill. Continuing our series, \u201cCaught in the \n      Web,\u201d Daniel Sieberg will take a look at the growing obsession with \n      Internet pornography, and how viewing it can be addictive. He\u2019ll talk to \n      one family that overcame an addiction \u2013 and also look at an innovative way \n      to confront the problem. Twenty Texas teenagers who died from a \n      cocktail of crushed nighttime pain relievers and black-tar heroin seemed \n      to know they were doing something illegal, but didn\u2019t realize it was also \n      highly addictive and could be deadly. Kelly Cobiella will report on \n      the schoolyard high called \u201ccheese.\u201d And as spring comes to the \n      Middle East, so comes spring fashion to Tehran, Iran. And with new styles \n      come the fashion police \u2013 really. With hardliners in power, the crackdown \n      on non-Islamic styles is harsher than ever. Elizabeth Palmer will \n      have the inside story from Iranian woman. I hope you\u2019ll join us. \n      Katie For more on two of the stories noted above, please \n      click on the following links: Immigration Rallies Hit U.S. \n      Streets Click Here Bush Ready To Veto \n      Iraq Bill Click Here Here's a look at one \n      of the stories we are working on for Wednesday's broadcast of the CBS \n      EVENING NEWS...
