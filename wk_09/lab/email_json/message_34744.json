[...]\n\nA big one of those concerns is the way it combines barely-related topics\nof copyright and patents into one licence.  The FSF has been warning for\nyears against 'Intellectual Property' confusion, so it is surprising to\nsee the GPL becoming more of an IP licence, helping to spread software\npatent licensing into swpat-free jurisdictions.  Will they stop that?\n\nIn practical terms, it seems to be combined copyright-trademark licences\nthat cause more problems for debian and GPL is no worse in that way.\n\nWhile I'm writing anyway:\n\n>     2.

It's not GGPL.\n\nGood luck,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
