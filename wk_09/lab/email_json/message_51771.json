We take\na lot for granted with distros, it's generally easy to build kernels\nbut the toolchain can be a bear. Note that the enu50.so (the\nspeech engine library) not only required an old glibc, it had to be\ninvoked using old loader. When I did this I had two glibc versions\nand two loader versions on my system. I don't know if there is a\nbetter way, but this approach worked on slackware and lfs.\nI have no idea if that is still true today, apparently I did it three\nyears ago.\n\nAlso from my notes, on slackware I used rpm2tgz to unpack viavoice.\nNow I remember, the rpm tool choked because of dependencies.\n\nI will not reveal how many hours I messed with getting viavoice\nworking on newer systems. An insane amount I think.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
