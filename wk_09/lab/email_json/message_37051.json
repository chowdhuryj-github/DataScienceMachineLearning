Like many\nterms in the Copyright/Trademark/Patent rights space, it gets missused\nby people who are not familiar with it and haven't bothered to consult\na dictionary.\n\n> Free == grants all the important freedoms (see the FSD or the DFSG)\n> Proprietary == non-free\n\nIf you mean non-free, just say non-free. Don't use confusing terms\nlike proprietary, which belongs on the closed/open axis, not the\nfree/non-free axis. Non-free is even shorter that proprietary, so your\nfingers will thank you.\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nBuild a fire for a man, an he'll be warm for a day.
