I would like to\nbuild a matrix which contains each vector of \"returns\". I am thinking about\nsomething as following, but I guess there should be a sensible way of doing\nthis. \n\nreturns <- split(return, list(regimef, assetf))\ncbind(returns[[1]], returns[[2]],...,returns[[n]])\n\nCould anyone give me some advice?
