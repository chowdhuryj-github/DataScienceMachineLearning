Teaching your kids to \n      help pay for their own education is also something she stressed and I can \n      understand.\u00a0 It's never too early to teach a child the importance \n      of\u00a0being \n      self-sufficient!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTomorrow on\u00a0the Early \n      Show,\u00a0one of People magazine's \n      most beautiful people, Drew Barrymore, will be live in the studio to \n      discuss her new film \"Lucky You.\" Another \n      beauty, \"Spider- Man 3\"\u00a0star Kirsten Dunst, will talk\u00a0about the making of\u00a0that trilogy and Il\u00a0Divo\u00a0will perform for us.\n\u00a0\n      \n\n\nJulie \n      Chen\nEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
