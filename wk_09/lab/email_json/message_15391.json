It seems I had two collections of functions in the same\ndirectory.  One by Colin Goodall, and one by David Scott (I have no\nrecord of where he is/was located).  It is the *latter* collection\nthat does all its work from within Fortran.\n\nI'll have another look at what Colin Goodall actually wrote to see if\nit could be useful to guarav.\n\n                                                                 cheers,\n\n  Rolf Turner\n  rolf@math.unb.ca\n\n\n\n============================================================================================\nDISCLAIMER AND CONFIDENTIALITY CAUTION:\\ \\ This message and ...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
