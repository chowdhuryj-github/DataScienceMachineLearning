I really think that this is something that us in the UK could benefit from doing too - currently both MCPS/PRS (for collecting royalties on musical works) and PPL (for public performance of sound recordings) take an assignment of rights, rather than a licence, and consequently are not compatible with CC licences. John Buckman's written an interesting article on music publishing for CC musicians which touches on this issue - apparently it's possible for non-US musicians to register with ASCAP (who take a licence rather than an assignment of rights) rather than a collecting society within their own territory, in order to collect publishing royalties. (This is of course assuming that the collecting societies would only collect royalties on uses that do *not* fall within the scope of the cc licence): \nhttp://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/05/advice_to_magna.htmlI've been in touch with PPL before (and not had much success in getting any useful information out of them), and I gather other people in the UK have spoken to MCPS/PRS about this issue, however, it doesn't seem to have made a vast amount of difference. I'll see if we can't give it another go...\nCheers!Tim\n"}
