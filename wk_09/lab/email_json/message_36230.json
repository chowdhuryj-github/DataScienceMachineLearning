I thought the problem might have come from scripts crashing\nand therefore not getting around to executing the dbDisconnect()\nfunction, but I just ran a script that exited correctly and it still\nleft a giant file in /tmp/ without cleaning up after itself.  I'm\nrunning all of my scripts using the --vanilla tag (saving the data I\nneed either into a separate .RData file or into the MySQL database).\nIs there some other tag I should be using or some command I can put at\nthe end of my script to remove the Rtmp file when it's done?\n\nThank you,\n-Alessandro\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Yaroslav Halchenko\nDate: May 24, 2007 7:42 PM\nSubject: Re: mysql> Access denied for user\nTo: Alessandro Gagliardi\n\nAlessandro\nWe need to resolve the issue somehow better way... /tmp/ gets filled up\nfast with your R tasks...\n\n*$> du -scm RtmpvKEqwr/\n804     RtmpvKEqwr/\n804     total\n\nroot@node26:/tmp\n$> ls -ld RtmpvKEqwr/\n0 drwx------ 2 eklypse eklypse 80 2007-05-24 15:18 RtmpvKEqwr//\n\nroot@node26:/tmp\n$> df .\nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6              1052184   1052184         0 100% /tmp\n\n\nI had to remove it...\n\ncheck if there is a way to use some other directory may be? or properly\nclean up??\n\nOn Wed, 23 May 2007, Alessandro Gagliardi wrote:\n\n> Well, this is a real problem then.
