The third one is not intended for production\ncode; you should 'use diagnostics' only when you're developing code\nand expecting error messages. I say this in part because 'diagnostics'\nhas a significant overhead of both time and memory. Be sure to disable\nit when your code goes into production.\n\n> You have mail.\n\nDon't we all?\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
