The changes that have been\nmade to Samba recently *do* appear to have solved the problems with accessing\nVista.  I'm now able to both enumerate shares and access files on the Vista\nmachine that was inaccessible during my initial tests.\n\nInterestingly, it's now negotiating NTLMSSP just like it does with W2k, which\nit was not doing in my previous tests.\n\nAnyway, it seems that the big problem I thought we had doesn't exist.  That's\nnice to know.\n\nCheers,\n\nDerrell\n\n"}
