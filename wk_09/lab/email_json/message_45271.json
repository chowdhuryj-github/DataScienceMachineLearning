First of all, what are the biggest \ndifferences between the bsd systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, \nand the linux distros, gentoo, debian, etc? From researching and \nreading it seems that there are people that either love or hate one \nor the other. From a security standpoint, what is more secure? Also, \nif bsd is like linux, as it seems to be, could speakup ever be made \nto work with it? Once again, I hope this is not off topic, but, \nbeeing that there are loads of people who understand these things \nbetter than I do, I figured I would ask.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
