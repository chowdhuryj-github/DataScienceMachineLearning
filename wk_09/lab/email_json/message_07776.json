My data have k=3 populations and there\nare 3 variates in the feature space.  When using using the code\n\n   PROC DISCRIM DATA = FOO OUT = FOO_OUT OUTSTAT = FOOSTAT\n                METHOD = NORMAL LIST POOL = YES PCOV MANOVA;\n     CLASS STRATA;\n     PRIORS EQUAL;\n     VAR X1 X2 X3;\n   RUN;\n\nI am able to easily obtain the linear discriminant functions for\nthe strata which allow computation of the three discriminant\nscores for a given observation.  This information is contained \nin WORK.FOOTSTAT and may be extracted by subsetting:\n\n   DATA LDFUNC;\n     SET FOOSTAT(WHERE = (_TYPE_ = LINEAR));\n   RUN;\n\nTo actually implement the linear discriminant functions takes\na bit more formatting, but there it is.\n\nMy question:  Where is this information stored in R?  I completely\nunderstand that predict( ) or predict.lda( ) are the preferable\nways to obtain a classification prediction for new observations.\nI still want to \"see\" the individual lin. discrim. functions and\nwork with them myself.  I have been using\n\n   x.lda <- lda(Strata ~ X1 + X2+ X3, data = foo.frame)\n\nto construct the analysis.\n\n\nMuch thanks,\n\n    Greg\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
