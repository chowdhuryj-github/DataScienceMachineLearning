Since we have not be notified when the sever went back, it has\nnot been uncommented.\n\nI have just uncommented it.\nBut :\n- the DNS resolves in IPv6 while neither the HTTPD nore the FTPD are\n  available by IPv6.\n- there are undesirable non-us directories in debian/ and debian/pool/\n\n\n> 2. http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/ which has amd64 and i386 packages.\n\nFor this one, the admin should add it: http://debian.org/mirrors/submit\n\n> Is there any other place I should update to have these changes appear in the debian installers (lenny/sid).\n\nNo need, since choose-mirror updates its list at build time.\n\n> Any chance to have it updated in Etch's next stable release?\n\nWe can ask the debian-installer team to rebuild choose-mirror in the\ncase no rebuild was planned.\n\nRegards,\n\n-- \nSimon Paillard\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-mirrors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
