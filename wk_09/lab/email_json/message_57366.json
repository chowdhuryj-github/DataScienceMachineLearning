Vista Ultimate includes Media Center, DVD Maker, and Movie \nMaker \u2014 multimedia features of Home Premium that aren't in Vista \nEnterprise.  Also, Ultimate offers BitLocker drive encryption, support \nfor Unix-based apps, and Virtual PC Express, which Home Premium does \nnot.\n\nBut third-party multimedia and encryption features can easily be added to \nVista Home Premium and Vista Enterprise via downloads. The real allure of \nVista Ultimate was something that none of the other editions \nwould ever have: Ultimate Extras. Some of Microsoft's promises for \nthese Extras are shown in a Help screen in Vista's Windows Update control \npanel (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: In the task pane of Vista's Windows Update control panel, \nyou can click Learn about Windows Ultimate Extras to display \nthe things Microsoft promised.\n\nSummarizing this feature, the \nmarketing site \nfor Windows Vista Ultimate states, \"These cutting-edge programs, \ninnovative services, and unique publications provide a richer \ncomputing experience for Windows Vista Ultimate users.\"\n\nAs indicated on the Vista Ultimate \nsite, \nthree Extras were released in connection with the launch of the product \nitself in January of this year. These were:\n\n\u2022 Language packs for the Multilingual User Interface (MUI).\n\n\u2022 Enhancements for Vista Enterprise's BitLocker and its \nEncrypting File System (EFS). Some sources, including the Microsoft \nmarketing site \nfor Ultimate, count these as two separate Extras.\n\n\u2022 A poker game in which you play \"Hold 'Em\" against the \ncomputer.\n\nSince January, no completed Extras have been released. A pre-release \nversion of Windows DreamScene \u2014 which lets you display videos \nas screen savers on your desktop, something that was possible with previous Windows versions using HTML \u2014 has been available for download \nsince March, but no finished version has yet been offered.\n\n\n\n\nUltimate users start to notice \u2014 and complain\n\n\n\nThe absence of new Extras has not been lost on the online community, \nsome of whom are beginning to complain vociferously in their blogs. \nFor example, a commenter named Larry on \nJosh's Windows Connected \nblog opines, \"It's high time someone brought this scam to light. \n$400 for Vista Ultimate, and nothing about it has been ultimate so \nfar.\"\n\nKeith Carey, another poster on the same site, echoes the sentiments \nof many that even the few existing Extras are nothing special. \n\"Ultimate has been a three trick pony with 1 trick few use (BitLocker), \none that is so-so (Texas Hold'em) , and the other more of a preview \n(DreamScene),\" he writes. \"If this was a standalone product and not \na version [of an operating system], we would be calling it vaporware.\"\n\nWindows Secrets contributing editor Woody Leonhard goes further, saying, \n\"The BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool really is a prerequisite for \nusing BitLocker, unless you perform a clean install.\" \nEven then, he points out, \"You have to go through some extraordinary machinations, from the command prompt, prior to installation.\" (The steps \nare explained in a forum posting by developer \nMark Minasi.) \nLeonhard concludes that the Drive Preparation Tool should have been part \nof Vista Enterprise in the first place and is hardly an Extra.\n\nIn addition, the MUI language packs are not unique to the Ultimate Extra \nprogram. They're available to all Vista Enterprise purchasers who used \nMicrosoft's Volume Licensing Program (as large enterprises typically would), \naccording to infrastructure design consultant  \nRaymond Comvalius.\n\nAdding mystery to the mix, one blogger, \nLong Zheng, \nclaims that a confidential source has revealed to him the real reason \nwhy Microsoft's video screen saver has been released in final form. \nDreamscene Extra, he writes, has such serious code problems that the \ncompany may have to keep it in perpetual beta. Dreamscene, for example, \nis reportedly unable to work properly on systems configured to use \nright-to-left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew \u2014 an unbelievable \narchitectural flaw for a product that Microsoft would like to \nmarket as finished.\n\nWhy is Microsoft not following through on its Ultimate Extra promises? \nBlogger Zheng has his own theory:\n\n\n\n\"Another reliable source suggested there is not even an Ultimate team \nin existence anymore. Some suggest there were never a team to begin \nwith, more of a collection of people all over Microsoft who worked with \nmarketing on Ultimate Extras. This would explain the lack of direction, \ninsight and progress on Ultimate Extras if no one's responsible for \nit anymore.\"\n\nFor its part, Microsoft officially maintains the position that nothing is \nwrong. Asked about the lack of Extras or whether the responsible \nteam has been disbanded, a Microsoft spokesman responded only \nthat:\n\n\n\"We've released four Windows Vista Ultimate Extras this year \n\u2014 Windows Hold 'Em, Language Packs for the Windows \nmulti-language user interface, Secure Online Key Backup, and \nBitLocker Drive Preparation Tool. We plan to release more in \nthe future. We have no additional updates at this time.\"\n\n\nMore than 30% of Windows Vista buyers choose the Ultimate version, \naccording to March 2007 figures quoted by the \niTechNote \nblog. Many of these purchasers selected Ultimate on the promise of its Extras \nalone.\n\nIn my opinion, Microsoft has an ethical obligation to honor \nits own marketing hype and follow through with useful tools in a \ntimely way.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

Is this right? Three are \nfor System, two are for Network Service, and one is for Local \nService. The highest memory usage is not more than 32,124 K, \nwhich is in System. I don't know if I should be \nconcerned.\"\n\nYes, this is very normal. Svchost.exe is a component of Windows \nthat runs services (processes like audio, fax, network functions, and \nmuch more). Multiple instances of Svchost.exe \ntypically run at the same time, each instance loading one or more \nservices. Unfortunately, Task Manager doesn't show which service(s) \neach instance is running.\n\nYou can find more information on Svchost.exe in Microsoft's \nKnowledge Base article \n314056. \nTo see what services normally run on your system, click Start, Run, \ntype Services.msc, and press Enter.\n\n\n\nHow to check Windows Update's version number\n\n\n\nThe \nsame story \ndiscussed the need to update the Windows Update client. But reader \nSuzanne Lutkoff had this question:\n\n\n\n\"I cannot find the information on which version of Windows Update \nI am running. Have looked in all the logical places. My laptop is \nset for Automatic Updates, and I don't always get to see what's \nbeing updated.\"\n\nTo learn whether you have the latest version of Windows Update, \nuse Windows Explorer to go to the Windows\\System32 folder and look \nfor a file called Wuaueng.dll (if your configured language is English). \nRight-click that file and choose Properties. Click the Version tab and \nthen select File Version under Item name. If the \"value\" (version) \ndisplayed is 7.0.6000.374 or above, then you have the needed fix.\n\n\n\nDownload pages posted for ZoneAlarm's Vista versions\n\n\n\nA few readers were confused about how to find \nthe new Vista versions of ZoneAlarm software that I discussed in the \nJune 21 issue.  Fortunately, Daniel Mitchell found a solution:\n\n\n\n\"The only way I could figure out to get the software is to download \na 'trial version' with a 15-day limit, and then enter the unique \nproduct code identifier when the software asked me to 'purchase the \nsoftware.' \"\n\nFor those who still need to get \ntheir Vista upgrade, Jaan Warnhoff of Sweden sent us a link to the \ndownload page \nhe received from Check Point Software customer service. \nRecently, Zone Labs has also added a \npage \nthat discusses its ZoneAlarm Vista products.\n\nReaders Mitchell and Warhoff will receive gift certificates for \na book, CD, or DVD of their choice for being the first to send \nus tips that we printed.\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.
