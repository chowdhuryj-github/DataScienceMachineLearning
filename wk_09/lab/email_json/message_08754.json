Not only is it\nimpossible to make the users list visible but it is also impossible to change\nthe login appearance (other features such as passwordless users do work\nhowever).\n\nSomething like \"Users who intend to customize KDM (appearance and/or\nfunctionalities) should not use the desktop-base package\" should be clearly\nvisible somewhere (I spent quite some time finding that I needed to purge the\ndesktop-base for my settings to be taken into account).\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\n"}
