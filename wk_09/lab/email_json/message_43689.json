This is also provided in\n\"strucchange\" along with a rich set of other testing (and dating)\ntechniques.\n\nBest,\nZ\n\n> Thanks, Bernd\n> --\n> View this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Chow-Test-tf3878416.html#a10990270\n> Sent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
