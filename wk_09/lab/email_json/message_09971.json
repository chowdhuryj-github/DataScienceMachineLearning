The attributes of the various DER facilities currently available can address many of a utility\u2019s needs, such as:\n\n\nSatisfying the renewable requirements being legislated through the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)\n\nRelieving congestion on transmission lines\n\nDeferring capital investment in generation assets\n\n\n\nBut, even the most DER \u201cfriendly\u201d utilities are rightfully concerned about loss of revenue, contractual arrangements and risk management.\nUtilities are facing new situations like:\n\n\nA DER facility may be positioned perfectly to provide VAR support, but the utility\u2019s tariff arrangements do not provide for its customers to supply VARs\n\nA new CHP is proposed at a manufacturing facility that is located on a \u201csoft\u201d portion of a utility\u2019s grid. How can the utility make arrangements for the potential support that may be provided by the new generation?\n\nA large pulp and paper facility wants to provide surplus power that may violate wheeling regulations. How can the surplus be accommodated?\n\nThe new frozen food packaging facility is looking at a site analysis that suggests a CHP facility will be the deciding factor on where to locate\u2014inside your territory or on the grid of the competing utility in the next county\u2014what rate structure\n          will be profitable for both parties and keep the facility in your revenue stream?\n\nA children\u2019s hospital needs to ensure power is available when disaster strikes, and has a need for increased thermal energy. What arrangements can be made to use a CHP facility as a standby energy resource?\n\n\n\nNew market opportunities are fueled by state interconnection standards, renewable portfolio standards, and municipalities that are moving toward sustainability programs. At the same time, new technologies are making small generating units more efficient and renewable qualified. Utilities are faced with a matrix of opportunities for distributed energy resources that will be shaped by regional situations. New ownership, operation and maintenance models may also provide the mechanism that makes a DER profitable for all involved. These market changes require a new business model that incorporates legislated requirements, greening efforts, and new technologies.\nThis conference is designed to summarize the factors that are reshaping the DER market and highlight business models that may create a favorable agreement for utilities.\nEUCI, a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric industry, has assembled experts to explore new business models that utilities are using to profitably integrate distributed generation into their portfolio mix.\nWho Should Attend\n\n\nUtility professionals in systems planning, DER rate design, or DER contracts\n\nMunicipalities considering or currently operating a DER program\n\nInstitutional facilities considering or currently operating a DER program\n          DER developers, consultants, manufacturers and potential DER owners\n\n\n\nWhy Attend?\nSeveral factors are coming together to change the shape of the market for integrating distributed energy resources into the utility\u2019s portfolio. This conference will highlight the impact of the market changes on distributed energy resources and provide some business models that utilities are beginning to implement to profitably incorporate distributed generation into utility operations.\nWhat You Will Learn\n\n\nAn update on the RPS standards incorporating DER\n\nAn overview of some of the technological advancements that are impacting DER integration\n\nHow CHP facilities are being used to improve energy security in Texas\n\nEmerging business models that help to integrate DER profitably into a utility\u2019s system\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\n\nUpcoming \nConferences\n  3rd Annual \n  Renewable Portfolio Standards\nWestminster, CO\n    April 23-24, 2007\n  Improving \n  Utility Performance and Compliance Through Business Process \n  Management and Optimization (BPM/BPO)\nSacramento, CA\n    April 23-24, 2007\n  Maximizing Value \n  of Genco Assets in CAISO MRTU Market\nSacramento, CA\n    April 23-24, 2007\n  A Water \n  Constrained Future - How Producers Can Minimize Impacts in the West\nSan Diego, CA\n    May 1-2, 2007\n  Recognizing and \n  Recovering Energy Theft\nNashville, TN\n    May 3-4, 2007\n  Cost-Effective \n  Transmission Technology\nNashville, TN\n    May 3-4, 2007\n  Western \n  Renewable Power Development Summit\nSan Francisco, CA\n    May 7-9, 2007\n   Solar Power Project Finance & Investment Summit\nSan Diego, CA\n  May 9-11, 2007\n  Gas Mart \n  2007\nChicago, IL\n  May 9-11, 2007\n  In-Depth \n  introduction to the Natural Gas Industry\nDallas, TX\n    May 15-16, 2007\n  Natural Gas \n  Transactions, Trading and Origination for Non-Traders\nDallas, TX\n    May 16-17, 2007\n  Developing and \n  Launching New Products and Services for Utilities\nDallas, TX\n    May 17-18, 2007\n  Performance \n  Benchmarking For Energy Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n    May 23-24, 2007\n  Pandemic \n  Preparedness For Utilities\nSeattle, WA\n    May 23-24, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
