It will have a core of veteran players who set the standards. They will not accept defeat.\n\nWeep not that the world changes -- did it keep a stable, changeless state, it were cause indeed to weep.\n\nIt's no use saying, ''We are doing our best.'' You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary.\n\nWhat helps people, helps business.\n\nMore firm and sure the hand of courage strikes, when it obeys the watchful eye of caution.\n\nI'm very brave generally, he went on in a low voice: only today I happen to have a headache.\n\nA sedentary life is the real sin against the Holy Spirit. Only those thoughts that come by walking have any value.\n\nWithout winners, there wouldn't even be any civilization.\n\nNever open the door to a lesser evil, for other ones invariably slink in after it.\n\n\n"}
