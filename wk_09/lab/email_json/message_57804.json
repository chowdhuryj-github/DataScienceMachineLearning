However, you also use Qt, and you can't change\nthe license or add an exception to Qt. Only Trolltech can, as they're\nthe copyright holder.\n\nSo, you have three choices:\n  * Convince the OpenSSL developers to relicense - difficulty: pretty\nmuch impossible\n  * Use GNUTLS instead - difficulty: depends on what the app actually does\n  * Stop using Qt - which could make the app pointless (if the app was\ndeveloped specifically for Qt environments or something) or require a\nrewrite of all the GUI code at the least.\n\n-- \nAndrew Donnellan <><\najdlinuxATgmailDOTcom (primary)    ajdlinuxATexemailDOTcomDOTau (secure)\n     http://andrewdonnellan.com    http://ajdlinux.wordpress.com\n         ajdlinux@jabber.org.au    hkp://subkeys.pgp.net 0x5D4C0C58\n            http://linux.org.au    http://debian.org\n        Spammers only === ajdspambucket@exemail.com.au ===\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
