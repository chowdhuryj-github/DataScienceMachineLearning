It is like a life, so quickly when we don't watch it, and so slowly if we do.\n\nThat low vice, curiosity!\n\nIdeas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the door is just one more good idea.\n\nCalumny is only the noise of madmen.\n\nHow things look on the outside of us depends on how things are on the inside of us.\n\nNo one worth possessing can be quite possessed.\n\nA cathedral, a wave of storm, a dancer's leap, never turn out to be as high as we had hoped.\n\nWe may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine-gun.\n\nI believe love produces a certain flowering of the whole personality which nothing else can achieve.\n\nThere can be no daily democracy without daily citizenship.\n\nIf a man fools me once, shame on him. If he fools me twice, shame on me.\n\nA rich man without charity is a rogue and perhaps it would be no difficult matter to prove that he is also a fool.\n\n\n"}
