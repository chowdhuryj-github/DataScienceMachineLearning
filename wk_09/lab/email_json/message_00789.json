On my work machine I have R,\nS-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, and a couple of other stats programs; on my laptop\nand home computers I have R installed.  So, if a deadline is looming and\nI am working on a project mainly in R, it is easy to work on it on the\nbus or at home (or in a boring meeting), the same does not work for a\nSAS or SPSS project (Hmm, thinking about this now, maybe I need to do\nless in R :-).\n\nR and S-PLUS are very flexible/customizable, if you have a certain plot\nthat you make often you can write your own function/script to do it\nautomatically, most other programs will give you their standard, then\nyou have to modify it to meet your specifications.  With sweave (and the\nodf and html extensions) you can automate whole reports, very useful for\nthings that you do month after month.\n\nAnd what I think is the biggest advantage of R and S-PLUS is that they\nstrongly encourage you to think about your data.  Other programs (at\nleast that I am familiar with) tend to have 1 specific way of treating\nyour data, and expect you to modify your data to fit that programs\nmodel.  These models can be overrestrictive (force you to restructure\nyour data to fit their model) or underrestrictive (allow things that\nshould really be separate data objects to be combined into a single\n\"dataset\") and sometimes both.  S on the other hand allows many\ndifferent ways to store and work with your data, and as you analyze the\ndata, different branches of new analysis open up depending on early\nresults rather than just getting stock output for a procedure.  If all\nyou want is a black box where data goes in one end and a specific answer\ncomes out the other, then most programs will work; but if you want to\nreally understand what your data has to tell you, then R/S-PLUS makes\nthis easy and natural.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
