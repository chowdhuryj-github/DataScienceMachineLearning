I looked back at your\noriginal code and noticed a bug:\n         system( \"perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0\")\n           or die \"Couldn't run the vplan_all.pl script: $!\\n\";\n\nThis should be\n\n         system( \"perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0\") == 0\n           or die \"Couldn't run the vplan_all.pl script: $!\\n\";\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
