With the intel\nchip in the new mac, just boot a live cd or install a conventional\ndistro and you should be on your way.  If the drivers for the mac\nhardware are too different, though, from those for hardware under\nx-86, you might encounter some trouble there.  I have never tried it,\nbut I don't see that you should have any trouble with it.  \n\n\n\nHope this helps. \n\n\n\n\n-- \nSpie Smith: C.S.F.C.\nComputer Scientist For CHRIST\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
