I can also use  \npredict.drc() to yield response values given a dose. I need to do the  \nopposite, estimate a dose given the response. The general predict  \ndocumentation seems to say that this is possible, but it does not  \nappear that predict.drc has that capability. This makes sense because  \nit is easy to compute y values from x values, given the fitted  \nequation, but it is hard to do the opposite.\n\nIt seems that I need to do some kind of successive approximation. Is  \nthere a package that takes a multdrc generated model and estimates  \ndose given response?\n\nThank you all for your time,\n\nJohn\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
