I want to run\nLinux on it as it's probably going to be the best os for the hardware\nthat the computer will have in it.  One of the things that I want to do\nis run an echo link interface to the local ham radio repeater here in\nMuskegon.  On the web site for echo link, the only mention of the\nsoftware running with Linux is by using wine.  Now I'm not the brightest\nbulb in the box, but I'm thinking that wine is some sort of graphical\nprogram.  Is this the case, and if it is, does speakup or any speech\nsoftware for that matter read this particular program at all?  \n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\n \n\nChris Schulte\n\n \n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n__________ NOD32 2191 (20070415) Information __________\n\nThis message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system. http://www.eset.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
