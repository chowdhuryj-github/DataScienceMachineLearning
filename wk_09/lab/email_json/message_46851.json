This \nwill help us get ready for the next release of parrot: 0.4.13, scheduled \nfor Tuesday 19 June 2007. You'll find C, parrot assembly, perl, \ndocumentation, and plenty of tasks to go around. Core developers will be \navailable most of the day to answer questions.\n\nNo experience with parrot necessary.\n\nThanks in advance for your patches and commits,\nAllison\n\n"}
