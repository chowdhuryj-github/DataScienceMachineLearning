In Defeat: Defiance. In Victory: Magnanimity. In Peace: Goodwill.\nI strive to be brief, and I become obscure.\nWhen you have no basis for an argument, abuse the plaintiff.\nFirst you jump off the cliff and you build wings on the way down.\nTo live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.\nThe scars you acquire while exercising courage will never make you feel inferior.\nYou will be better advised to watch what we do instead of what we say.\nTo get what you want, STOP doing what isn't working.\nCensure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent.\nThe rate of interest acts as a link between income-value and capital-value\nOnly the wisest and the stupidest of men never change.\nThough it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve.\nNeither irony or sarcasm is argument.\nActing is a matter of giving away secrets.\nIn my case, adulthood itself was not an advance, although it was a useful waymark.\nWe can never be certain of our courage until we have faced danger.\nFear is met and destroyed with courage.\n\u00a0"}
