We would like to thank everyone in\nthe Samba community that help to test the preview snapshots and\nrelease candidates.  We believe that the this production release\nis in much better shape due to your help.\n\nMajor features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:\n\n  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.\n  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join'\n    process.\n  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and\n    per domain backends.\n  o New plug-in interface for the \"winbind nss info\" parameter.\n  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of\n    inotify on Linux.\n  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS\n    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side\n    by side on the Same server.\n  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including\n    improved read performance with Linux servers.\n  o Man pages for IdMap and VFS plug-ins.\n\nSecurity Fixes included in the Samba 3.0.25 release are:\n\n  o CVE-2007-2444\n\tVersions: Samba 3.0.23d - 3.0.25pre2\n\tLocal SID/Name translation bug can result in\n\tuser privilege elevation\n\n  o CVE-2007-2446\n\tVersions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24\n\tMultiple heap overflows allow remote code execution\n\n  o CVE-2007-2447\n\tVersions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24\n\tUnescaped user input parameters are passed as\n\targuments to /bin/sh allowing for remote command\n\texecution\n\n\nOff-line Logons and AD Site Support\n===================================\n\nWinbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly\nimproved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating\ndomain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site\ninformation.\n\n\nNew IdMap Interface for Winbindd\n================================\n\nThe 3.0.25 release of Samba includes a rewritten IdMap interface\nfor winbindd which replaces the \"idmap backend\" parameter.  Please\nrefer to the \"idmap domains\" description in the smb.conf(5) man\npage for more details.\n\n\nDynamic DNS Updates\n===================\n\nThe \"net ads join\" command is now able to register the host's DNS A\nrecords with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This\nfeature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate\nwhen running the ./configure script.  There is also a related \"net ads\ndns\" command for refreshing a host's records which could be launched\nfrom a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.\n\n\nSupport for Additional ACL Modules\n==================================\n\nSamba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer\nwhich means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations\non the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.\n\n\nVFS ReadAhead Plugin\n====================\n\nWindows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved\nperformance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin\nallows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers\nfor caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving\nVista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between\nLinux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead\nmodule by adding the following lines to the share definition\nin smb.conf:\n\n[file_share]\n\tvfs objects = readahead\n\nNote that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements\ndue to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.\nPlease refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.\n\n\nWindows Vista, Office 2007, and Offline Files\n=============================================\n\nResearch surrounding offline files, Windows Vista, and Microsoft\nOffice 2007 has revealed a incompatibility between these\napplications and the \"map acl inherit = no\" setting in smb.conf.\nUsers requiring support client side caching (csc) and offline\nfiles are encouraged to enable the \"map acl inherit\" for any\naffected share definitions in the server's configuration.\nFuture versions of Samba will enable this setting by default.\n\nPlease refer to the smb.conf(5) man page for more details on\n\"map acl inherit\".\n\n\nsmb.conf Parameter Changes\n==========================\n\nPlease refer to the smb.conf(5) man page for full details.\n\n\n    Parameter Name                      Description     Default\n    --------------                      -----------     -------\n    change notify timeout\t\tRemoved \tn/a\n    change notify\t\t\tNew\t\tYes\n    debug prefix timestamp              New             No\n    fam change notify\t\t\tRemoved\t\tn/a\n    idmap domains\t\t\tNew\t\t\"\"\n    idmap alloc backend\t\t\tNew\t\t\"\"\n    idmap cache time\t\t\tNew             900\n    idmap negative cache time           New             120\n    kernel change notify\t\tPer share\tYes\n    lock spin count                     Removed         n/a\n    max stat cache size \t\tModified \t1024KB\n    printjob username\t\t\tNew\t\t%U\n    winbind normalize names\t\tNew\t\tno\n\n\n================\nDownload Details\n================\n\nThe uncompressed tarballs and patch files have been signed\nusing GnuPG (ID 6568B7EA).
