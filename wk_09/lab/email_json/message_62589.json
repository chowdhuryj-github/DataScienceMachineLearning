[...] 'The existence of this wave means that the electrons\non the surfaces of copper, iron, beryllium and other metals behave like\nwater on a lake's surface,' says Diaconescu, a postdoctoral research\nassociate in the Condensed Matter Group of the physics department at UNH.\n'When a stone is thrown into a lake, waves spread radially in all\ndirections. A similar wave can be created by the electrons on a metal\nsurface when they are disturbed, for instance, by light.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/04/2121258\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070704144743.htm\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| MPAA Sets Up Fake Site to Catch Pirates                            |\n|   from the be-sure-to-include-your-social-security-number dept.    |\n|   posted by samzenpus on Wednesday July 04, @19:08 (The Internet)  |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/04/2212213              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nthefickler writes \"Media Defender, a company which does the dirty work\nfor the MPAA, [0]has been caught setting up 'dummy' websites in an\nattempt to catch those who download copyrighted videos. The site,\nMiiVi.com, complete with a user registration, forum, and \"family filter\",\noffered complete downloads of movies and \"fast and easy video downloading\nall in one great site.\" But that's not all; MiiVi also offered client\nsoftware to speed up the downloading process. The only catch is, after it\nwas installed, it searched your computer for other copyrighted files and\nreported back.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/04/2212213\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://tech.blorge.com/Structure:%20/2007/07/04/mpaas-media-defender-sets-up-fake-site-to-catch-pirates/\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
