I downloaded the \ngnome desktop, and at the gdm beep I type in my username and password, \nand I can hear the desktop load by the noise of the hd, but after that, \nI don't have keyboard control.  I know grml ships with fluxbox, and \ndidn't have keyboard control after logging in using that either... what \ndo I do to get keyboard control so I can run something in x?  Sorry if \nthis was the wrong place to post this...\nThanks much\nCheereo!\n\n-- \nEmail services by FreedomBox.
