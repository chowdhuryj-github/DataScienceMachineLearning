That is contempt prior to investigation.\n\nThose who haven't loved somebody else, more than they love themselves haven't even begun to live\n\nIt is the growling man who lives a dog's life.\n\nA feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain, and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain.\n\nIt is not enough to give the customer excellent service. You must subtly make him aware of the great service he is getting.\n\nGray hair is God's graffiti.\n\nFriendship makes prosperity brighter, while it lightens adversity by sharing its grieves and anxieties.\n\nThe divine egoism hat is genius.\n\nWhen a woman dresses up for an occasion, the man should become the black velvet pillow for the jewel.\n\nAll great men are gifted with intuition. They know without reasoning or analysis, what they need to know.\n\nMen must live and create. Live to the point of tears.\n\nAll literature is gossip.\n\nHappiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons: we must fight in order to conquer it.\n\n\n"}
