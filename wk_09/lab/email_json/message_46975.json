Time to Reboot", "body": "\n\nTrade Talk Weekly Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2007\n\u201cReboot Your System\u201d\nYou may be thinking that due to this little \u201cvacation\u201d from stocks we\u2019ve been taking at Trending123, you can exist on auto-pilot.\n\nWell I don\u2019t recommend it.\nWhen you aren\u2019t trading stocks, you should actively be trying to better yourself as an investor.\u00a0  That way when it comes time to buy stocks, you are amply prepared and confident in your trades.\nOtherwise it\u2019s kind of like when you were a kid coming off of summer break.\u00a0  School work is familiar but it takes you awhile to remember the process and fully be back in the swing of things.\nAnd when it comes to investing, the further you get behind, the less profits you will end up making, while those that have kept their \u201cgame face\u201d on will whiz right past you \u2014 collecting their profits (and yours!) along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of 3\nRemember \u2014 there are 3 indicators that we use to identify where the market or a particular stock is headed.\u00a0  All three are key to understanding what is happening and even more important, what will happen.\nLet\u2019s review them now.\nAroon:\nHow do you tell that a new trend in a certain stock or index has begun?\u00a0  Look no further than the Aroon indicator.\nThe Aroon system uses two lines to plot market trends: an \u201cAroon up\u201d line and an \u201cAroon down\u201d line.\u00a0  The Aroon-up line measures how long it has been since the highest closing price, and the Aroon-down line measures how long it\u2019s been since the lowest closing price.\u00a0  When the Aroon-up line is going up and crosses the Aroon-down line as it is going down, that\u2019s a good indication that the trend is becoming bullish.\u00a0  When the opposite happens\u2014that is, the Aroon-down line is going up and crosses the Aroon-up line as it goes down\u2014that may mean the trend is becoming bearish.\nPPO:\nPPO stands for percentage price oscillator.\u00a0  The PPO expresses the difference between a shorter-term moving average and a longer-term moving average as a percentage.\u00a0  For instance, a PPO of +5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% higher than the longer-term moving average.\u00a0  A PPO of -5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% lower than the longer-term moving average.\nBecause it\u2019s expressed as a percentage instead of as an absolute value, the PPO is very reliable.\u00a0  And that\u2019s why we can use it to help identify trend reversals: When the PPO rises above zero, it\u2019s bullish, and when it falls below zero, it\u2019s bearish.\nWilliams %Range:\nLarry Williams, its developer, used a scale of 0% to 100% to show the relationship of the current closing price relative to the range of prices from the highest to the lowest over a certain period of time.\u00a0  As the closing price approaches the high, the Williams %R will approach 0%.\u00a0  And as the closing price approaches the low, the Williams %R will approach 100%.\nThe Williams %R gives us an easy-to-read signal for when the trend might be turning bullish or bearish.\u00a0  If the Williams %R rises above the 50% line, it\u2019s bullish.\u00a0  If it falls below the 50% line, it\u2019s bearish.\nNow you\u2019ve got three tools that together allow you to identify what I call 1-2-3 bullish and bearish trend reversals.\u00a0  And as Trending123 subscribers have seen again and again, that\u2019s where the best profits are.\n\n\n\n\nA Refresher Course\nLet me remind you what pattern we are in right now and why it can drive us insane.\nIt\u2019s called the RST, or Reverse Symmetrical Triangle.\u00a0  Or some of you may know it under my nickname for it: the Nut Hut.\nI call it this because it can drive any investor nuts!\nThe pattern looks like this:\n\nAnd as you can see, it creates a \u201cmegaphone\u201d formation.\u00a0  This is considered a bearish signal, which indicates that indicating that the current uptrend may reverse to form a new downtrend.\nThat is where we\u2019re at.\u00a0  That is where we have been for several weeks now.\nAnd though it seems as though we will continue a never-ending ride upwards \u2014 don\u2019t let the talking heads fool you \u2014 this pattern is DESTINED to come down.\nI wish I could pinpoint when it will begin its descent.\u00a0  I wish I could prove this to all of you non-believers.\u00a0  But I can\u2019t.\nI can only remind you that these charts that have been used for over a century, have been followed for a reason: THEY WORK.\u00a0  And they don\u2019t lie!\nContinue your education today \u2014 sign-up for Trending123 at a reduced price now!\nAs I said, there\u2019s no way to tell you exactly when the market will tip over and barrel down but when it does come, I\u2019ll be right there,leading the charge!\u00a0  Leading you and my Trending123 subscribers towards the stocks that you can count on for profits\u2014correction be darned!\nYou\u2019ve been forewarned.\u00a0  Now take the next sensible step \u2014 arm yourself with knowledge!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\nP.S. Each pattern has a varying degree of likelihood that it will play out the way the technician thinks it will.\u00a0  The RST has a 98% probability of unfolding the way I say it will.\u00a0  98%!\u00a0  When was the last time you saw odds like that?\u00a0  Join me at Trending123 and let\u2019s get ready to profit together.\n\n\n\n\n\nMANAGE YOUR INVESTORPLACE ACCOUNT:\nWe hope this timely investing advice is valuable to you.\u00a0  Please tell us if your email has changed by visiting here: http://investorplace.com/ipi/e/\nIf you would rather not receive actionable investing advice from InvestorPlace advisors, you can let us know by visiting \nhttp://www.investorplace.com/u/?p=8FP165-1&e=iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca\nWe will honor your request within 7-10 days.\nACP Phillips Investment Resources, LLC,2420A Gehman LaneLancaster, PA 17602\nCopyright \u00a9 2007 ACP Phillips Investment Resources, LLC.\nAll rights reserved.\n06/12/2007 8:04PM\n\nThank you for subscribing to InvestorPlace.com.\u00a0  Please note that we cannot be liable for any missed bulletins caused by overzealous spam filters.\u00a0  To ensure that you continue to receive this valuable part of your service please take a moment to add (JohnLansing@InvestorPlace.com) to your address book.\u00a0  Click here for instructions:\nhttp://www.investorplace.com/whitelist.php?eml=JohnLansing@InvestorPlace.com\n\nee==8FP165\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
