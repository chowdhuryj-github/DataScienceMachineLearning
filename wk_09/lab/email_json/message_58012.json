The Slashdot community [1]discussed\nthe issue when the case was argued back in March. The ruling means that\nanti-competitive complaints based on price-fixing will have to be argued\ncase-by-case and will be harder to prove. Discounts and discounters in\nall venues may be under pressure, with [2]internet sales possibly the\nhardest hit. \"Importantly, this case points a dagger at the heart of the\nmost consumer-friendly aspects of the Internet. The Internet has shifted\npower to the consumer in two ways. First, it allows consumers to search\nfor and gather information in a cost-effective, efficient manner. Second,\nit provides a low-cost means of retailing, making it easy for discounters\nto offer products to the public. This combination squeezes excess profits\nand inefficiencies out of product prices. Retail price maintenance seeks\nto short circuit this extremely consumer friendly process. By setting\nminimum prices, manufacturers can build in excess margins for themselves\nand for their favored retailers -- prices that consumers have no choice\nbut to pay.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/28/1542200\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/business/28cnd-bizcourt.html?ex=1340769600&en=0b4c106d96a846ae&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\n    1. http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/26/221217&tid=123\n    2. http://www.acsblog.org/guest-bloggers-guest-blogger-supreme-court-preview-resale-price-maintenance.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| People Trust Yahoo! and Google For the Brands                      |\n|   from the weighty-logos dept.                                     |\n|   posted by Zonk on Thursday June 28, @17:26 (Google)              |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/28/1938237              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]amigoro writes \"Here's an interesting experiment: Copy Google results\npages from four different e-commerce queries.

The site\nspeculates that, perhaps, one of the reasons it was finally defeated was\na measure intended to [0]expand the use of Real ID cards. If passed, the\nbill would have effectively turned the Real ID system into a National ID\ncard. \"The American Civil Liberties Union, another longtime foe of Real\nID, said the Real ID requirements were a 'poison pill that derailed this\nbill, and any future legislation should be written knowing the American\npeople won't swallow it.' Another section of the immigration bill would\nhave given $1.5 billion to state officials to pay for Real ID compliance.\nEven if the immigration bill is goes nowhere, however, the Real ID Act is\nstill in effect. It says, starting on May 11, 2008, Americans will need a\nfederally-approved ID card to travel on an airplane, open a bank account,\ncollect Social Security payments or take advantage of nearly any\ngovernment service.\" As we've discussed before, [1]several states have\nrebelled against the implementation of Real ID.\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://politics.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/28/2014220\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://news.com.com/2100-7348_3-6193916.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news\n    1. http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/12/148203&tid=158\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Mars Rover Ready for Risky Descent into Crater                     |\n|   from the go-opportunity-do-your-best dept.                       |\n|   posted by Zonk on Thursday June 28, @19:26 (Mars)                |\n|   http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/28/2019245      |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]Riding with Robots writes \"After months of scoping out the terrain,\nthe robotic geologist [1]Opportunity is ready to drive down into Victoria\nCrater on the Meridiani Plains of Mars.
