Yet this strategy will force Abbott to justify its criminal decisions,\nwhich are depriving PLWAs in Tha\u00efland of the company\\u2019s new drugs,\neffectively sentencing them to death.\n\nThe True Crime: Abbott\\u2019s policy\n\nLast December, Tha\u00efland issued compulsory licenses on several drugs, one of\nthem patented by Abbott. By licensing particular drugs, the Thai government\ncan produce or import less expensive, generic copies of the medicines,\nallowing the Thai health system to vastly increase the number of patients\nit treats.\n\nEven though the Thai government\\u2019s decision explicitly respects\ninternational agreements on intellectual property, Abbott decided to\nretaliate in a brand new way: by refusing to register its new\ndrugs-including the heat-stable Kaletra, a second line drug, needed by\nPLWAs in the case of therapeutic failure-in Thailand. Abott is effectively\nsentencing Thai AIDS patients to death.\n\nNo Possible Appeal\n\nAbbott\\u2019s decision went against international agreements on intellectual\nproperty (TRIPS) signed by the government members of the WTO. But the very\nsame agreements don\\u2019t provide an appeal process to the WTO in the case that\na private industrial group decides to ignore them. Only governments are\naccountable to the WTO. Though illegitimate and criminal, Abbott\\u2019s decision\nis not legally questionable.\n\nThe WHO and, for instance, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,\nsupported the Thai government\\u2019s decision. Numerous doctors and researchers\ndenounced Abbott\\u2019s retaliation and called for a boycott of the company\\u2019s\nproducts, a very rare act by health workers. Among the shareholders, a\nstrong minority urged the company\\u2019s leaders to step back and to withdraw\ntheir criminal decision. Without any result.\n\nPublic Challenge, the Last Weapon Abbott Wants to Deprive us of.\nTo defend their lives, the only option for PLWAs was to publicly challenge\nthe company. On April 26, the day before the General Assembly of Abbott\\u2019s\nshareholders, a network of Thai PLWAs called for an international day of\naction, supported by NGOs around the world.\n\nAct Up-Paris called upon activists all over the world to participate in a\nnetstrike. Hundreds, even thousands of people in France, Thailand, the U.S.\nand elsewhere, repeatedly visited Abbott\\u2019s website in order to force a\nslowing down of its servers.\n\nThree weeks later, Abbott filed a complaint against Act Up-Paris. The\nlaboratory wants us to be condemned for \\u201cservice denial.\\u201d Should this be\naccepted by the court, we could be sentenced to very high penalties. The\nfine could reach $50,000, not including liabilities, a communique release\nof the verdict (paid communication) and legal expenses. These expenses\nwould be incredibly damaging to our organization and are a drop in the\nbucket compared to Abbott\\u2019s profits. This legal action is clearly an\nattempt by the laboratory to silence Act Up-Paris.\n\nBringing Abbott\\u2019s suit rather than Act Up\\u2019s\n\nThe legal article Abbott is using against Act Up-Paris stipulates that it\nis forbidden to limit the access to a website, unless the defendant acted\nunder a \\u201clegitimate motive\\u201d. Is defending patients\\u2019 lives against profit\nillegitimate? The call for a boycott issued by Thai patients, public\ndeclarations made by the WHO and officials in the French government, as\nwell as political actions around the world supports the legitimacy of our\nmotive.\n\nBy suing us, Abbott will have to prove that the lives of thousands of Thai\npeople is not legitimate enough a motive to criticize publicly a medicine\ncompany. The lawsuit the laboratory is bringing against us, patients, will\nreveal to the world the very obscenity of Abbott\\u2019s actions in Thailand.\n\nWe request from Abbott\\u2019s leaders to:\n-   Stop threatening countries which are doing nothing more than resorting\nto their rights, in agreement/compliance with international treaties.\n-   Withdraw their decision to put to death thousands of HIV+ people in\nThailand.\n-   Take back their complaint against Act Up-Paris.\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
