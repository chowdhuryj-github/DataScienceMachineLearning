I installed Hmisc from this list, and when I \n  issued the library(Hmisc) command, it loaded into memory \ncorrectly.\n\nI then copied the Design 1.1-1.zip file from the \nhttp://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/Harrell/library/r/ site and used \nthe Install Packages from Local Zip file command.\n\nI received no error messages and a visual inspection of the \nR\\library directory shows Design has been installed.\n\nHowever, when I issued the library(Design) command I get the \nfollowing error message:\n\nError in library(Design) : 'Design' is not a valid package \n-- installed < 2.0.0?\n\n\nI also notice, from a visual inspection of the \nR\\library\\Design\\R directory that there is only one file: \ndesign. In other directories, eg. R\\library\\Hmisc\\R there \nare usually 3 files:\nHmisc\nHmisc.rdx\nHmisc.rdb\n\nI am new to R, and a bit lost. I have read the R-admin.pdf \ndocumentation on packages but am still unsure how to proceed \nfrom here.\n\nI would appreciate any advice, and any answers to the \nfollowing questions:\n\n1) is there a reason why Design is not listed in the Install \nPackages list as Hmisc is?\n2) have I done the correct thing by way of manual \ninstallation of Design?\n3) is the absence of 2 other Design files (rdx, rdb) the \nreason for my failed installation?\n4) what should I try now?\n\n\nI am using R.2.5.0 on Windows XP.\n\nKind regards\nIan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
