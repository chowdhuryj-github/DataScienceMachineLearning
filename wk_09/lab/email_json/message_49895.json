Datasets from\nday 2, have all the same columns than datasets from day 1. However in\naddition, there are few columns more in day 2. Thus, using rbind for\nthis, results a error, because the objects are not the same length. \n\nError in paste(nmi[nii == 0L], collapse = \", \") : \n        object \"nii\" not found\nIn addition: Warning message:\nlonger object length\n        is not a multiple of shorter object length in: clabs == nmi \n\n\nWhat I need, is to combine all the six together, and give for example\nNA-value in day 1, for those columns which can only be found in day 2.\nIs this somehow possible?\n\nI have several of these six-datasets groups, and only few of them are\nhaving this problem described above, and I cannot know in advance which.\nWith most of the groups writing\nrbind(data1,data2,data3,data4,data5,data6)\nworks easily, but these few problematic groups need also to be\ncombined... \nAny help greatly appreciated!\n\n-Jouni\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
