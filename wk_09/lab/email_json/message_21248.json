In the moment that me pass to graphic mode (kde) my pc work slowly.  whyyyyyyyy? \n\nI have an Averatec 3250, which has a Via Unichrome card.  The default\nbehavior of xorg is to use the \"via\" driver.  If your xorg.conf file has \na \"Device\" section which says \n\nDriver \"via\"\n\nthen try adding a line\n\n     Option \"DisableIRQ\"\n\nbefore the end of that Device section and see if that helps.\n\nOn my machine the wired ethernet stops working under X without that \noption.  I remember reports that the wireless ethernet also had \nthis problem on some Averatecs. \n\nSelim T.
