Nor do I mind my display being \nfiddled with to any degree, as long as it's no more than my display. \nEver take a look at Google Analytics?  It's incredible just how much \ndata they can get out of a web page.  The only problem is all that data \ncan !only! be used to exploit their customers by prying open their \nwallets and getting at whatever's inside.  I can do without all the \ngrifting.  HTML alone should be enough to get our money.  They certainly \ndon't need to take control of my computer to spam the bejesus out of me. \n  I know what I'm looking for to buy.   I don't like having things \nshoved in my face.  It's rude and just plain wrong, and if they want to \ndo business that way, I'd rather be on the side of caution and shop \nanywhere else.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
