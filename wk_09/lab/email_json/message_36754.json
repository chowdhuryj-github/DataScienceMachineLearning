I ran \nspeakup-expert to try to install testing instead of stable after I booted \ninto speakup-expert and changed debconf to low priority.  I was never \nprompted to choose the version to install.  Another odd thing happend the \ndebian installation tried to remove the kernel I had selected with speakup \nduring installation of the base system.  I told it NO! and then everything \nworked fine.  I then had to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to install testing \nafter installing the base system and selecting a debian mirror.  I installed \neverything else using tasksel and found that none of the development tools \nlike gcc are installed any more.  If I try to install just gcc it wants me \nto install other libs in the subgested packages and other things.  I would \nlike all of this installed as was the case with sarge.  Has anyone else had \nthese problems and if I ever need to reinstall is there a way to fix them? \nOne thing that shane should put on the people.debian.org/~shane site is an \nsources.list file with the people.debian.org/~shane stuff in it so users can \ndownload and murge it with their own so they can just use apt to install and \nupgrade speakup kernels. \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
