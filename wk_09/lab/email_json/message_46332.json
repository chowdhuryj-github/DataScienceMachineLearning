It's an old S-plus dmp file for a\nhierarchical bayes linear model program written by DuMouchel and available\npublicly and freely at:\nftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/bayes-meta/hblm.dmp \nOnly problem is that it cannot be read in R, even using the functions of the\nlibrary foreign to read dmp files. Does anyone know a workaround, maybe\nhints about what parts of the file need to be modified so that it can be\nread. I have read the documentations of the program, it seems a very\ninteresting program, it's a shame that I can't read it. Thanks.\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Reading-old-S-plus-dmp-files-tf3903236.html#a11066203\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
