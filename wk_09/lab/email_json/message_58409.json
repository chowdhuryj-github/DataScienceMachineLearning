Each \"chapter\" was a .tex file until I started\nusing Sweave.\n\nNow each chapter is an .Rnw file. My master LaTeX document has this:\n\n\\include{introduction}\n\\include{epidemiology}\n\\include{report}\n\nLatex will look for introduction.tex, epidemiology.tex and report.tex.\nI can get LaTeX to only process the introduction by using \\includeonly\n\nOf course, the .tex files are generated from Rnw files via a Makefile.\nThis makefile will only re-generate tex files from Rnw files if the\nRnw file is updated (unless you  give it different rules).\n\nSee post: http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/06/11/4891.html\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMark\n\nOn 29/06/07, Dietrich Trenkler  wrote:\n> Dear HelpeRs,\n>\n> I'm very fond of Sweave and I use it as often as possible.
