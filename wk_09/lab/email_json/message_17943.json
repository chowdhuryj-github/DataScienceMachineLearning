In S-Plus you can \nuse its Dialog function to automatically create a GUI for getting \npredicted values from a series of fitted models.  We will be working on \nan R version but it will publish the model to a web server.\n\nFrank\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
