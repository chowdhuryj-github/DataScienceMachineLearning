After all, grml supports software speech. That means the next step \nis probably to install the rest of the software speech components. There are \nexcellent instructions on getting software speech working on the  speechd-up \nweb site.  See the following page:\n\nhttp://www.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd-up/speechd-up_1.html\n\nI like that page because it explains how to make sure that each step is \nworking before moving on the the next. A lot of authors could learn from \nthat.  I believe the guy who wrote that page is on this list.
