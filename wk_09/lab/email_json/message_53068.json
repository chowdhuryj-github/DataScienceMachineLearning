I have a good idea of how to go about doing it, but don't want to end up with a system that won't talk from boot when I need to try it.  What I was thinking is that since a symbolic link can cross filesystems, I could temporarily change /usr/src/linux to point to the directory of my LFS kernel unpacking.\n    I could then do a CVS checkout--using my existing Linux system, of course, since LFS doesn't come with CVS.  I'd then just change the symlink.\n    Would this work?  \nThanks muchly,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
