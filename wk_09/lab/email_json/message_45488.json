What if the download site goes away after, say, 30\nmonths and only then someone makes a request because he was unable to\ndownload it from the net?\n\nIt you haven't wasted any thought on archiving the sources, you have a  \nreason to be worried then.\n\nClaus\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
