Alas. Although it's most likely to work with pure Perl\nmodules, and least likely to work with anything compiled.\n\nIf you really need to do this, the only practical way I know of is to\nset up an identical box (the \"staging\" machine) that you can really\ninstall and test on. When you have something working on the staging\nmachine, you can copy that to the production system that lacks a\ncompiler. If it doesn't work when it gets there, either you didn't get\nit all there properly, or the two boxes aren't really all that\nidentical, so you get to try again until you get it right. Or until\nyou get a compiler on the box, as nature intended.\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
