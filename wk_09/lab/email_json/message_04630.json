Why do you\nwant to know if the data is normal?\n\nA couple of issues, with very large datasets you have power to detect\nvery minor deviations from normality, and since no real dataset that\nwill be analyzed is truly normal, this will generally give you a\nsignificant result.\n\nOn the other hand, with really large datasets the central limit theorem\ncomes into play and for common analyses (regression, t-tests, ...) you\nreally don't care if the population is normally distributed or not.\n\nThe good rule of thumb is to do a qq-plot and ask, is this normal\nenough?  Rather than depending on formal tests of hypothesis.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
