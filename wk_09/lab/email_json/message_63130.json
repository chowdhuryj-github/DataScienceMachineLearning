I wouldn't say they are conflicting, or few, heres where I look\nfor thinkpad info, or any linux on laptop information.  I happened\nupon this link years ago and it has saved me weeks of time:\nhttp://www.linux-laptop.net\nif you forget the url, just remember to google for \"linux on laptop\",\nand it is almost always the first link.  Then, you get to the thinkpad\nspecific area and find there are long lists.  There is also a lenovo\nlist now, and  I see there is a guy with a t60 which has the intel\ngraphics and a sata hdd, and his howto documents the debian install\nusing etch.  A lot of these folks are not exactly gurus, so they dont\nalways have every piece of hardware configured and/or every cool thing\nactually working say apmd and hibernation ... but this does not\nmatter, the almost always have enough info on the specific hardware to\nget you going.  \n\nI have not tried your specific (unknown) laptop install via debian ,\nbut  I would recommend trying the new stable, as a netinst.iso is only\na couple hundred megs or so and there was a major update to debian\nback in april.\n\nDave\n\n-- \nGNU -- It's Freedom baby, yeah!\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
