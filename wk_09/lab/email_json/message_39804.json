That's a u-turn! shouted Labour.\n\n\nThe Tories say it's existing policy - so who's right? \n\n\nThe Conservative's answer to grammar schools and aiding social mobility are city academies.\n\n\nBut we have evidence tonight that some academies are selecting by the back door and risk \"increasing social segregation\".\n\n\nBUSH AND CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\nPresident Bush has unveiled his strategy on climate change ahead of next week's G8 summit. Tony Blair says \"it's a big step forward\".\n\n\nWe'll be assessing just how big it really is.\n\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\n\nWe have a powerful film from Alastair Leithead on the often forgotten story of civilian casualties in Afghanistan.\n\n\nMADELEINE McCANN\n\n\nIt's four weeks since Madeleine went missing in Portugal.
