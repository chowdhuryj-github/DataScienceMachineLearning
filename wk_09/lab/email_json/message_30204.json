Take the above\nsnippet and consider just changing the variable from non-specific to\nproblem domain, eg $key to $account.  It makes it clearer.\n\nforeach my $account (sort keys xyz) {\n\nLook to the code itself first, use real names and spell them in full.  I\nhave a production system where prefix is shortened to pfx, pref, prefx.\nIt is a nightmare to maintain.\n\nUse paragraphing,  keep lines of code that go together with a blank line\nabove and below.\n\n   something account related;\n   \n   something customer related;\n   something else customer related;\n\n   work out totals for the report;\n\nGenerally clearer code is more important than clearer comments.\n\nCoding is a craft.  Simple to learn the basics, years of mastery to get\nit right.\n\nKen\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
