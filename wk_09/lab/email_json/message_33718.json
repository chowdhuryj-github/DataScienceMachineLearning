(Why *anyone* would ever use anything other than Linux, except\nunder duress as I am, totally escapes me, but that's another story.)\n\nFortunately much of the Mac OSX is actually Unix, so a civilized person can\nmanage to carry on ... But there are some things.  (Like this  mailer ... But that's another story.)\n\nWhen I ``open'' R using the icon on the ``dock'' several things are\nunsatisfactory; like I can't clear the screen using system(\"clear\"), nor can\nI use vi syntax in command line editing.  When I start R from the command\nline (as a civilized person would do) these unsatisfactory circumstances go\naway, but then a new one rears its ugly head:  I can't plot!!!  If I try a\nplot without explicitly opening a plotting device, a postscript device with\nfile name ``Rplots.ps'' is silently opened.  If I try opening a device with\nquartz() to get an on-screen plot, I get a warning message\n\nquartz() device interactivity reduced without an event loop manager in:\nquartz()\n\nAnd a little coloured wheel spins round and round and the quartz() window\nthat opens hides underneath the terminal window and appears to be frozen to\nthe spot.\n\nApparently ``it'' wants .Platform$GUI to be equal to \"AQUA\", but it is\n(under the circumstances) \"X11\".\n\nTrying to open a device using x11() simply results in an error.\n\nIs there any way to get a working on-screen graphics window under these\ncircumstances?\n\nI am very much hand-cuffed by the officious ITS policies here as to what\nI can install on my Mac.  (Effectively, nothing.)\n\n                                ``cheers'' (Hah!),\n\n                                        Rolf Turner\n                                        r.turner@auckland.ac.nz\n\n\n######################################################################\nAttention: \nThis e-mail message is privileged and confidential.
