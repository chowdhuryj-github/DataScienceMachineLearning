Adding the OpenSSL exception to my license makes \nmy code incompatible with the non-modified GPL, and hence I was violating the \nlicense on those 3rd party files (copyrighted by FSF, ATT, Sun, and a few \nothers ...). \n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
