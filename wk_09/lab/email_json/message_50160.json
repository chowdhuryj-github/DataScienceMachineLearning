I'd do it myself, but I'm not a programmer.\n\nYou can still install gentoo you just need to use one of the previous\nlivecds such as2007.1 or even one of the earlier ones such as 2006.1.\nAll a new release with gentoo means is a new set of livecds and more\ncurrent stages. Long as you've got internet access you can still\ndownload a current stage.\n\nAlso nothing says that gentoo won't pick up the  fixed speakup patch and\nput it into 2.6.22 once it's fixed.\n\nI think the main reason it got dropped is because 1, gentoo wants to\nkeep moving forward, this means a more current kernel and it can't do\nthat with patches that break the kernel.\n>\n> I have to reinstall linux because I'm changing machines soon.
