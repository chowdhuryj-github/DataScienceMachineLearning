I have\ndownloaded kernel 2.6.21.3 and installed speakup using the checkout\nscript.  I also installed kernel-package as it says in the debian\ninstallation guide.  In order to get a kernel packaged with all modules\nand the initrd image created either if the kernel is installed or me\ncreate it before or better yet not needing an initrd at all what is the\nbest process to follow?  I would prefer not needing an initrd image.  Any\nhelp would be great!\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
