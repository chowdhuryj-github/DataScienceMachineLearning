I don't think the server used by the library currently is \nanything more than a placeholder.  There hasn't been much discussion \nabout what a server might look like, though of course you are always \nwelcome to bundle your own server with your activity (and I think that \nwould be the best plan at the moment).\n\n\n-- \nIan Bicking | ianb@colorstudy.com | http://blog.ianbicking.org\n             | Write code, do good | http://topp.openplans.org/careers\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
