Most health activists and groups, including Knowledge Ecology\nInternational, say that Brazil should forget about the negotiations\nwith Merck, and just issue the compulsory license, and then buy the\ndrug from the lowest price suppliers (of acceptable quality). Why?\n\nFirst, no one can really say today what the long term best price will\nbe for this drug. Brazil thought they were getting a good price when\nthey previously negotiated a $580 per year price. When Thailand\nactually did issue a compulsory license, they were able to buy the\ndrug from a Generic supplier for $238 per year.\n\nHow low can prices go? With larger economies of scale, this product\nshould be available for less than $400 per formulated kilo, or less\nthan $90 per year, for the 600 mg per day dose. But his will only\nhappen if several large countries buy from generic suppliers.\nThailand and Brazil together would make a big difference.\n\nSecond, Brazil needs access to generic versions of new fixed dose\ncombinations, like FTC + TDF + EFV, not to mention newer protease\ninhibitors that are co-formulated with ritonavir. Brazil, a member of\nUNITAID, needs to create a patent pool for all patents that are\nrelevant for sustaining treatments for AIDS, and ensure that the pool\nhas access to everything, through compulsory licenses if necessary.\n\nBrazil then should negotiate on the remuneration for patent owners.\nThey should not make the mistake of Thailand, and start the\nnegotiation with a royalty rate that is very low, because the world\nwill see this as evidence that the country will not pay a reasonable\namount. One possibility would be use the 2005 WHO/UNDP remuneration\nguidelines, which I wrote. Another possibility would be to set aside\na fraction of the budget for ARV purchases for a prize fund that\nwould reward developers of new AIDS drugs, in proportion to the\nimpact of the drug on improving health outcomes. This second approach\nwould be the most innovative, and sustainable, in the longer run, in\nour opinion.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nJames Packard Love\nKnowledge Ecology International\nhttp://www.keionline.org\njames.love@keionline.org\nWashington, DC +1.202.332.2670\n\n\"If everyone thinks the same: No one thinks.\" Bill Walton\"\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
