A portfolio starting with $100,000 is now worth $384,095. That\u2019s the average.\n          And many might say that\u2019s a darn good reason to invest with Vanguard.\nBut during that exact same time, investors who took my advice on Vanguard saw their personal pots of gold grow not three but EIGHT TIMES\n            LARGER.\nMy name is Dan Wiener and some say I have the Midas Touch when it comes to Vanguard\u2019s funds. Seems every fund I recommend surges beyond\n        expectations. Lucky? Not really. I\u2019ve been picking the perfect Vanguard funds for nearly 20 years and I\u2019m doing it again right now!\n\n\n\u201cYour Vanguard profits will surge 136% beyond your expectations this year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Wiener, the man with the Midas Touch for Vanguard funds,\n                    wants you to get rich, too.\n\n\nThis is not a prediction. \n              IT\u2019S A PROMISE!\nBut if you\u2019re holding Vanguard\u2019s most popular funds, your profit surge won\u2019t happen. This Briefing tells you why you\u2019re\n              better off selling those funds today, and how this year, you can more than double your profits with a fraction of the risk you\u2019re taking\n              now.\n\n\nIt might seem I\u2019m bragging a bit. But I\u2019m just giving the facts. The same $100,000 that the average Vanguard investor grew to $384,095\n        pales compared to the $905,530 that investors who followed my advice would have.\nWe (my subscribers and I) did it all with Vanguard funds. Yes, a profit of $805,530. That\u2019s $521,435 more profit than Vanguard\u2019s\n        average investor. Staggering. And sad, because the facts show that the average Vanguard investor, and you might be among them, is missing out on\n        $32,589.69 each year in profits. \nEvery year you stay with Vanguard\u2019s most popular funds is costing you plenty, my friend. But I\u2019m not writing to you today to tell\n        a sad tale. \nI\u2019m going to lift your Vanguard profits dramatically. And at the same time, I\u2019m going to cut your risks, slash your unnecessary investment\n        costs and tell you how to get more out of your Vanguard funds. \nHow? Well, I\u2019m about to reveal 19 Vanguard secrets that will put you on the right path. But first, let me get some necessary business out\n        of the way. \nTurn 25\u00a2 into $89 on a Daily Basis!\nThat extra $32,589.69 Vanguard profit I deliver each year (about $89 a day in extra profits) to members can be yours for about 25\u00a2 a\n        day. That\u2019s the cost of my investment advisory service.\nThink of what this could mean to you. When every 25\u00a2 you spend turns into $89\u2014day after day, year after year\u2014your life changes. \n\n\nHow Dan\u2019s Vanguard \n            Midas Touch \n            Has Made His \n            Subscribers Rich \n\n\n\u00a0\nAverage\n                    Vanguard\n                    Investor\nDan\u2019s\n                    Growth Model\n                    Portfolio\n\n\nStarting Value\n$100,000 \n$100,000 \n\n\n1991\n$115,550 \n$128,900 \n\n\n1992\n124,147\n136,763\n\n\n1993\n137,480\n159,466\n\n\n1994\n137,164\n159,147\n\n\n1995\n166,792\n200,684\n\n\n1996\n188,591\n233,997\n\n\n1997\n223,235\n288,285\n\n\n1998\n256,207\n356,032\n\n\n1999\n285,774\n485,271\n\n\n2000\n288,631\n584,266\n\n\n2001\n275,845\n546,874\n\n\n2002\n250,053\n449,530\n\n\n2003\n294,138\n593,380\n\n\n2004\n322,346\n685,540\n\n\n2005\n342,331\n764,806\n\n\n2006\n384,095\n905,530\n\n\n% Advantage: 136%\n              Extra Profit: $521,435\n\n\nInstead of taking two-week vacations once a year, you can buy a second home in your favorite part of the world, and still afford to jet away to\n        other spots whenever you want. \nInstead of taking a part-time job to pay for a comfortable retirement, you can buy or start your own business. \nInstead of selling your home and moving into a smaller, cheaper place, you can amass a fortune, live like royalty and still leave a healthy legacy\n        to your children and grandchildren.\nTo achieve this, all you do is make that 25\u00a2-for-$89 trade-off.

It can get you into deep trouble when you\u2019re investing with Vanguard. \nIf you want bigger Vanguard profits, you do NOT have to take on bigger risks. But Vanguard really doesn\u2019t want you to know this. \nThey want you to keep pouring money into their most popular funds, which brings us to the second rule of Vanguard investing: Forget indexing. \n\n\n\nFame Is Not Fortune \n\n\nVanguard became famous for indexing, but index investors do not become as rich as my members do. What\u2019s worse is index investors have no\n        idea how risky those funds can be. And risk is the enemy. Controlling risks is probably one of the top reasons you\u2019re investing in mutual\n        funds. But what you are about to discover will shock you. \nAs I reveal 19 secrets critical to your Vanguard success, you will begin to see how my Midas Touch works. And you will see how Vanguard\u2019s\n        most cautious investors can be the ones taking on the most risks. Find out what they are by clicking here.\n19 Secrets You Must Know Now to\n        Build Wealth Safely at Vanguard\nSince I do not know what kind of investor you are, the following secrets I\u2019m about to expose cover the entire landscape: Indexing, growth\n        investing, Vanguard\u2019s closed funds, sector investing, income investing, annuities, diversification, and secrets covering buying and selling\n        Vanguard funds.\nVANGUARD SECRET #1\n500 Index is not the safest index fund, nor is it the most best-performing index fund, nor is it the best way to invest in\n          large-cap stocks. In fact, during the last bear market investors lost more than $40 billion in this fund.\n500 Index has more risk built into it than Vanguard wants you to know about. Diversified? Risk free? Below-average risk? Think again, my friend.\n\n\n\nCaution: Hidden Risks \n\n\nA whopping 26% of the fund\u2019s assets are tied up in just 10 stocks, and nearly half (49%) of its assets are invested in just three sectors.\n        What\u2019s more, 500 Index took an eternity\u2014six years\u2014to recover from the tech implosion. In fact, investors just barely got back\n        to even in December of 2006. \nVANGUARD SECRET #2\nVanguard has a fund that\u2019s remarkably close to the 500 Index, except it\u2019s safer, performs better, and it\u2019s\n          actively managed!\nIf you want to invest along with the S&P 500, fine. But you\u2019ll be much better off when you do it with a fund that can weed out the dogs\n        that live in index funds. \nVanguard has such a fund, and members of the Fund Family Shareholder Association (or FFSA, the organization I created in 1990 to help investors\n        get richer, faster in their mutual funds) know all about it. This fund holds just 120 stocks. 65% of its assets are in stocks that are included\n        in 500 Index (the best of the 500). The other 35% of its assets are put to work in other areas. And that\u2019s where this fund\u2019s professional\n        management skills prove their worth.\nVANGUARD SECRET #3\nIndex funds, even the best ones, simply don\u2019t compare favorably to Vanguard\u2019s best actively managed funds.\nVanguard has a slew of index funds with growth objectives, the 500 Index among them. And if you\u2019re looking for capital appreciation and\n        you\u2019re indexing to get it, well you\u2019re making a costly mistake, one that traps the average Vanguard investor time and time again and\n        costs them up to 40% in profits year after year.\nPlease don\u2019t lose 40% of your profits this year. Join FFSA today. Do not wait for Vanguard to tell you that indexing is last century\u2019s\n        way to profit safely. They will never reveal this fact to you.\nIndexing is failing now. From 2000 to 2005, Vanguard\u2019s index funds were down a collective 13.3%. But during that same five-year time frame,\n        the funds I recommended to FFSA members were up 17.9%\u2014with 13% less risk!\n\n\n\n$50,000 Grows To $40,000 \n\n\nHad you been with us as a member since I created our exclusive Growth Model Portfolio (one of four portfolios I construct exclusively for members),\n        a $50,000 investment on your part would now be worth over $400,000. That\u2019s an average annual return of 14.8%\u2014for 16 years.\nVANGUARD SECRET #4\nMost growth investors buying managed funds are too heavily invested in U.S. stocks.\nThe real action these days is outside the U.S. Sure, our economy is growing, but our growth rate (expect a slower growth rate this year) is nothing\n        like what\u2019s happening overseas. And Vanguard is right there, ready to let you in on all the action. \n\n\n\nHottest Fund \n\n\nAfter posting gains of 44.5% in 2003 and 20.1% in 2004, Vanguard closed their only truly global stock fund. But in August of 2005, it re-opened\n        and kept a standard low minimum ($3,000) to get in. What\u2019s more, and this may shock you, this actively-managed global fund has about half the\n        risk of 500 Index. \nOnce you become a member of FFSA and start receiving our private advisory, you\u2019ll see that this fund plays a major role in our Growth Model\n        portfolio. \nAs I said, this global fund is now open once again to new investors. But who knows? It could slam its doors shut again without notice at any moment.\n        So please, join us today.\nSpeaking of closed funds. If you follow Vanguard at all, no doubt you\u2019ve been frustrated to find that many of the best funds are closed. \nTake, for example, the 10-year returns enjoyed by owners of Health Care: +355.5%. Or Capital Opportunity: +324.6%. Funds like these can set you\n        up for life! In fact, both of these funds paid my kids\u2019 college tuitions. But both of them are now closed to new investors.\nIn all, seven of Vanguard\u2019s funds are closed. And many of them are funds you\u2019d be smart to own. No secret there. The big family secret\n        is that even if you don\u2019t own them now, you can still get in!\nVANGUARD SECRET #5\nVanguard has a form you can pick off their website that enables you to get into their closed funds. \nFFSA members know this secret, of course. And knowing it has enabled many of them to reap tremendous rewards that otherwise would have been shut\n        off to them. By joining us, you can unlock many doors that are now closed to you. \nVANGUARD SECRET #6\nVanguard\u2019s closed funds have clones that often present even better investment opportunities.\nCapital Opportunity\u2019s kissing cousin is PRIMECAP, which sorry to say, is also closed. But PRIMECAP Core is wide open. It\u2019s a healthy\n        hybrid of the two. Less than two years old, PRIMECAP Core is already piling up the profits like crazy (up more than 12% in each of its first two\n        years). \n\n\n\nBetter Than The Closed Funds \n\n\nWhat about Health Care? Does it have a clone? Yes! But many investors (non-members of FFSA, that is) fall into a trap seeking a Health Care clone.\n        The unknowing assume that Vanguard\u2019s Health Care Index Fund is a good alternative. But it is not!\nFirst off, Health Care Index has a minimum initial investment of $100,000. With such a steep entry fee, it\u2019s all but closed to most investors\n        anyway. Second, it both underperforms Vanguard\u2019s managed Health Care fund and has a higher risk as well. Not a good combo.\nVANGUARD SECRET #7\nThe manager of Vanguard\u2019s Health Care fund, Ed Owens, runs a health care fund outside of Vanguard that\u2019s wide\n          open to you!\nSame fund manager. Same fund objectives. Different fund family. The fact that the best alternative to Vanguard\u2019s closed Health Care fund\n        is not a Vanguard fund doesn\u2019t stop me from recommending it to FFSA members, especially when there\u2019s no stopping the demands for health\n        care.\nMore than 25% of our 300 million population (78 million of us!) are just now entering the phase of their lives when health care becomes the most\n        important aspect of their lives.\n\n\n\nBest Investment Trend \n\n\nIf you can only invest in one trend, health care should be it! And if you can\u2019t get into Vanguard\u2019s Health Care, don\u2019t worry.\n        I\u2019ll tell you all about Ed Owens\u2019 other managed health care fund (you can bet the ranch Vanguard won\u2019t tell you about it) as\n        soon as you join FFSA.\nAnother way to capture the growth of America\u2019s 78-million strong baby boom generation is to buy shares of ETFs that are comparable to the\n        Health Care fund. You\u2019ll learn which ETF to buy when your FFSA Welcome Package arrives.\n\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d\n\u201cYour membership price has already returned an improved performance. Thanks!\u201d\n\u2014R.W., Kernersville, NC\n\u201c...a lot more money...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a comfort to have a talented adviser helping me make fund picks. I\u2019ve come to trust Dan\n              and, so far, feel he has made a lot more money for me than I could have on my own.\u201d\n\u2014R.S., West Dover, VT\n\u201cMy future is \n              brighter now\u201d\n\u201cI used to only buy Vanguard\u2019s most popular funds. I always went with the biggest, looking for safety.\n              But now, with Dan Wiener\u2019s help, I\u2019m seeing much better returns from funds I never considered before. My future is brighter now,\n              thanks to Dan.\u201d\n\u2014C.H., Boston, MA\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a Vanguard \n              investor \n            for years, but...\n\u201cI was so wrapped up in trading stocks on my online account that I just about lost sight of Vanguard. When\n              it came to time pay my daughter\u2019s college tuition, I saw that my Vanguard funds were making more money than I was trading stocks on\n              my own\u2014and I trade with advice offered by several stock-picking gurus! As luck would have it, I received an invitation to join FFSA\n              on the same day I checked my Vanguard funds. FFSA promised me even greater Vanguard profits, so I joined. And FFSA kept every promise, big\n              time! Now my Vanguard investments are doing even better than before. I know now that Vanguard is where every nickel of serious money belongs\u2014especially\n              now that I have FFSA guiding me to the best Vanguard has to offer.\u201d\n\u2014W.H., Philadelphia, PA\n\n\nVANGUARD SECRET #8\nOnly two of Vanguard\u2019s ten $100,000 minimum sector funds produced double-digit returns. One actually lost money.\nIf you had $25,000 to pony up and ice water galloping through your veins, you could have gotten into Vanguard\u2019s Energy fund and seen big\n        payoffs over the last several years. \nA smaller, albeit still chunky initial investment of $10,000, would have given you entry to Vanguard Precious Metals & Mining. It paid off\n        even better than the $25,000 minimum Energy.\nWhile it\u2019s not quite true that the higher the minimum initial investment the lower the returns, it\u2019s pretty darn close to being true. \nThe only sector fund that requires the standard $3,000 initial investment, REIT Index, outperformed 80% of the highest-priced funds. \nREIT Index is all about real estate. And you know what\u2019s been happening in that sector lately. It\u2019s cooling fast. So be careful chasing\n        after profits here.\n\n\n\nSpecial Caution \n\n\nCaution should also be exercised before you go chasing after Energy and Precious Metals. Those two sector funds have been Vanguard\u2019s biggest\n        profit generators lately. But what goes up must come down. And the volatility of these two sector funds is so fierce that they represent not investments\n        but speculation.\nVANGUARD SECRET #9\nBuy a high-flying sector fund at the wrong time and you can see two-thirds of your money disappear.\nSector funds are tempting. But buying a sector fund is actually a form of market timing, which individual investors never seem to master. But\n        when you\u2019re a member of FFSA, you suddenly have the world\u2019s best portfolio managers, and my track record of success, on your side.\n        I make sure of it!\nWithout an expert guiding you, sector fund investing can be more akin to speculating, which is a nice word for gambling. If you want to speculate,\n        be ready to say goodbye to a large chunk of your money. And if you\u2019re ready to lose a bundle speculating, why not skip mutual funds altogether,\n        buy a few penny stocks and hope for the best? \nBut if you want to be smart and limit your risks, make long-term investments that make real money for you safely and on a consistent basis, join\n        FFSA. As a member, you\u2019ll have complete access to the Growth Model portfolio I\u2019ve put together for FFSA members. Join today. \n\n\n\nBest Way To Cut Risk \n\n\nAs you\u2019ll see when your FFSA Membership Package arrives, you don\u2019t have to throw caution to the wind to grab the big paydays. Some\n        of the least-risky funds are some of the best producing!\nOne more thing. As I\u2019ve mentioned above, many of Vanguard\u2019s sector funds carry a high entry price, calling for a minimum investment\n        of $100,000. And most of those just aren\u2019t worth the price of admission. Find out what stocks those are by clicking here.\nVANGUARD SECRET #10\nFunds that mandate initial investments of $100,000 can be yours for much less when you buy their equivalent ETFs.\nExchange Traded Funds are hot, which is to say they are highly popular, but not necessarily profitable for the investor who doesn\u2019t know\n        how to use them properly. You\u2019ll find out which ones are worth the brokerage commissions in your FFSA Welcome Package.\nVANGUARD SECRET #11\nYou can actually lose money in a \u201csafe\u201d fund designed to generate income.\nIf you invest with Vanguard for income, you have no room for risk. Yet, many Vanguard income investors have their money in bond funds and Treasuries\n        that are more than twice as risky as their benchmark, the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index.\nOk, maybe you don\u2019t expect returns as high as you might get in a growth fund, but you certainly do expect less risk. And you certainly don\u2019t\n        expect to lose money. But many Vanguard income investors do lose money. Take inflation into consideration and even more are losing money in income\n        funds.\nVANGUARD SECRET #12\n\n\n\nBeware Of The \"Name Game Trap\" \n\n\n57% of Vanguard\u2019s taxable income funds are riskier than the industry-standard benchmark. Of the family\u2019s tax-exempt\n          income funds, 64% are more risky.\nBut how would you know this? Vanguard doesn\u2019t tell you. When it comes to helping you pick an income fund, Vanguard actually helps you fall\n        into traps. \nI call it the \u201cName Game Trap.\u201d Vanguard has a lot of funds with \u201cincome\u201d in their names. But my Income Model portfolio\n        constructed for FFSA members includes only one fund that has \u201cincome\u201d in its name, and it only constitutes 10% of our model income\n        portfolio. \nI\u2019ve examined all of Vanguard\u2019s income funds and found most of them aren\u2019t worth your dollars. In our quest to always double\n        the profits of the average Vanguard investor, I\u2019ve found just one that does the job well enough to qualify for my portfolios\u2014and you\n        can get its name when you join FFSA.

Our clear\n        strategy for blending equity growth funds to get a higher return is laid out for you when you become a member. \nVANGUARD SECRET #14\nOne Vanguard annuity has actually performed better than its underlying fund.\n\n\n\nVanguard's #1 Annuity \n\n\nVanguard won\u2019t steer you away from any of their variable annuities, but they should forbid you from buying some of them.\nYou see, Vanguard\u2019s annuity funds are tax-deferred clones of other funds. Buying one for your 401(k) is a costly mistake. Annuities are\n        expensive when compared to the underlying funds they mimic and there is absolutely no reason for you to have an annuity in an account that\u2019s\n        already tax advantaged.\nSince they are more expensive than their underlying funds, annuity returns are almost always subpar. I said \u201calmost.\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s not like the underlying fund, Windsor II, is a dog. It has rewarded investors with returns of 61.9% over the last five years. Still,\n        the annuity fund did even better\u201470.7%.\nThe manager of this annuity is Jim Barrow, one of Vanguard\u2019s all-time best equity fund managers. The underlying fund, Windsor II, is run\n        by a host of different managers. But Mr. Barrow runs this annuity all by himself.\n\n\n\nA Safe 70.7% Return \n\n\nAnd yet, his is not the overall best Vanguard annuity fund. That title belongs to the tax-deferred clone of PRIMECAP. (Unlike PRIMECAP, this annuity\n        fund is not closed to new investors.) \nYour FFSA Welcome Package has all the details on these two top Vanguard annuities, as well as details on all of Vanguard\u2019s best funds. Join\n        today.\nVANGUARD SECRET #15\nMidCap Growth has a remarkably close correlation to SmallCap Growth, which is closely correlated to LargeCap Index.\n\n\n\nAnother Hidden Risk \n\n\nNo matter which type of fund fits your investment objectives the best, you\u2019re looking for the safety of diversification. That\u2019s why\n        you turn to mutual funds, isn\u2019t it?\nBet you didn\u2019t realize that 13 of Vanguard\u2019s growth funds have the exact same top-10 holdings. So, if you own two growth funds, chances\n        are you\u2019re overexposed on those stocks. Overlapping investments, which is the opposite of diversification, is a trap far too many Vanguard\n        investors fall into. \nIn 2005, Vanguard introduced Diversified Equity, to help investors achieve favorable diversification easily. It\u2019s a fund made up of other\n        funds.\nThe core of the fund is Growth & Income, which is just about as close as you can get to 500 Index. \nDiversified Equity also includes Windsor and Windsor II, U.S. Growth and Morgan Growth, Capital Value and MidCap Growth. So yes, Vanguard does\n        reach a degree of diversification with that mix.\n\n\n\nAnother \"Name Game Trap\" \n\n\nBut still, in the end, Diversified Equity isn\u2019t much better than a straight total-market index fund. You simply don\u2019t get the safety\n        you seek from Diversified Equity, no matter what Vanguard\u2019s marketing might say. FFSA members know to avoid this disappointing fund. \nHowever, the Model Portfolios presented and tracked every month in our private advisory, The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, are putting\n        this fund and others to shame on all counts! Diversification and returns! \nVANGUARD SECRET #16\nYou could get hit hard with taxes on gains the fund achieved during the months before you jump in.\n\n\nFFSA MEMBERSHIP IS \n            FOR EVERY KIND OF\n            VANGUARD INVESTOR \nEach of Dan Wiener\u2019s four model portfolios is a collection of the very best Vanguard funds for a variety of investment strategies\n                and preferences. Each issue of Dan\u2019s private advisory, The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, tracks these four model\n                portfolios for you:\n\nGrowth Model\nConservative Growth Model\nIncome Model\nGrowth Index Model\n\n\n\nCan you imagine Vanguard telling you not to sink a large amount of money into any taxable fund late in the year? \nFunds normally pay out capital gains at the end of the year. Why should you pay taxes on gains realized before you got on board? So please, do\n        not buy just prior to a fund\u2019s distribution date. Wait until the beginning of the year, or at least until after distributions are made. The\n        money you\u2019ll save on taxes adds up and goes directly to your bottom line.\nVANGUARD SECRET #17\nYou can save on taxes and penalties by NOT automatically reinvesting your distributions.\nGenerally, automatically reinvesting capital gains distributions is a fine idea, but this practice can lead to a higher tax bill if you\u2019re\n        the kind of investor who rebalances your portfolio from time to time.\nBuying more shares of a fund could conflict with rebalancing decisions that say you should be scaling back a bit. This will only lead you to a\n        bigger tax bite, since you\u2019d have to sell some of your automatically reinvested shares. And if a back-end load is involved, then you could\n        find yourself paying that penalty as well.\nWhat should you do with your capital gains distributions? Have them directly deposited into your money market account. You\u2019ll still pay\n        taxes on your distributions, but now you\u2019ve given yourself the flexibility of moving that extra cash into the funds your rebalancing decisions\n        say need beefing up.\nVANGUARD SECRET #18\nFunds that lose money can still hand you a tax bill.\nObviously, paying taxes and taking a loss is a double whammy you do not want. Yet, many mutual fund investors find themselves in that situation\n        year after year. Believe me, that\u2019s no way to build wealth for your future.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for you to invest in tax efficient funds. FFSA membership will help you do this. As a member, you learn\n        all sorts of ways to make sure nothing comes between you and your profits.\nVANGUARD SECRET #19\nVanguard will accept additional investments in any amount, even less than $1.\nVanguard wants you to believe there\u2019s a $100 minimum on investments you make into existing accounts. Not true. There is no such thing as\n        a minimum additional investment.\n\n\n\nThe Holy Grail for Vanguard Investors\n\n\nInvest as much as you can as often as you can. And during those months you might be a little tight, keep on investing even if you only have a\n        few bucks to put toward your future. It pays! And it pays double when you invest armed with the unique intelligence FFSA membership injects in\n        you. \nVanguard is a huge family with more family secrets than can be revealed here. Join FFSA and all the family secrets will be revealed\n      to you. \nKnowing all the secrets certainly helps, but the bottom line is making sure your money is in the funds that are best for you. And that\u2019s\n        the core advantage of membership.\n\n\nEach Page of This FREE Gift Gives You \n              More Information Than Vanguard Ever Will!\nIn\n                this comprehensive book you\u2019ll find: \n\nComplete, detailed profiles of every Vanguard fund (sample page shown in illustration below). \nDan Wiener\u2019s specific insights on every fund\u2014he tells you to buy, sell, or hold, and why. \nData on all of Vanguard\u2019s fund managers and outside management companies. \nYear-by-year comparative return charts. \nFund comparisons by size, risk and portfolio turnover. \nVanguard\u2019s history, philosophy, services and policies. \nImportant Vanguard phone numbers. \nAnd much, much more!\n\n\nFund Objective \n              States the fund\u2019s primary and secondary objectives, types of securities, and percentage cash positions.

Tells you if the fund has fared better or worse than the market\n              as a whole.\n1996-2006 Performance \n              Shows year-by-year total return, plus income and capital gains distributions, operating expenses, portfolio turnover rate, risk ratings,\n                size in $millions, and price at year\u2019s end (Net Asset Value). Tells you if the fund is efficient, profitable, safe and more.\nRisk Level \n              Shows the Maximum Cumulative Loss (MCL) during the fund\u2019s history, the number of months it took to accumulate that loss (MTL) and the\n              number of months it took to recover (MTR). Tells you the relative risk level of the fund.\nThis one-of-a-kind guide is yours FREE when you join FFSA!\n\n\nWhat Kind of Investor Are You?\nDo you favor large-caps? Do you invest for income? Growth? Do you feel most comfortable with index funds?\nI won\u2019t pass judgment on your investment comfort zones or objectives.

You\u2019ll discover what few Vanguard income investors know, such as the\n                bond fund that\u2019s best for 2007, the only annuity fund you should own, the fund that kicks off more income to you than municipal bond\n                funds and dividend-based funds.
