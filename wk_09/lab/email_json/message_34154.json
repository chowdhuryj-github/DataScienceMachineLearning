However,  \nthat return value is not used (and in fact the method's DBus type  \nsignature does not specify any \"out\" parameter).\n\nIs there a requirement that every activity instance needs to open a  \nseparate top-level X window? If so, could we remove that requirement?\n\nSince activities are full-screen, to the user it should not matter if  \nswitching instances reuses the same X window or switches between  \ndifferent X windows.\n\n- Bert -\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
