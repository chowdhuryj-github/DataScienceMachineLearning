Hi everyone, August marks \n      the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina but at least 86,000 families \n      are still living in those white FEMA trailers along the Gulf Coast. While \n      FEMA may have helped shelter a lot of families, our investigative team has \n      discovered that the trailers may be toxic to the people who call them \n      home. Investigative Correspondent Armen Keteyian will report. \n      Sharyl Attkisson is also reporting from the Gulf Coast. \n      Tonight she'll have an update on New Orleans and the surrounding area - \n      how far has it really come since Katrina? In South Carolina last \n      night, Republican presidential candidates took the stage for their second \n      debate. As our senior political correspondent Jeff Greenfield will \n      report, there were more than a few sparks. He'll have the highlights. \n      In health news, we'll look into the Internet and its growing role \n      as a place to find prescription drugs. But, as Wyatt Andrews will \n      report, much of that buying and selling is done illegally without \n      prescriptions - so much that it is catching the attention of legislators \n      on Capitol Hill. Younger and younger kids are using cell phones - \n      and parents are paying the price as kids ring up big bills for games, \n      ringtones and other electronic accessories. The catch: kids don't need a \n      parent's go-ahead before adding charges their bill. Richard \n      Schlesinger will have the story as well as some solutions. \n      Finally, we've got a story about possible Irish roots popping up \n      in an unlikely spot in American politics. According to members of one \n      little church on the Emerald Isle, records show a potential genealogical \n      connection to the 2008 presidential race. I'll give you a hint - \n      his surname isn't O'Malley or O'Connor, but it does start with an \"O.\" \n      I hope you'll join us, Katie For \n      more information on these stories, please click on the following \n      links: Brits Nix Prince Harry Iraq Tour Click \n      Here GOP Candidates Sharpen Their Attacks Click \n      Here And here's a look at one of the stories we're working \n      on for Thursday's broadcast: Credit card companies are now \n      targeting HIGH SCHOOL KIDS...getting them hooked on PLASTIC.
