If I was to measure e.g. the age distribution of people entering a building on a daily basis, I would naturally observe fluctuations in that distribution. Clearly, small variations would be interpreted as \"sampling noise\" whereas major shifts would indicate sth. more substantial. How would I quantify this ? \nWould a ChiSquare test be an appropriate test for testing overall stationarity ? Or a two-way ANOVA decomposition ?\nAlso, what if wanted to test specific days for significant deviation from my Null model instead of overall ?\nI am familiar with univariate time series change point detection algorithms but am not clear on how to translate these tools to the constrained/multivariate distribution setting.\n\nThanking you!\n\nMarkus\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
