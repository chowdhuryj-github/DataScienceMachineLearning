If it's not a quick one, \n   we can mark this test as TODO for JIT before the release tomorrow.\n\nI'm sorry, but I'm clueless when it comes to JIT.  (As you may have\nguessed.)  It seems that the emit_shift_* routines need to emit code\nthat does what bit_shift_left would do, but I don't know how yet.  If\nTODO-marking is OK for now, then please do so, and I'll work on it ASAP.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob\n\n"}
