I have a\nweb site that allows the user to set the time they would like to\ndownload a file... The program uses the Linux \"at\" command and launches\nanother perl program that does the actual FTP download.  I would like to\npass a parm variable (email address) from the web site, captured in the\nfirst perl program to the second perl program.  Is this possible?\n\n \n\nFirst program uses this line to queue the job \n\n \n\nsystem \"/usr/bin/at $hour:$minute $tod today < /var/www/cgi-bin/images\";\n\n\n \n\nimages is a text file containing the perl program that runs the FTP\ndownload:\n\n \n\nperl /var/www/cgi-bin/get_image_file.pl \n\n \n\n Is there a way to pass a variable from program 1 to program 2?\n\n \n\nThanks for your help!!\n\n \n\nBrian Volk\n\n \n\n           \n\n \n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
