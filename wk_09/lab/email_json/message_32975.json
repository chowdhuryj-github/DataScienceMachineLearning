The message shows\nit assigned an interrupt (IRQ 9) but then says cannot find the \nslot  for index 0 (range 0-0), that could also be related to the \nACPI which among other things dynamically assigns the \ninterrupts. Maybe it is conflicting with the other sound card\nor another PCI device. A few things that you could check:\n\nIf you do lspci command does it show both sound cards?\n\nHave you tried getting each sound card working separately \nbefore trying to get them both working at the same time?\n\nIn the BIOS settings there is configuration for PCI slots,\nyou may be able to do manual setting the PCI slots that \nhave the cards installed rather choosing auto.\n\nTwo other possible BIOS settings you could try are \nturning of the \"PnP Aware OS\" setting and turning off\nthe ACPI setting. If you try these try them one at a time\nto see if they make any difference.\n\nIt would be worthwhile to try to find out what the error\ncode -12 means on the following error message\nEMU10K1X: probe of 0000:00:0f.0 failed with error -12\n\nPerhaps looking at the alsaconf source code would help\ndetermine what triggers the -12 error and what it means,\ndepends on if the code is well documented.\n\nBTW I love your email signature, continuing on with the\nWilliamson quote ... There is nothing enlightened about \nshrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around \nyou. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were \nborn to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. \nIt's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let \nour own light shine, we unconsciously give other people \npermission to do the same. As we are liberated from our \nown fear, our presence automatically liberates others ...\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
