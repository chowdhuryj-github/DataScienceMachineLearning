This clause is not about making the \nGNU Manifesto (or even a copy of the GPL) pop up every time you start an \napplication.

I think it's reasonable for the software they use to tell them \nwhat rights they have to it.\n\n> Especially when I didn't ask to be spammed with that notice.\n> Repeatedly receiving some text has a price paid in my attention span, making\n> me lose time which could be used for just anything else.

You could \nargue that the command could be accidentally invoked, but that's true of \nbuttons in GUIs or mistakenly typing -V instead of -v on a command-line \napp. Just pick a sequence of movements that it's very difficult to do \nwithout meaning it.\n\nGerv\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
