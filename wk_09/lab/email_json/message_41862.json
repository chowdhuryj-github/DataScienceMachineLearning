I don't recall there always \nhaving been an issue but it exists at the moment.\n\nIt should be noted probably that darwin actually has the same issue, \nbut is resolved in the Makefile for 'make test'.  I've looked at the \ndocumentation for FreeBSD's make and I haven't found a way to set an \nenvironmental variable.  Darwin uses gmake which has that option.\n\nOn Jun 3, 2007, at 10:16 PM, chromatic wrote:\n\n> On Thursday 19 April 2007 19:45:29 Ryan Hinton wrote:\n>\n>> Here is my machine info:\n>> FreeBSD 5.3-STABLE i386\n>>\n>> Here is the complete report.\n>\n> Thanks for the report.
