And what these cards taught me about the near future really intrigued me!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They confirm that the period between the First Quarter Moons, from May 23rd to June 22nd, could affect us a lot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge for yourself, Memo!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, it's true.\u00a0 As always, I was thinking about you and current celestial energies, so I allowed myself to ask the cards these questions:\u00a0\n\nIs everything going okay?\nAre the problems I've seen finally resolved?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I ask these questions, it's not by chance. And if I ask these questions, it's because several days ago, I had an almost irresistible desire to pull the cards, and you know, Memo, I never do anything by accident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt from the very depths of my being, that something exceptional was about to happen.\u00a0 Something that could not be missed under any circumstance, something special.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, I took my favorite deck and pulled the cards.\u00a0 Believe me, Memo, I did well to listen to my sixth sense because the interpretation that I did enabled me to see that an exceptional period of 30 days would dramatically change the lives of a certain number of people, of which you may be a part...if you follow to the letter the simple advice that I will give you in a moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm a prudent person, I decided to consult the tarot cards a second time...not just to get confirmation of my first reading, but above all to find out if this beneficial period would offer something extraordinary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And what these famous divinatory cards revealed to me about your immediate possibilities, really impressed me.\u00a0 See for yourself!\nYour Cards of Luck\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After making all necessary preparations and after concentrating for a long time, I pulled the tarot cards...exactly as I would if you were there, in front of me, in a personal consultation.\u00a0 I pulled the cards and focused on their meaning.\u00a0 I give you here what the cards showed me about what the future may bring you.\nATTENTION!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's important to me to let you know that the cards I pulled on the whole were good cards.\u00a0 However, we need to be cautious with certain cards, and I will explain the significance of this to you later in this letter.\nHERE ARE THE CARDS THAT I PULLED.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you are wondering, \"What do these cards signify for me?\"\u00a0 Are they good cards?\u00a0 Or are they bad cards?\u00a0 That's what we're going to find out for you now.\n\n\n\n\nYour Card #1: The Sun\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Children playing and an enormous sun decorate this happiest of cards.  When I drew this for you, I whispered a silent thank you to the Universe.  All is well when the Sun appears in a reading and if you have been burdened with worries, especially about your finances, then you can breathe a huge sigh of relief as help is at hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Money is so often the cause of trouble, friction and disappointment but with the Sun as one of your cards, you can be sure that you are in for some kind of windfall or increase in your prosperity.  There are a variety sources where this extra money can come from during the 30 day lucky period so stay alert and aware and back your hunches.\n\n\nWith what I saw so far, in the preliminary reading, I really wanted to write you and tell you as much as I could...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But some active involvement by you will really help to make the picture complete.\u00a0 Plus, I wanted to make sure to let you know that you have the power, right now, to bring out the very best possibilities and the greatest rewards the Empress card can signal for you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In doing this, you can not only get answers to a good number of questions that are weighing on your mind...and that you are surely asking about your difficulties and existing problems, but above all, it can help you see what's ahead for you in your future, especially\u00a0over the next 30 days.\u00a0 And the cards can also tell you how to gain the greatest advantage from incredible opportunities as they present themselves to you.\nHere are some examples of the help the cards bring you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can find out things like:\n\n\nIf opportunities for generous money winnings are going to arise for you, and what you should be realistically hoping for;\nWhen you will meet your goal of paying off your debts and collecting money that is owed to you.\nIf your near future contains anything you need to watch out for and above all, how to avoid any pitfalls or obstacles in your path!\nIf love will finally find you and if it's the person who occupies your thoughts.\nIf you can finally look forward to getting everything in life that up until now has been unfairly refused to you: love, money, luck in everything and happiness beyond your wildest dreams. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, you can finally begin to get answers on the subjects that cause you worry or bring you happiness by connecting with your own innate gifts of divination. Above all, I am happy to share with you my knowledge of this science, known as \"Cartomancy\" (the reading and interpretation of the tarot cards) so you can easily do this. Which brings us to the second card I will read for you...\n\n\n\n\nYour Card #2: Strength\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawing Strength in a reading is a message that you must love and respect yourself.  It seems as though you may be going through a period of self doubt or perhaps even suffering a drop in confidence.  Perhaps you feel that the good luck and luxurious lifestyle that other folk enjoy has passed you by.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, that is not the case and although it is often said nothing is ever gained without a little effort in this life, right now you are poised to enjoy a period when the opportunities to make some wonderful gains will come to you.  All you have to do is believe that it is your turn to enjoy the kind of life that you deserve. \n\n\n\n\nSo that I can bring you more details and you can get the best outcome possible from each card reading, I want to offer you something absolutely indispensable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With it, I can give you complementary information about these card readings.\u00a0 I can then tell you, with greater exactitude, the influence that these cards may have on your future and also give you practical guidance on how to get the outcome that's absolutely ideal for you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I promised, I will now show you how we can use the cards together to bring you money, love, luck and happiness beyond your wildest dreams.\u00a0\nTHE ORACLE CANDLE KIT\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like I've already told you, for us to continue together with this revealing journey, and to get the ideal outcomes that are in the cards for you, it's indispensable that you have these powerful tools and the secrets I will tell you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You have a radiant personal power within you, and with your Oracle Candle Kit, you can charge up my tarot reading for you with positive energy...that will give you your best chance possible to get wealth, love, success, happiness...whatever you want the most.\u00a0 With your Oracle Candle Kit, you will get:\n\n1.
