My\ninstinct is to do the following:\n\n* Allow someone to explicitly request a specific locale, ie,\n  \n* If they request the \"generic\" version, use the browser's language\ninformation to return the \"best guess\".  So if the default language in\nthe browser is pt-BR, we'd return the Brazilian Portuguese version\neven if the generic one was requested.\n\nDoes that sound reasonable?\n\n>\n> The only other issue is that the JS should be strict enough to be able\n> to be used in XUL applications as well as XHTML-Strict.\n\nI don't think it'd be appropriate for XUL applications -- for one\nthing it'll be using document.write to inject an HTML  element\n(well, several of them), which doesn't always work well in XUL in my\nexperience (iirc you have to do some special namespace declarations to\nmix XUL and HTML).\n\n>\n> If some coding time is needed, please don't hesitate to call on me.\n>\n> --Paul\n>\n>\n> All Email originating from UWC is covered by disclaimer http://www.uwc.ac.za/portal/uwc2006/content/mail_disclaimer/index.htm\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> cc-devel mailing list\n> cc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\n> http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n>\n>\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
