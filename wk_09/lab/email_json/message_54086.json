This one part of slackware that should have \nbeen fixed using different tools long ago, but I guess patrick\nfigures its not broken, so don't fix it.\n\nI was thinking, all of the content that goes into those dialog\nscreens are stored in files, so it should be possible to read\nthose files and generate an alternate install method. It would\nbe nice to have a script that makes a file containing all of \nthe install choices, similar to the kernel .config, and another\nscript that does the entire install with one command. Then \nyou could also have a default install config, and possibly \neven launch that automatically from a special boot disk.\nI may consider working on something like that some day\nbut I have too many other things I'd like to tackle first.  \n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
