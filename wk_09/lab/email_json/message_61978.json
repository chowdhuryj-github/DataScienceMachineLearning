This might work better than the LP approach, since the LP approach gives you a starting value that is on the boundary of the feasible region, i.e a vertex of the polyhedron, whereas this new approach gives you points on the interior.  You can generate as many points as you wish, but the approach is brute-force and is very inefficient - it takes on the order of a 1000 tries to find one feasible point.\n\nThanks again, Ravi. Actually, the LP approach also works here. Let\ng(X) >= k be the constraints. Then, by solving a LP problem with the\nconstraints\n\ng(X) >= (k+0.2)\n\nreturns an interior starting value for constrOptim. I am aware that\nthe new set of constraints may correspond to an impossible linear\nsystem, but it works in many cases.\n\nPaul\n\n> ----- Original Message -----\n> From: Paul Smith \n> Date: Tuesday, July 3, 2007 7:32 pm\n> Subject: Re: [R] Fine tunning rgenoud\n> To: R-help \n>\n>\n> > On 7/4/07, Ravi Varadhan  wrote:\n> >  > It should be easy enough to check that your solution is valid (i.e.\n> > a local\n> >  > minimum):  first, check to see if the solution satisfies all the\n> >  > constraints; secondly, check to see if it is an interior point\n> > (i.e. none of\n> >  > the constraints become equality); and finally, if the solution is an\n> >  > interior point, check to see whether the gradient there is close to\n> > zero.\n> >  > Note that if the solution is one of the vertices of the polyhedron,\n> > then the\n> >  > gradient may not be zero.\n> >\n> >  I am having bad luck: all constraints are satisfied, but the solution\n> >  given by constrOptim is not interior; the gradient is not equal to\n> >  zero.\n> >\n> >  Paul\n> >\n> >\n> >  > -----Original Message-----\n> >  > From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> >  > [ On Behalf Of Paul Smith\n> >  > Sent: Tuesday, July 03, 2007 5:10 PM\n> >  > To: R-help\n> >  > Subject: Re: [R] Fine tunning rgenoud\n> >  >\n> >  > On 7/3/07, Ravi Varadhan  wrote:\n> >  > > You had indicated in your previous email that you are having trouble\n> >  > finding\n> >  > > a feasible starting value for constrOptim().
