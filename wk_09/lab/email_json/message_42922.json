With forecasters predicting a 70 percent chance of good weather, the countdown is scheduled to start at 9 p.m. this evening, targeting a launch attempt at 7:38:02 p.m. Friday.\n\n\"All our systems right now are in great shape, we're tracking no constraints that are show stoppers,\" said NASA Test Director Steve Payne. \"The teams are ready and everybody's eager to launch. We're looking forward to a safe and successful assembly mission.\"\n\nShuttle weather officer Kathy Winters said today she expects a 70 percent chance of acceptable weather Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with the only concern being possible showers or thunderstorms in the area. The weather at emergency runways in California, Spain and France also is expected to be good.\n\n\"We do expect to see some afternoon thunderstorms in the area on launch day but by launch time, all that weather should move inland with the sea breeze,\" Winters said. \"So for the coast here, the weather looks reasonably promising for launch.\"\n\nAtlantis originally was scheduled for liftoff on mission STS-117 on March 15, but the flight was put on hold after a freak hail storm Feb. 26 that caused extensive damage to the protective insulation on the shuttle's external fuel tank. Repairing the tank was a major technical challenge, but NASA managers say they are satisfied the repairs will stand up to the thermal and aerodynamic rigors of launch.\n\n\"We are relieved that we're finally there,\" Payne said. \"It's been a long waiting period and as you probably know, whenever you're ready to go and you have to stop and wait for a few months, it's a disappointment. But once you spool back up and everything's ready, and it looks like everything's falling into place nicely, the team's really excited and we're ready to get off the ground.\"\n\nA detailed countdown timeline is posted on the CBS News STS-117 Quick-Look page.
