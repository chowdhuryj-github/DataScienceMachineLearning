This is\n  quite certainly the most debatable and invasive one. One of our user\n  proposed a rewrite to make ti cleaner so we'll discuss first\n  internally before submitting it.\n \n\nI will do my best to forward them later, so please consider that the\ncurrent batch ends up with the [5/10] patch..:-)\n\n\n"}
