The total prize purse of approximately $30,000 will be split between these contests.\n\nThe first contest, still entitled Apollo Reporting System, is open for registration now, with submission starting this Saturday and ending next Tuesday. It requires only the integration of the supplied ASP.NET prototype, the Report Order Processor class library and related components, and SQL Server 2005 database. The result of this contest will provide the platform for contests starting at the end of next week, and has a total prize purse of $6,000. \n\nLearn more: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&pj=30001578\n\nThe later contests will focus on specific features like graphing, web-based word-processing, user management, and so on.\n\nThe Reporting System replaces a manual process whereby customers place an order for 1 or more reports, which are then written and reviewed by several internal departments before being published and/or delivered to the customer. TopCoder is helping automate this entire process with the Reporting System, which is both a web-based management interface for report order tracking and a full back-end report processing system.\n\nGood luck!\n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
