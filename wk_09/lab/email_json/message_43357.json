We all know its good programming practice to remove\nunused functions, and we know its good practice to make a function\nstatic if its only used within one C file, yet we all still make that\nmistake time and time again.\n\nIf you do have time to write the scripts I suggested, then it will be\nreally interesting to run them on projects that have a good reputation\nfor code quality (Linux kernel and gcc are obvious examples).

A lot of what I have learnt has come from\ndiscussions like these within various projects, so don't cut it short\njust because we don't agree.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
