Here is \none way to accomplish this.\n\npng(\"aldi.png\")\nplot(x,y)\nsegments(x,y,x+2,y+2)\nsegments(x,y,x+0.5,y+0.5,col=3)\ndev.off()\n\nAfter generating the image in a format that will display on an HTML \npage, create the page.\n\n\n\nHTML image map demo\n\n\nClick on one of the points to go to another URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow if you point your browser at that HTML page, you should be able to \nclick on the first three points and be transferred to the URLs in your \nexample. Doing this in PDF should be pretty similar, but I don't know \nhow to write PDF code.\n\nHowever, if you look at the code in either the R2HTML package or the \nprettyR package, you can see how this could all be generated in R.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
