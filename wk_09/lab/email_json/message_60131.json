If you\nwant to do that, the varFunc capabilities in the 'nlme' package is the\nbest tool I know for that purpose.\n\n      If someone thinks there are better tools available for estimating\nheterscedasticity, I hope s/he will enlighten us both.\n\n      Hope this helps.\n      Spencer Graves\n\nshirley zhang wrote:\n> Thanks for Spencer and Simon's help.
