You can use any other \nsequence of numbers, e.g.\n\na.lab <- c(1,seq(5,35,5))\n\nand use it for labeling. And beware of letters format AT is not at.\n\nRegards\nPetr\n\n> \n> Petr PIKAL wrote:\n> > Hi\n> >\n> > r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch napsal dne 09.04.2007 22:10:22:\n> >\n> > \n> >> I want to produce some boxplots and plot the logged values but have \nthe \n> >> axis scale in the original, not-logged scale.
