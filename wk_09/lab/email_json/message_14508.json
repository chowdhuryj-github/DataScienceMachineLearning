The license is saying that the Code\nmust include all modifications that went into making the Subset.  You\ncan't release a patched Subset with an unpatched Code.  In other\nwords, the Code must correspond to the Subset.\n\nCheers,\nWalter Landry\nwlandry@ucsd.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
