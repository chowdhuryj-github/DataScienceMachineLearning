These RT tickets will track progress in writing \nunit tests for the Perl 5 packages under the config/ directory which \ngovern the individual steps.  The one RT approach per configuration step \nhas been discussed with particle and ptc.\n\nThe packages in question get a certain amount of test coverage already \nvia the tests already found in t/configure/*.t.  So the focus of these \nunit tests will be (a) ensuring that the Perl 5 code is good qua Perl 5; \n(b) covering as yet untested branches and conditions; (c) improving the \noften skimpy documentation of these packages; and (d) resolving other RT \ntickets referenced in inline comments in these packages as well as other \nissues raised in such inline comments.\n\nI've begun writing these tests in the 'reconfigure' branch, and every \nconfig/*/*.pm package already has a corresonding test file in that \nbranch's t/configure/ directory.  So there will be no immediate impact \non trunk.  I hope that this will provide an opportunity for people at \nthe post-YAPC hackathon in Houston who are newcomers to the Parrot \nproject to be able to make an immediate contribution.\n\nComments?  Objections?  Plaudits?  Let's hear them now.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
