The name, however, will conflict each other if they are \ndefined in the same environment, which means if you have another top and \nmainFrame passed to another function, the GUIs will get to the same \ncontainer. To avaoid this, better  use different name.\n\nI wonder if there is a way for me to create an env and eliminate an env \ndynamically, I will try to get some information, but I definitely \nwelcome some quick inputs...\n\nThanks\nHao\n\n\nJohn Fox wrote:\n\n>Dear Hao,\n>\n>You might take a look at how the Rcmdr package is implemented with many\n>reusable elements.
