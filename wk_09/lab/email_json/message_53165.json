Try to cover all branches and conditions.  Check latest\nreports of Parrot configuration tools testing coverage to see where your\ntime available for writing tests is spent.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
