There will be \n      more tonight on the CBS Evening News. \n      \nAlso,\u00a0I spoke with a storm chaser who shot some incredible \n      footage of tornados touching down in Oklahoma. Reed Timmer told us \n      he and his crew were less than 100\nyards from one powerful tornado. He said he \n      hopes his videos\u00a0that show the destruction tornados can \n      bring will teach all of us to take twisters seriously.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDr. \n      Emily Senay was here to tell us about a fascinating new study on kids watching TV.
