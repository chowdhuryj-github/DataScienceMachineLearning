It is easier if\nyou download and build the modules by hand (rather than try to use\nCPAN).  Just get the module to the point of \"make install\" and copy\nthe directory over.  Just make sure you install any dependencies\nfirst.  Oh, another gotcha is that since some Perl modules rely on\nextrenal libraries you need to make sure the two systems have all of\nthe same libraries installed.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
