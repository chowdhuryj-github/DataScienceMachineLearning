So what\u2019s\n  next? While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will work with the\n  White House to strike a deal, but she\u2019s also said \u201cthere is a\n  great distance between us right now.\u201d Jim Axelrod will have the latest\n  on the stalemate and David Martin will report on the benchmarks that may be\n  discussed for Iraq.\n\u00a0\nYesterday\u2019s immigration rallies across the United States\n  were smaller than last year\u2019s, but more than just harsh words were\n  exchanged at some of the protests. In Los\n    Angeles, protesters scuffled with police, who fired\n  rubber cartridges and used batons against the crowd. Bill Whitaker will more\n  on the backlash from the clashes.\n\u00a0\nIn medical news, a soon-to-be released study shows\n  an alarming number of American children go without basic health care.
