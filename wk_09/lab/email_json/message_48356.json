Already ordered a DoubleTalk LT.   Bugrit!\nHopefully it's understandable.  It #%&*-well had better be for the\nprice.   Oh well.  I spent $200 for WinXP in March, and Vista\nwas advertised as going for $75.  Last time I shop at CompUSA. \tIt'll be\nworth it.   Anything to ditch Win-Eyes and back to an OS I can\ntrust.  I can never seem to get Windows to act the same way twice.  When\nSpeak-Up goes USB-ready, I may consider a USB synth.  Heard there was a\nscreen reader for DOS, and was considering even that.  Maybe under\ndosemu.  I miss Aces of he Deep and sinking convoys.  I wonder if I can\nwrite a U-boat sim that can be used by the blind.  It's not like you can\nsee anything when you're 150 meters under the surface, anyway.  Sorry.\nEx-Navy here.  Thank you for the info.  I still have a laptop to buy\nfor, so...  It was either get a synth ASAP, or toss the freakin' \ncomputer out the window the next time I heard, \"Please save your work at \nthis time...\" \n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
