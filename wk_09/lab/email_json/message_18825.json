Parallel is easy enough (\"||\"), but I \nhaven't been\nable to find a way of adding perpendicular. The plotmath documentation\ndoesn't mention how to do it, so I'm inclined to think that it doesn't\nexist - but surely there must be some way of achieving the desired \nresult,\nright?\n\nAny help will be much appreciated,\n\n\n-Matt\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
