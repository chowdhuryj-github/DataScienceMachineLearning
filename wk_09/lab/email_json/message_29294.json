I have the examination results of 1000 pupils on three subjects, one score every term. So, I have three scores for English (one for every term), three scores for maths etc. However, not everybody was examined in maths, not everybody was examined in English etc, but everybody was in effect examined on four subjects. I also have information abouit the school. Would this model hive the right results for the variance components?\n\nmod_3_f  <- lmer(SCORE ~ GENDER + (1 |ID ) + (1 | TERM) + (1 | SUBJECT)  , Dataset)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML \nFormula: SCORE ~ GENDER + (1 | ID) + (1 | TERM) + (1 | SUBJECT) \n   Data: Dataset \n    AIC    BIC  logLik MLdeviance REMLdeviance\n 247882 247926 -123936     247871       247872\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n ID       (Intercept) 5.97288  2.44395 \n TERM     (Intercept) 5.10307  2.25900 \n SUBJECT  (Intercept) 0.25943  0.50934 \n Residual             4.41673  2.10160 \nnumber of obs: 53978, groups: ID, 5695; TERM, 4; SUBJECT, 4\nFixed effects:\n               Estimate Std.
