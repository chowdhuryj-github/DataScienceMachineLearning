I found that it is possible to add groups if you\ndownload 50MB ServerAdminTools from Apple and connect to the \"localhost\"\nserver with the workgroup manager tool. This was the only way I found\nout on OS X to add new groups, is there an easier way to create/manage\ngroups?\n\nThen I put myself into 17 newly created groups but \"id\" was saying that\nI would only be in 15 groups (including the group which is reported\nto be my primary group - but I don't know if OS X is actually making a\ndifference between primary and supplementary groups internally, does it?).\nSo on OS X it only seems to be possible to have 14 supplementary groups\nat all. Is this by design?\n\nThanks\nBjoern\n\n\nPS: I've put up an overview of the different group limitations of Unix\nsystems at http://j3e.de/ngroups.html Comments and additions to this are\nvery welcome.\n\n"}
