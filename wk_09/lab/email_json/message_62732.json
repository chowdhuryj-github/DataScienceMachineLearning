Brazil now imports a cheaper\ngeneric version of efavirenz, Merck's Stocrin, from India.\n\n\"The difference between the two cases was that Abbott sought an\nunderstanding with the Brazilian government,\" said Health Minister\nJose Temporao, seated next to Abbott executives.\n\nUnder WTO rules, countries can issue a \"compulsory license\" to\nmanufacture or buy generic versions of patented drugs deemed critical\nto public health.\n\nDrug makers often cut prices to keep developing countries as clients\nand avoid compulsory licenses.\n\n\"It would be very promising if Abbott's example were to be followed\nby other laboratories,\" Temporao said.\n\nBrazil has provided free universal access to AIDS drugs, condoms and\nsyringes for two decades as part of a prevention program lauded by\nthe United Nations.\n\nThe program helped Brazil slow infection rates and avoid what experts\nsaid could become an AIDS epidemic. Infection rates among adults have\nstabilized at levels similar to those in the United States.\n\nBut government spending on anti-retroviral drugs doubled in four\nyears to nearly 1 billion reais (US$495 million) in 2005, according\nto a Brazilian report for the United Nations.\n\nTemporao, a fiery new health minister who took office in March, has\nbeen outspoken in his criticism of high-priced drugs. He has also\nslashed prices on birth control pills, told men to get more\nvasectomies and angered Roman Catholic leaders by calling for a\nreferendum on whether Brazil should legalize abortion.\n\nOn Wednesday he said price talks were ongoing with many\npharmaceutical companies and that Brazil would like to produce more\ndrugs domestically.\n\nAbbott cut the price for Kaletra tablets, which currently have no\ngeneric equivalent, from a previously agreed $1.04 per pill to 73\ncents per pill this year and 63 cents in 2008.\n\nMason said the move was part of a strategy to cut prices for the\ntablets, which do not require refrigeration, for some four dozen\nmiddle-to-lower-income developing nations.\n\n\"It's a win-win situation,\" she said.\n\nBrazil will start offering Kaletra tablets to some 32,000 patients in\nSeptember, phasing out the use of capsules.\n\n\n---------\nMichelle Childs\nHead of European Affairs\nKnowledge Ecology International\nmichelle.childs@keionline.org\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
