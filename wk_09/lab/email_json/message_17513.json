Then you would be looking for \nareas of increased density on the grid (in points per unit area or equivalently \ncounts per bin) rather than at the interpoint distances. The kernel2d() \nfunction in splancs handles a data set of your size with no problems.\n\nRoger\n\n(with apologies for pruning, gmane is very dictatorial)\n\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Thierry\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
