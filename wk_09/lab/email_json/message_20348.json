It's on BBC ONE at 2305 BST.\n\n\nOn tonight's show, I meet the Chelsea and England captain, John Terry. We both have twins and I was amazed as he told me about the moment his girlfriend gave birth - all I can say is \"Respect\" to that woman!  He also revealed his love of Lionel Richie and, more seriously, what his ambitions are once his playing days are over.\n\n\nAlso tonight, remember the three blondes in a boat who won Olympic Gold in Athens?  Well now they are rivals and competing against each other for the one place in the British sailing team for Beijing. We go to meet them and witness the battle on the high seas. \n\n\nAnd we've also got exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the king of world football, Fifa boss, Sepp Blatter, and the latest on South Africa's race to be ready for the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\nI'll be joined by our regular panellists Steve Bunce and Des Kelly - these boys are not known for being shy and retiring - to debate the week's talking points. And the BBC's Sports Editor, Mihir Bose, will be with us to give us his inside track on sporting stories.\n\n\nThere's also a competition - would you like to go to the first FA Cup final at Wembley? Two tickets could be yours.\n\n\nSo I hope you can join me tonight - don't forget I'm also back on BBC TWO next Sunday at 1230 BST - you can see the big interview again and lots more new stuff.\n\n\nGabby.\n\n\n\nGabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 30 April, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and second edition, 6 May, 1230 BST on BBC TWO.\n\nIf you miss the show, you can catch up on the best bits on the website, bbc.co.uk/insidesport\n\n\n\nCOMING UP THIS WEEK ON BBC SPORT...\n\n\nWORLD SNOOKER\n\nbbc.co.uk/snooker\n\nCoverage from the Crucible every day this week on BBC TWO (Monday and Tuesday 1330-1755, Wednesday 1400-1800, Thursday 1300-1800, Friday 1330-1800). \n\nYou can also watch coverage from both tables on BBCi via the red button and on the BBC Sport website from 1000-2300 throughout the tournament.\n\n\nSCRUM V\n\nbbc.co.uk/scrumv\n\nFri 1900-2100, BBC TWO Wales, BBCi and website\n\nNewport-Gwent Dragons v Connacht.
