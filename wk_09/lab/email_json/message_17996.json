", "body": "# New Ticket Created by  Jerry Gay \n# Please include the string:  [perl #42776]\n# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. \n# \n\n\nthere are two 'isa' ops, defined in src/ops/object.ops\n\none takes a string param, and the other a pmc. it seems the string\nvariant is used frequently throughout the source and tests, but the\npmc variant is much less frequently used, and i haven't come across\nany tests, either. it seems these two ops don't agree on return\nvalue... which is problematic.\n\n  D:\\usr\\local\\parrot\\head>parrot -\n  .sub main\n      .local pmc class, obj\n      class = new 'Class'\n      obj = class.'new'()\n      $I0 = isa obj, 'Object'\n      print $I0\n      .local pmc cl\n      cl = new 'String'\n      cl = 'Object'\n      $I1 = isa obj, cl\n      print $I1\n  .end\n  ^Z\n  10\n\nwhy? iunno. but this is causing me problems when using 'isa_ok' in\n'Test/More.pir', since it uses the pmc variant.\n~jerry\n\n"}
