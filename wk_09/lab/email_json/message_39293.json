The cosmonauts installed five protective micrometeoroid debris panels on the Zvezda command module and re-positioned a GPS antenna cable on the back of the module that will be needed to route navigation data to unmanned European cargo vehicles starting late this year.\n\nThis was the 82nd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance, pushing the total amount of ISS EVA time to 503 hours and 28 minutes since construction began in 1998. Yurchikhin and Kotov plan to stage another spacewalk next Wednesday to install 12 more debris panels on the command module.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
