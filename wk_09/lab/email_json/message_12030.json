The panel function (copied from your code) is:\n\npanel.leftaxes <- function(...)\n{\n   if (panel.number() == 5)\n      panel.axis(\"left\", outside = TRUE,\n                  line.col = \"black\")\n   panel.xyplot(...)\n}\n\nThe panel.xyplot() call is not part of the if() block, so gets called\nfor all panels.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
