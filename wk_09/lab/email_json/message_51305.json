Perl counts for you. The current line number\nis always stored in the $. variable.\nmy $third;\nwhile (<$fh>) {\n   if ($. == 3) {\n       $third = $_;\n       last;\n   }\n}\n\nAlternatively, consider the Tie::File module:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Tie::File;\ntie my @lines, 'Tie::File', \"file.txt\" or die $!;\nmy $third = $lines[2];\n__END__\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
