Why?  Because that's where\nthe action is!  Those Chinese stocks just won't quit!  And neither will my\nbrain, which is still weighing the sights and sounds I experienced on my\nrecent trip there with other experiences, and occasionally coming up with\nsurprising comparisons.\n\nFor example:\n\nMy daughter who is now studying in China as a college junior spent her\nfreshman year studying at the American University of Paris.   \nAmong the first orders of business, once she arrived in Paris, was\nacquiring a mobile phone, and to do this, she needed to have a local bank\naccount.  So she walked into a bank one day, and asked to open an account.\n The response?  \"Come back tomorrow - we're too busy.\"(!!)\n\nTo me, it was a perfect illustration of the French attitude: that the job\nof the worker is more important than the needs of the customer.   \nI don't believe this could happen in America, though as time goes on I\nknow it becomes more possible.  But I know with absolute certainty that it\nwouldn't happen in China!\n\nA few weeks back, in fact, I wrote about the issue of Excess Human Capital\nin China, a reality that provides a willing worker - often two or three -\nfor any task that needs to be done.\n\nMore recently, my daughter wrote in a similar vein, and I think you'll\nfind her comments interesting.\n\n\"The Chinese people are the most overwhelmingly enthusiastic entrepreneurs\nI've ever seen. Their eagerness to seize every opportunity to sell things\nis obvious. Besides fruit, street vendors have everything from DVDs to\nbeer, from nail clippers to hot sweet potatoes, from bicycle seat covers\nto new soles for your shoes. And that's just in the back alley behind my\nschool!\n\nTheir determination to sell you stuff translates into huge benefits for\nthe customer. Not only does it mean low prices, great variety and\nconvenience - the service is also incomparable. I went to buy a laptop\nwith my friend Amanda on Monday, and it was unlike any experience you'd\nhave in the States. We started out browsing on the ground floor of one of\nthe electronics malls in Zhongguancun, where the salespeople swarming the\nfloor shout, compliment and sometimes even grab to get your attention\nfocused on their product.\n\nOnce we'd expressed interest, they all kept trying to convince us to come\nto their stores on the upper floors, explaining that the ground floor was\nclosing in ten minutes. It turned out to be true, and Amanda found a\ncouple laptops she liked, so we allowed three of the salespeople to escort\nus to the 12th floor, which they did in extremely courteous fashion. \nTheir store on the 12th floor was packed with helpful salespeople,\ncomputers and large blue couches. We sat on a couch and they gave us paper\ncups of water, then brought over several laptops and set them on the\ncoffee table in front of us to try out. The manager of the store, who\nspoke English, sat down on the couch across from us and explained the\nfeatures of each computer and told us the prices, which he could lower a\nbit . . . just for us, of course.\n\nAfter Amanda chose a laptop - small, light, and an inexpensive Chinese\nbrand - one of the salespeople installed Windows, Microsoft Office and an\ninternal wireless card for her, right there at the table. Then he gave her\na free computer bag to carry it away in, and we were escorted out of the\nbuilding by another salesperson (a girl who was very impressed by our pale\nskin, Amanda's curly red hair, and my height), who carried the computer\nout for us.\n\nThe overall feeling is that you're doing them a favor by buying the\ncomputer from them, which, given that there are at least four buildings in\nZhongguancun filled with people selling laptops, you kind of are.\n\nThe origins of this entrepreneurial spirit are complicated, and I won't\npretend to be an expert yet. But I think a lot of it comes from the\nnewness of this type of opportunity . . . as recently as the 1980s there\nwas no private property in China; all businesses were state-owned.\n\nWe're only at the mid-1950s in my history class right now, but I have\nstudied the economic reforms some in Sociology and some in Chinese, in\nwhich our current lesson is called \"Self-Employed Cucumber Seller and\nMoney Chasing\" (not kidding).\n\nAlthough tight control was and is maintained, the reforms allowed private\nbusiness and private property and gave the Chinese people a whole new\nrange of choices. The Chinese word for entering the private sector we just\nlearned in our cucumber seller lesson literally translates into \"jumping\ninto the sea.\"\n\nIt's a big deal in a country where state-owned enterprises composed the\nentirety of the economy less than a lifetime ago. The money chasing part\nof the lesson describes entrepreneurs who will sacrifice everything to\nearn money - including abandoning ethical business practices.\n\nThe point is, even by the standards of non-communist countries, the\n\"marketplace\" in China is huge, thriving, flexible and growing. And of\ncourse it's not all because of the entrepreneurial spirit; there's the\npopulation, the reinforcing effects of raising the standard of living, the\ngrowing middle class, and probably some cultural influences too. What it\nmeans for me is I can buy everything I need within a 5 minute walk from my\ndorm - and it's cheap too!\"\n\nNote: This intelligent young woman (of course I'm biased), who's majoring\nin journalism and international relations, is available for summer\nemployment opportunities in the Boston area.\n\n-----\n\nBack in Salem, which in pre-clipper ship days boasted America's greatest\nChina trade - my current view of China is centered on the charts of the\nChinese stocks that climb up my computer monitor.  And I've got to tell\nyou - they're strong!\n\nI thought we'd have some kind of pause in the Chinese market, particularly\nafter Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report was ranked the #1 advisory\nletter in the business, based on its 75% return last year.  After you're\n#1, there's no place to go but down.\n\nBut I was wrong.  While we had a quick 10% plunge in the Shanghai Index a\nfew weeks ago - just enough to shake out the weak holders - Chinese stocks\nhave roared back and are hitting new highs again!\n\nHow to explain it?  Fast growth continues, and the world's money continues\nto pour into China.  At the most basic level, demand exceeds supply; there\nsimply aren't enough Chinese stocks to go around.  Editor Paul Goodwin\nworks hard to keep an eye on every one of them, and he tells me there are\nabout 100 Chinese stocks that trade in the form of ADRs on American\nexchanges.\n\nWhen I look at the list, I see a lot of strong stocks, but I also see\nsomething else, some very big holes.  For example, there is no major\nChinese retailer.  Where we have dozens, from Gap to Target to Federated\nStores, they have none.  There is no national restaurant chain.  Where we\nhave McDonalds, Wendy's, Krispy Kreme and Starbucks, they have none. \nThere are no national food processors.  We have Dean Foods, Kraft,\nCon-Agra, Tyson and Smithfield.  They have none.\n\nAnd medical investments?  Forget it.  No hospital chains.  No assisted\nliving chains.  No biotechnology stocks.  Just a few traditional medicine\nsellers, medical device manufacturers and one Western-style clinic.\n\nPublic stock exchanges?  No.\n\nOnline brokers?  No.\n\nInsurance companies?  Just one.\n\nYou get the picture.  In time, these sectors will develop, and as they do,\nthere will more places for all this foreign capital to go.   \nUntil then, it goes where it can.  And it pushes stocks up.\n\n-----\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?\n\nPaul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks for\npromising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of\nthe BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). They must also meet\nstrict criteria regarding fundamentals and technicals.

It's not for the faint of heart; what goes\nup can come down fast, too.  But most companies in the industry are\nenjoying triple-digit growth of revenues.  Their manufacturing costs are\nfalling, as they grow volumes and develop more efficient methods.  And\ntheir profit margins are fat! We've suggested several solar investments in\nrecent issues of the Advisory, and you don't need any more.\n\nSo today I want to share with you my favorite non-solar Chinese\ninvestment.  The stock first appeared in the pages of Cabot China &\nEmerging Markets Report, but I wrote it up as Stock of the Month in early\nMarch, and what I wrote then still applies today.  Here it is:\n\n\"Let's get one thing clear here.  We're not talking about gambling; we're\ntalking about playing.  About games, in the original sense.   \nBut this isn't kid stuff.  The online game industry has grown up, and\nabsorbs billions of dollars from gamers all over the world.\n\nThe most exciting action right now is taking place in China, for reasons\nthat are not hard to understand.  GDP is growing about 10% per year.  But\nof 1.3 billion people, only 137 million have Internet access, and just\nthree-quarters of those have broadband connection, a necessity for playing\nmost of today's modern games.  So there's a vast untapped market.  But the\nindustry is growing fast; last year the number of online players increased\n20% to 31 million, and their spending on these games increased a whopping\n75%, to $830 million!\n\nThe9 Limited is our favorite of the top-tier game providers in China,\nmainly because it's the fastest-growing.  The name, admittedly awkward,\nrefers to the claim that game is the ninth art, after the traditional\neight, namely painting, sculpture, architecture, literature, music, dance,\ndrama and movies.\n\nBut the real name to remember here is World of Warcraft, because that's\nthe game that accounts for 99% of The9's revenues!  World of Warcraft,\nhereafter know as WoW, was launched by an American company, Blizzard\nEntertainment, in November 2004, and currently serves more than 8 million\nplayers worldwide.  Two million of these players are in North America, 1.5\nmillion are in Europe, and 3.5 million are in China.  And every one of\nthose Chinese players is a customer of The9, which holds the exclusive\nChinese license.\n\nWhat's so great about this game?  In a phrase, the fact that it's easy to\nbegin, but impossible to finish.  Despite the title, it's more than a war\ngame.  It's more of a quest game, in which you (via your onscreen\ncharacter) strive to complete quests.  In the early levels, these quests\nare easy to complete alone.  But as you gain in experience, and the quests\nbecome more complex, cooperation with other players - in real time -\nbecomes necessary.\n\nSo alliances are built up.  Experience builds.  Assets (gold, weapons,\nclothing) accumulate, are used, and are accumulated again ... or are\nbought and sold from other players, just as in the real world.  And the\namazing thing is that the vast majority of these other players, who are\ncooperating in real time on screen, have never met in real life.  The\nshorthand for games like this is MMORPG, for massively multiplayer online\nrole-playing game.\n\nBut on the screen, they form a society . . . and it's a big one.  In\nChina, the maximum number of payers online at one time in the fourth\nquarter was 680,000, while the average number of players online at any\ntime is 340,000.  And it's beautiful society, visually, in an epic way. \nThere are mountains, oceans, forests, towns and cities.   \nPets, beasts and monsters.  Good guys and bad guys.  And the virtual world\nis ever-evolving.  On January 1, for example, fireworks went off at\nmidnight.  On February 18, it happened again, to celebrate the lunar\nfestival (Chinese New Year).\n\nAnd sometimes, you've got to buy more software to keep up.  Back on\nJanuary 9, for example, the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands opened and demons\npoured out.  But this content was only available to purchasers of the\nBurning Crusade expansion pack.\n\nIn the U.S. you can buy WoW on Amazon for $20, and the expansion pack for\n$40.  In China, prices are lower.  But the real money is in the monthly\nfees!  In the U.S. it costs about fifty cents per day to play the game; in\nChina, it's about six cents per day.  And that's gravy for The9.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenues grew 38% from the year before to $36.2\nmillion, while earnings jumped 66% to $0.53 per share.  Equally important,\nprofit margins swelled to a fat 36.1%.\n\nSo what's in the future?  More WoW, of course.  The end of this game's\nlife is nowhere in sight.  Nevertheless, the company is bringing out a\nslew of new games that will broaden its revenue stream.  These include\nGuild Wars and Soul of The Ultimate Nation, which have been developed\nin-house, and three games that have been licensed from their makers:\nRagnarok Online 2 and Emil Chronicle Online, two cartoon-style MMORPGs,\nand Huxley, a highly-rated MMORP first-person shooter game.\n\nLooking further down the road, there's the inevitable advent of the gaming\nconsoles.  Today, you see, all gaming in China is done on computers. \nDedicated gaming machines like the Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3\nand Nintendo Wii are not allowed.  But when they are (analysts say\nMicrosoft has already partnered with The9) you can bet The9 will be there\nto serve the online market.\n\nThe stock . . . broke out to new price and RP peaks just last month and\nran up to 40 before pulling back into a consolidation phase.  As we write,\nit's pulled back to below 35 to kiss its uptrending 50-day moving average,\nand we think this presents a decent entry point.\"\n\nToday, that buy looks pretty good; the stock has climbed back to 40, and\nfound decent support there, in part because of a published report that\nU.S. giant Electronic Arts would pay $200 million for a 19% stake in NCTY.\n Electronics Arts denied this, but it's no secret the companies are\nworking closely on getting Electronic Arts' games distributed the Chinese\nmarket.  And the action of the stock confirms that belief.\n\nI think aggressive investors can buy a little now, or on any pullback\ntoward 37.\n\n-----\nEditor's note,\n\nTo receive regular updates on The9 Ltd. - including advice on when to\nsell, consider a no-risk trial subscription to the Cabot Stock of the\nMonth.
