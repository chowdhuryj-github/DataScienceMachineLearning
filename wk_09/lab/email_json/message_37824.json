We may see a bill tabled soon, and want to ensure that as \nmany people as possible know about the real issues we are trying to \ndiscuss.\n\n-- \n  Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n  Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n  rights as owners of Information Technology.
