That does *not* mean that \"anything in the\nGPL is DFSG free\" outside the context of a work licensed under the\nGPL.\n\nIt especially doesn't mean that one can construct a new license using\nselected clauses from the GPL and have those clauses in a different\ncontext be automatically \"DFSG free\".\n\nA work is free by the DFSG only by considering the entire context of\nthe terms placed upon it.\n\n-- \n \\           \"He who allows oppression, shares the crime.\"  -- Erasmus |\n  `\\                             Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
