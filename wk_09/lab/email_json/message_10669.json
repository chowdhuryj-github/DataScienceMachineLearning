Then you could you use a loop which\nrepeats while this measure is above a certain threshold, for example :\n\nwhile (epsilon > 0.0001) {\n   ... repeated expressions ...\n}\n\n\nHope that helps,\n\n-- \nJulien\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
