They happen to use the\nsame star syntax when referring to p-values as R's summary.lm command\ndoes for significance codes. R's summary command only gives one\np-value for the whole model though. I have tried searching for help on\n\"significance code\" in the R docs and this list to see what it is\nactually being calculated, but to no avail.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
