I have installed Rpad on Windows XP following\nServerNotes. During the installation, I copy the directory \"Statistics\" to\nmy perl\\lib while \"nmake\" and \"nmake install\" commands do not work althought\nperl (ActivePerl) is installed (ps. \"perl Makefile.PL\" command works). \n\nWhile I am testing Rpad, the Rpad home page loaded as normal, but after I\nclicking examples, it was loaded as source codes rather than html. I did add\na mime type for .Rpad files in conf\\mine as \"text/html     Rpad\". After I\ncheck steps I have done, they were same to the guide, therefore, I am not\nsure where I did wrong. Thank you for helping me with it.\n\nRegards\n\nCharlie\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Rpad-files-do-not-work-as-html.-tf3822524.html#a10821909\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
