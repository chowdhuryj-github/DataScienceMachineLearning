I just saw this.\n\nThe sound quality was good in so far as I could tell just sitting\naround the salon having my toes painted hot pink....\n\nIt was a satellite station of \"retro-alternative\" sort of stuff.

Or perhaps there's a less media\nindustry jaded explanation for it.... I'm sure the enduring brilliance\nof all that is Kate has something to do with it as well.\n\nXO!\nAdj.\n\n>\n> Adj.  wrote:\n>\n> > I heard Kate singing The Long and Winding Road in a salon in Mudletta\n> > Georgia.
