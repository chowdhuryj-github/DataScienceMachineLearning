Jeremy Vine will be outlining the results of a specially commissioned Newsnight opinion poll from his virtual reality studio. Gavin Esler is at Alex Salmond's count in Aberdeen. Will Mr Salmond be Scotland's new first minister? \n\n\nOne man who already holds that title for Northern Ireland is Ian Paisley - he'll be telling us just how he expects to get on with his Sinn Fein deputy first minister. \n\n\nAnd it will all be hosted by Jeremy Paxman.  He'll be quizzing the politicians from the BBC Election studio - or that is where he'll start the programme.  He'll finish in another studio entirely.  It's worth watching just to see if he makes it - or whether for the first time ever, Jeremy \"empty chairs\" himself delayed, in a BBC corridor.  \n\n\nYou really can't miss this one.\n\n\nSimon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed Newsnight?\n\nClick here to watch the latest programme online \n\n\nNewsnight Blog\n\nAdd your comments to our correspondents' blogs:\n\nCLICK HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0LAST NIGHT'S HIGHLIGHT\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRENCH CULTURE\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIs it time for the French to be more self-critical?\n\n\nWatch the item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
