You're using regular expressions, described in\nthe perlre manpage (and elsewhere). Is that the source of your\nconfusion?\n\nI think you're looking to get every hex digit pair you can match,\nmaybe? You could use m//g in list context:\n\n   my @matches = \"a40d7412\" =~  /([[:xdigit:]]{2})/g;\n\nBut that may not be what you want, especially if your data isn't just\nhex. Good luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
