I\nthink there is an equivalent method in which\n I can check whether the eigenvalues of some dual equation ( I forget\nwhat it is ) are less than one but I don't \nremember exactly what that equation is and , even if I did, I still\nwouldn't know how to do it.\n\nMaybe checking whether the absolute of the sum of the coefficients is\nless than one is okay ?\nI remember doing that in another life but I'm not sure if that's an\napproximation or an actual test.\n\n\t\nThanks for any help.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
