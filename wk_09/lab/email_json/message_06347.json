I fit y=a+b*s(x)      where s is the smooth function.\n   \n  After fitting this model with GAM in R, I want to know the form of the s(x). Any suggestion is appreciated.\n   \n  Thanks,\n  Jin\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible \"new car\" smell?\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
