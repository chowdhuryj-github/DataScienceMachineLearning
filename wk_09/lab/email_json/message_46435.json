This is presented really well in\nRggobi. \n\nHowever, for each place plotted, I have another numerical statistic between\n0 and 1 which I would like to represent by colouring the points in Rgobbi.\nHowever I do not know how to do this.\n \nThe file I am using is called places.txt and has the following contents:\n\n            Chelt     Exeter   London  Birm\nChelt   0       118     96      50\nExeter  118     0       118     163\nLondon  96      118     0       118\nBirm    50      163     118     0\n\nTo plot these, the R code is as follows:\n\nlibrary(rggobi)\nPlaces<-read.table(\"C:\\\\places.txt\")\nPlaces.location <- cmdscale(Places, k=2)\nround(Places.location,0) \ng<-ggobi(Places.location)\n\n \nNow, for each point plotted I want to assign a colour to it based on the\nstatistic in a file called PlacesStats.txt which currently has the following\nformat:\n\n0.1  0.3  0.4  0.5\n\nWith the values in order of the names of the places given above so that:\n\n0.1 is assigned to Chelt\n0.3 is assigned to Exeter\n0.4 is assigned to London\n0.7 is assigned to Birm\n\nIdeally, I want a gradient of two colours so that say, 0 = blue and 1 = red\nand values between are a mixture.\n\nAny ideas on how I could do this? Would I need to change the PlacesStats.txt\nfile so that is reads:\n\nChelt 0.1\nExeter 0.3\nLondon 0.4\nBirm 0.7\n\nfor example?\n\nI would be very grateful if anybody could help.\n\nMany thanks\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Rgobbi-and-colours-question-tf3904622.html#a11070461\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
