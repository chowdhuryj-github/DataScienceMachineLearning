Kuku is not yet added to the \ntranslation system though, we should get the maintainer to do that. Also \nwe should assign the bug to the kuku maintainer. Maybe we should change \nthe process slightly and file the ticket directly in the activity component.\n\nAnyway, do you who maintains kuku?\n\n> BTW, any news regarding the site \n> http://translate.fedoraproject.org/releases/fedora-7 ?\n>\n>   \n\nYeah, seem to be working pretty well now, there are links to project \nspecific pages on the wiki page I posted. Feel free to start translating \nthose :)\n\nMarco\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
