Thus, each time you call plot(...) with a bitmapped\ndevice, the previous output is lost.\n\nIf you want multiple plots in a bitmapped device, you would need to use\nlayout() or par(mfrow/mfcol) to define multiple plot regions within the\noverall bitmapped output.\n\nFor example:\n\njpeg(\"test.jpg\", 400, 400)\n\n# Set for 2 rows, 1 col\npar(mfrow = c(2, 1))\n\n# Set the margins to make room\npar(mar = c(1, 4, 4, 2))\n\n# Draw a barplot\nbarplot(1:5)\n\n# Set the margins to make room\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 1, 2))\n\n# Do a scatterplot\nplot(1:10)\n\n# Close the device\ndev.off()\n\n\nAdjust other pars as required.\n\nSee ?par and ?layout\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
