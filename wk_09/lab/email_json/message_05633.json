I don't have  \na 14 to check, but on a 15 I just go to File -> Save As, and change  \nthe \"Save as type\" field to \"Comma Delimited (.*.csv)\". (I suppose  \ntab delimited would be another option). Then there are two check- \nboxes below the window that allow a bit further customizing, one of  \nthem is about using value labels where defined instead of data values.\n\nHaris Skiadas\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science\nHanover College\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
