We have\nnow reached the point where wider testing of our current\nimplementation would be useful, so we have created a setup guide in\nthe Samba wiki here:\n\n  http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CTDB_Setup\n\nIf you don't have a real cluster to play with then the instructions\nalso show how to create a set of virtual nodes over loopback.\n\nYou might also be interested in a talk I gave on this last week at\nSambaXP in Germany:\n\n  http://samba.org/~tridge/sambaxp-07/ctdb.pdf\n\nWe are particularly pleased with the performance results on page 17,\nwhich show just how far we have come with clustering since the initial\n(very early) attempts at just putting the tdb databases on shared\nstorage.\n\nAt the moment ctdb does not do automatic recovery when a node goes\ndown, so it is principally useful for high performance servers rather\nthan high availability servers. We are working on automatic node\ncrash recovery now.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
