I am able to do the examples given at\nhttp://rosuda.org/Rserve/example.shtml but I can't seem to be able to find\nan example of the above anywhere. Does anyone know that java lines I would\nneed to do this?\n\nMany thanks\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/MDScale-from-within-Java-using-Rserve--tf3810221.html#a10784224\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
