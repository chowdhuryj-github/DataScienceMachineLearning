I want to use a module (FIle::Tail) but donot have permissions to install it under the perl since perl is owned by root user. Is there any way I can install this under my home directory and use it with the perl on the system? Maybe somewhere when I running make or make install is there a way to point a destination in my home directory?\n\nThanks\nRavi\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
