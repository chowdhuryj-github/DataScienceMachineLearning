In your case, the simplest one\nwould be something like (see ?panel.superpose for explanation):\n\nxyplot(Observed + Predicted ~ Time | Drug, data = mydata,\n       type = c(\"p\", \"l\"), distribute.type = TRUE)\n\nThis will work best if the Time values are ordered; otherwise you could use\n\ntype = c(\"p\", \"a\")\n\ninstead, which will be a little slower. Let us know if this doesn't\ngive you what you want, preferably with a reproducible example\nillustrating why.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
