Most if not all of the first 24 or the \nhits in the latter referred to the 'copula' package.  Have you reviewed \nthese?  The 25th hit in the latter referred to an 'fgac' package for \n'Generalized Archimedean Copula', with a Brazilian author and \nmaintainer, who presumably is not related to the 'copula' author and \nmaintainer at U. Iowa. \n\n      Also, have you tried contacting the official \"maintainers\" of \nthese packages?  You can get an email address for them from \nhelp(package=\"copula\") and help (package=\"fgac\"). \n\n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n\nGWeiss wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> I would like to implement the empirical copula in R, does anyone know if it\n> is included in a package?
