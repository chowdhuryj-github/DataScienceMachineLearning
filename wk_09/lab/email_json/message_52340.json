Actually, see ext/HTTP/ first, since the \n2 come in a pair, as a result of said discussion, and have been in \nthe Pugs repo since Feb 17th.  Actually, see \nhttp://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/ext/HTTP/docs/ first, which is a copy of \nthe important emails by Juerd which the HTTP+Web were started from. \n-- Darren Duncan\n\n"}
