If so, can\nyou please send me the tdb file?\n\ntdb should be doing range checking on all offsets from the db. If it\nisn't, then we have a bug and should fix it. The range checking code\nis what triggers the tdb to grow automatically when needed, so it\nneeds to be right even for non-corrupt databases.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
