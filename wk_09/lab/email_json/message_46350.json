By 3:11 p.m., three of the bolts had been successfully driven home - a requirement for pressing ahead with today's spacewalk - and a few minutes later, Archambault, operating the robot arm, released the now-firmly-attached truss. The fourth bolt was in place by 3:38 p.m.\n\nThe work ran about an hour behind schedule after the space station's control moment gyroscopes became \"saturated,\" losing their ability to maintain the station's orientation. This is a routine issue with gyroscope systems and after using the shuttle's thrusters to maintain control, the station gyros were reset and able to resume control.\n\nReilly and Olivas are suited up in the station's Quest airlock module. Today's spacewalk originally was scheduled to begin at 2:58 p.m., but it was delayed, along with truss attachment, by the gyro problem. As of 3:34 p.m., the crew was preparing to depressurizing the airlock, which would result in a spacewalk start time of around 4:10 p.m.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
