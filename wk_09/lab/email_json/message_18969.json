The problem is that for \nhigh resolutions, cex has to be high (e.g., around 5) for the tick \nand curve labels to be legible. The curve and tick labels were tiny \nwhen I used cex=1 and set the other cex values to 1/5. But when cex \nis high, then the Hmisc curve labels become too large. I don't doubt \nthat I'm doing something wrong, I just can't figure out what.\n\nAnd I want the integer curve labels because I will have many lines \nand multiple plots, and need to keep the labels brief.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n>Brian O'Connor wrote:\n>>R-Masters,\n>>\n>>I need to produce high resolution line plots and place labels on \n>>the curves.
