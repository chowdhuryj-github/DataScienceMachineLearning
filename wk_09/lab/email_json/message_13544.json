In one of the examples I found that they had used \"trace=TRUE\"  with the method \"SANN\". I am using the method \"BFGS\" and I tried using \"trace=TRUE\" too but I did not get the parameter estimates at each iteration. As you say, it might be method dependent. I tried reading the source code for \"optim\" but could not find out what I was looking for. Hence, I was wondering if anyone could tell me what option to use with the method \"BFGS\" to get the parameter estimates at each iteration of the optimization.>> Deepankar>   \nWell, ?optim has:\n     The 'control' argument is a list that can supply any of the     following components:\n     'trace' Non-negative integer. If positive, tracing information on          the progress of the optimization is produced. Higher values          may produce more tracing information: for method '\"L-BFGS-B\"'          there are six levels of tracing.  (To understand exactly what          these do see the source code: higher levels give more          detail.)\nwhich I can only infer that you still haven't read...\n\n>> ----- Original Message -----> From: Peter Dalgaard > Date: Monday, April 23, 2007 2:46 am> Subject: Re: [R] Estimates at each iteration of optim()?>>   >> DEEPANKAR BASU wrote:>>     >>> I am trying to maximise a complicated loglikelihood function with >>>       >> the \"optim\" command.
