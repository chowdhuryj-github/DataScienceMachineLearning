At work, I have a proxy, and at home, I do not.  I have, for work, a User environment variable \"http_proxy\" which I set in the OS (Windows XP Pro).  When I am at work, and I try to retrieve data from the web with 'read.csv', things work just fine.  I assume it knows how to use the proxy.\n\nThe trouble is when I am at home and have no proxy, R still tries to use my work proxy.  I have tried the following:\n\nSys.setenv(\"http_proxy\"=\"\")\nSys.setenv(\"no_proxy\"=TRUE)\nSys.setenv(\"no_proxy\"=1)\n\nnone of which seems to work.  Whenever I try to use read.csv, it tells me that it cannot find my work proxy, which I am trying to tell R to ignore.\n\nI can solve this problem by removing the http_proxy environment variable binding in the OS when at home, but that is a pain, because then I have to reset it when I go back into work.\n\nIs there a way to tell R within a session to ignore the proxy?  If so, what am I doing wrong?\n\nthanks,\nmatt\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
