If I was still convinced that I should be able to\nread the files then I would write a quick Perl script to try to open\nand read the first line out of each file.  If that worked, but the\nparser code didn't, well, I don't know what I would do.  Maybe check\nto see if there is some weird ACL stuff going on.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
