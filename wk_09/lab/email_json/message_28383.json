They wouldn't dare.\nLet us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.\nA man paints with his brains and not with his hands.\nBetter a snotty child than his nose wiped off.\nFor organizations and employees alike, the only real security is the ability to grow, change and adapt.\nNo scoundrel is so stupid as to not find a reason for his vile conduct.\nI owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite.\nOne of the most striking signs of the decay of art is when we see its separate forms jumbled together.\nAuthority without wisdom is like a heavy ax without an edge, fitter to bruise than to polish.\nA man cannot be made comfortable without his own approval.\nIn every man's heart there is a secret nerve that answers to the vibrations of beauty.\nArt, whose honesty must work through artifice, cannot avoid cheating truth.\nAll things come from above.\nIt is a mistake to expect good work from expatriates for it is not what they do that matters but what they are not doing.\nDrinking is the soldier's pleasure.\n\u00a0"}
