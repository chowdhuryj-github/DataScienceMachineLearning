Ubuntu comes with Festival, which is supported by \nSpeech-dispatcher. You can add supported synts, such as Festival-Lite or \nEspeak.\nInstall Speech-Dispatcher and Speechd-up, and then check the following \nfiles to set SD up:\n/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf\nand\n/etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/yoursynth.conf\nthat means search in that directory for the file that configures the \nsynth of your choice.\nIt runs without any problems on a less powerful machine; I use a 1 Ghz \nAMD-Duron with 240 MBs of RAM. Problems with slow processors and not \nenugh memory start when you use Gnome with Orca. But that's a different \nstory.\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
