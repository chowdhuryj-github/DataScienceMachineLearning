As I'm trying to\nteach myself more and more about R, and dealing with lists, it occurred to\nme that it might be fun to remove (as in delete) a single tree from a\nforest...say to go from 500 to 499.\n\nI know, I know... \"why?\"\n\nWhy, to play, of course!\n\nI've been doing a lot of reading on various tuning parameters, and wanted to\nplay with \"thinning\" as a demonstration project. Problem is, each \"tree\" is\na different length (naturally), and when I try to set a portion (identified\nby examining the getTree function) to \"NULL\", I get an error about lengths\nnot matching up.\n\nWondering if there's a tool somewhere out there to do this in a\nstraightforward fashion, or any breadcrumbs to get me going. If this is a\n\"new\" thing, I'll post the function when I'm done for others to play with\nit, too.\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------\nDavid L.
