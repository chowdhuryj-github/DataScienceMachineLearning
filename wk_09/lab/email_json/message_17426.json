Therefore I want to \"use encoding...\" but first I have to determine\nwhich encoding the uploaded file is.\n\nIn addition I do not want to save the content to a File::Temp to run \"file\" on it.\n\nIs there a solution in pure perl for this problem?\n\n\nhttp://search.cpan.org/~cwest/ppt-0.14/bin/file is the best thing I found so far, but it only showes me this:\n\n# ./file *\ncp1252.txt: text\niso-8859-1.text: text\nmacintosh.text: text\nutf16.text: data\nutf8.text: text\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
