I am \nespecially interested in test statistics have some asymptotic \nparametric distribution that is independent of sample size or values \nof fitted parameters (e.g., a chi-squared distribution with some \nfixed df), because I want to fit gamma distributions to a large \nnumber of data sets (of varying sample size), and then compare the \nfrequency distribution of test statistics with their expected \ndistribution under the null hypothesis that the data really are \ngamma-distributed. An example might be the test proposed in Kallioras \net al, 2006, Communications in Statistics--Theory and Methods 35: 527-540.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\nSean\n\n\n********************************************\nSean R.
