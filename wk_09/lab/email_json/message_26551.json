I'll let it run tests overnight and \nsubmit a cleaned-up patch tomorrow.  I've gone back and reviewed the \nalignment issue and think I have implemented it sanely.\n\nThe nice thing about the way Leo set this up is you can now swap out \nentire parts of the GC system.  I think this will help tracking some of \nthe memory problems I've been running into.  Or at least tell me where \nthey aren't.\n\n-- \n    Andy Spieherty\t\tspiehera@lafayette.edu\n\n"}
