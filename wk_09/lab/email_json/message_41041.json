Genius coming from reason and imagination, rarely.\nIn argument similes are like songs in love they describe much, but prove nothing.\nTo love one that is great, is almost to be great one's self.\nThe brave don't live forever, but the cautious don't live at all. Here's to the brave!\nBoredom is always counter-revolutionary. Always.\nRead nothing that you do not care to remember, and remember nothing you do not mean to use.\nBeware of one who has nothing to lose.\nChildhood is a disease -- a sickness that you grow out of.\nWhat we are doing at the moment is more that just one thing added to the rest it is a memoir.\nThat which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly.\nBeware of one who has nothing to lose.\nEvery blade of grass has its angel that bends over it and whispers, grow, grow.\nWhen people are bored it is primarily with themselves.\nI thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out and I thought how it is worse, perhaps, to be locked in.\nYou learn from a conglomeration of the incredible past -- whatever experience gotten in any way whatsoever.\nThat which has been believed by everyone, always and everywhere, has every chance of being false.\nWherever man goes to dwell his character goes with him.\nThey that sow in tears shall reap joy. [Psalms 126:5]\nA critic is a man who knows the way, but can't drive the car.\n\u00a0"}
