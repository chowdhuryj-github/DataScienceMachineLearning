Well until a couple days ago that \nwas working well.  By now, subscription entries that had been working \nperfectly well before show up as downloads but this time the podcasts \nthemselves are being saved as single files with the names chosen as \nurl-name before.  For this to have happened, probably some pretty \nconsiderable changes were done recently in python recently since podracer \nhasn't had an update for debian lately.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
