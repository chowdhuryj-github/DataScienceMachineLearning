Gagel\" <gagel@cnc.bc.ca>", "subject": "perl 5.8.8 install problem", "body": "I run SpamAssassin on a RHEL 4 box with the FuzzyOCR plugin. This\ncombonation was sending errors to my log files so often that my server\nslowed down. Follow up on the cause revealed an upgrade to 5.8.8 would\ncorrect the problem.\n\nUnfortuantly I've spent a few days cleaning up the aftermath of the\nproblems that were created. I'm not stuck with a few problems I can't seem\nto find the answer to. I'm hoping someone here can help me out because I'm\nnot to up on perl yet.\n\nAnyway, what I did was remove the current installation of perl using the\nrpm command to erase it. Since it complained about dependants and I was\nabout to re-install it I used the nodeps option.\n\nThen I installed perl 5.8.8 and re-installed my modules that I use.\nSpecifically SpamAssassin. When I try to run spamd I get this error now:\n[root@avas ~]# /etc/init.d/spamassassin start\nStarting spamd: Can't locate object method \"register_domain\" via package\n\"IO::Socket::INET\" at\n/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/IO/Socket/INET.pm line 22.\nCompilation failed in require at /usr/bin/spamd line 44.\nBEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/bin/spamd line 79.\n                                                           [FAILED]\nThe INET installed went in with no problem and is:\ncpan[12]> install IO::Socket::INET\nIO::Socket::INET is up to date (1.31).\n\nMy web server could not start until I commented out the following line:\n#LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so\n\nThe error I get with that active is:\nMay  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: Syntax error on line 26 of\n/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf:\nMay  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: Invalid command 'PerlTaintCheck', perhaps\nmis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\nMay  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: httpd startup failed\n\nmod_perl.so existed in the /etc/httpd/modules directory but foolishly I\ndeleted it thinking that re-installing the mod_perl package would bring\nback the correct one. Nope - that was wrong.\n\nSo, now I don't have a mod_perl for apache and my spamassassin won't run\nbecause of some strange perl error.\n\nCan someone shed some light on this for me... What should I do now?\n\n\n=================================\nKevin W.
