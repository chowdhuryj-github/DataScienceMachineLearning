Rather than just showing the variables as\nvectors (with arrows at end point), I would like to show them as line\nsegments, where the segment runs from minimum value of the variable to its\nmaximum.  In other words, I would like to produce a plot similar to that\nshown in Figure 1 of Gabriel and Odoroff (1990), rather than the classical\nbiplot shown in Figure 2 of the same paper.   Has anyone generated biplots\nsimilar to Figure 1 of Gabriel and Odoroff?\n\n \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\nRavi.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n\nRavi Varadhan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, The Center on Aging and Health\n\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology \n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nPh: (410) 502-2619\n\nFax: (410) 614-9625\n\nEmail: rvaradhan@jhmi.edu\n\nWebpage:  http://www.jhsph.edu/agingandhealth/People/Faculty/Varadhan.html\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------\n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
