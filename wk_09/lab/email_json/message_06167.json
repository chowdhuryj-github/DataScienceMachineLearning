I downloaded the most recent version  \nof Ghostscript from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ that I could find  \n(v.8.56) for Mac OSX. However, I am apparently quite ignorant about  \nhow the required Ghostscript software works.\nWhen I run PostScriptTrace after loading the grImport package, I get  \nthis response:\n\n > PostScriptTrace(\"/Users/erinberryman/Documents/data.ps\")\n\nError in PostScriptTrace(\"/Users/erinberryman/Documents/data.ps\") :\n\tstatus 256 in running command 'gs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE - \nsDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=/dev/null -sstdout=data.ps.xml  \ncapturedata.ps'\nESP Ghostscript 7.07.1: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1\n\nI am confused by the mention of a Ghostscript 7.07.1, because that is  \nnot the version that I have installed on my computer. After running a  \nsearch of the R archives, I began to think that maybe I needed to  \ntell R where my Ghostscript is, so I began to look for it. Now here  \nis where I feel I am missing some key concept, because I find a  \nfolder called \"ghostscript-8.56\" that contains many files and folders  \nwith more files, and I have no idea which file is THE ghostscript  \nthat grImport wants to use. I used the following code to try to  \ndirect R to the correct folder for Ghostscript:\n\n > Sys.putenv(R_GSCMD=\"/Users/erinberryman/ghostscript-8.56\")\n > PostScriptTrace(\"/Users/erinberryman/Documents/data.ps\")\n\nError in PostScriptTrace(\"/Users/erinberryman/Documentsdata.ps\") :\n\tstatus 32256 in running command '/Users/erinberryman/ \nghostscript-8.56 -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=/ \ndev/null -sstdout=data.ps.xml capturedata.ps'\n/bin/sh: line 1: /Users/erinberryman/ghostscript-8.56: is a directory\n\nRight, it is a directory indeed, but I do not know which specific  \nfile to give, since there are so many of them in that Ghostscript  \ninstall.\n\nHopefully there is a solution that a non-computer whiz like me can  \nhandle?\n\nThank you,\n\nErin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
