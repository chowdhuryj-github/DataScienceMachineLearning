I do need to learn more.  I never learned null/residual\ndeviance.  I know the deviance is equivalent to an anova decompostion.  But\nI've never dealt with it seperated like this.  \n\nI understand deviance as the difference between two model's log-likelihood\ndifference between them and the most complex.  I want to compare two models\nthat are not the most complex.  That is why I wanted the log-likelihood.  \n\nI am using the poisson distribution because my response is count data, so\nthe link is the log.  If the deviance in R is computed by comparing the\nfitted model against the most saturated (which would make sense).  Then yes,\nI can use that.  I just picked the log-likelihood because I'm comparing two\nmodels.  And that's the best way.  But, it's equivalent if R compares the\nfitted to the most complex.\n\nI assumed the deviance print out tested the fitted model against the least\ncomplex.  This tests whether the current model parameters can be dropped\n(that's what I thought the null deviance meant).  I'm not sure what the\nresidaul deviance means though.  \n\nMy main concern is why the likelihood functions differed between SAS and R. \nIf anyone has encountered this or understands why, I would appreciate some\nhelp.\n\n\n\nProf Brian Ripley wrote:\n> \n> I think you need to learn about deviances, which R does print.\n> \n> Log-likelihoods are only defined up to additive constants.
