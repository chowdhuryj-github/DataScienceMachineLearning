One of them lacked all of the menus, and it played very\nnicely with speakup.  I believe the name of the program was\nsetup.tty.  Unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared.\n\nThe menu problem is caused by a little utility named \"dialog\", that\nallows one to display dialogs within shell scripts.\nI think it should be possible to hack dialog so that it displays menus\nwith numbered options, rather than cursor-selectable options.  Such\nmenus work well with screenreaders.  \nPerhaps the dialog tool could number its options if an environment\nvariable were set.\nHas anyone on the list given much thought to this problem?\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
