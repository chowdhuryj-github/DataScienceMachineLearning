So I used the command \"StructTS\" but I failed to obtain a desirable output, in fact when I write in R Console the following lines:\n> x=(1,2,3,4,5,2,25,14,12,13,11,6,9,24,12,13,14,12,12,14,11,12,14,15,20,21,22,23,21,25,28)\n>(fit <- StructTS(x,type = \"BSM\"))\nI obtained the following message:\"error in makeBSM(x, nf): the frequency has to be  positif  entire for BSM\"\nI would like via this command(StrucTS) obtain estimation of seasonality and local level trend components of the time series \"x\".\nCan you help me please . Thanks.\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
