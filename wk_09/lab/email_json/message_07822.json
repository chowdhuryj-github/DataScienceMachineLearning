The offending code starts around line 177 in print.xtable.R (#based on contribution from Jonathan Swinton  in e-mail dated Wednesday, January 17, 2007). I did try to write a sanitize.text.function= solution, but failed, and backed off to an earlier version. Could the maintainer David Dahl, please address this, and include a relevant test? (I would CC him, but am travelling and posting via gmane to keep thr thread together - I apologize for pruning, but gmane won't post otherwise).\nSo a solution is to install an earlier version of xtable from the package archives, a harder but feasible task for Windows.\nRoger\n\n...\n> > Thank You,> > Andris Jankevics> > On Pirmdiena, 16.
