The files:\n\nLICENSES/Artistic\nLICENSES/gpl.txt\n\nchange to just:\n\nLICENSE\n\nwhich is a copy of the Artistic License 2.0. \n(http://foundation.perl.org/legal/licenses/artistic-2_0.txt)\n\nThe README file also needs to change to reflect the new license.\n\n\"This code is distributed under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 \nwhich can be found in the file LICENSE.\"\n\nAllison\n\n"}
