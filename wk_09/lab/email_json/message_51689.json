I've tried as a standard user and as root.  I don't understand why that the patching of speakup is causing this error when issuing the mrproper command.  Because the file named in the error isn't part of the tar ball in the first place.  The mrproper command doesn't produce this error until the kernel has been patched with speakup.

I've built speakup into the kernel, oh thinking about it, the only speakup module is the software synth.  Which I haven't attempted to run.
