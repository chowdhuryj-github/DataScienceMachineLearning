Today I got the HP XC1000 media\ncable from ebay to solve the problem with power jack. The cable has an\ns-video and my laptop's video card has a video-out.\n\nI'd like to connect this laptop to TV to be able to watch DVD's on a\nbigger screen. How can I do this ? Do I need to edit xorg.conf ? Did\nanybody do that ? With this cable ?\n\nAny suggestions will be very welcome...\n\nTIA\n\nBTW, I am running Etch.\n\n\n-- \n\"I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without\nhate.
