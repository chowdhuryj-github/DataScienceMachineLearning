Unfortunately, none of these are exactly \nwhat I'm looking for.  I'm looking for the following:  Suppose object y \nexists and object z does not exist.  If I pass y as the value of the \nargument to my function, I want to be able to verify, inside my function, \nthe existence of y; similarly, if I pass z as the value of the argument, I \nwant to be able to see, inside the function, that z doesn't exist.\n\nThe missing function just checks whether the argument is missing; in my \ncase, the argument is not missing, but the object may not exist.  And the \nway you use the exists function inside the user-defined function doesn't \ntest the argument to the user-defined function, it's just hard-coded for the \nobject y.  So I'm sorry if I wasn't clear before, and I hope this is clear \nnow.  Perhaps what I'm attempting to do is unavailable because it's a bad \nprogramming paradigm.  But even an explanation if that's the case would be \nappreciated.\n\n--  TMK  --\n212-460-5430\thome\n917-656-5351\tcell\n\n\n\n>From: \"Liaw, Andy\" \n>To: \"Talbot Katz\" ,r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>Subject: RE: [R] Testing for existence inside a function  [Broadcast]\n>Date: Tue, 15 May 2007 11:03:12 -0400\n>\n>Not sure which one you want, but the following should cover it:\n>\n>R> f <- function(x) c(x=missing(x), y=exists(\"y\"))\n>R> f(1)\n>     x     y\n>FALSE FALSE\n>R> f()\n>     x     y\n>  TRUE FALSE\n>R> y <- 1\n>R> f()\n>    x    y\n>TRUE TRUE\n>R> f(1)\n>     x     y\n>FALSE  TRUE\n>\n>Andy\n>\n>From: Talbot Katz\n> >\n> > Hi.\n> >\n> > I'm having trouble testing for existence of an object inside\n> > a function.\n> >\n> > Suppose I have a function:\n> >\n> > f<-function(x){\n> > ...\n> > }\n> >\n> > and I call it with argument y:\n> >\n> > f(y)\n> >\n> > I'd like to check inside the function whether argument y\n> > exists.
