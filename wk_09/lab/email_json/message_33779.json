As I mentioned, I know very little\nabout programming in 'R' and what I've got is a BASH script.  If needs be,\nI'll look up how to read in a text file through R and add that into your\nscript in lieu of the (argv) stuff, but you wouldn't happen to know how to\naccomplish the same thing using the \n\nR CMD INSTALL\n\nShell command?\n\nThanks!\n\n-Kermit\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dirk Eddelbuettel [mailto:edd@debian.org] \nSent: Monday, May 21, 2007 12:00 PM\nTo: k_short@lanl.gov\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Installing packages from command line on Linux RHEL4\n\n\nHi Kernit,\n\nOn 21 May 2007 at 11:37, Kermit Short wrote:\n| Greetings.\n| \n|    I am a System Administrator, and thus have very little knowledge of R\n| itself.
