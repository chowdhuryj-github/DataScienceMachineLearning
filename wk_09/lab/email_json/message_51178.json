(I am going over these basics so that you can\nunderstand what I mean next).\n\nI would like to see just part of the above result, namely the nine plots in\nthe top right of the given plot, or;\n\na vs. d | a vs. e | a vs. f\nb vs. d | b vs. e | b vs. f\nc vs. d | c vs. e | c vs. f\n\nI tried a number of ways to do this, but I can't find either the right\nformula or the right function to get what I want.\n\nAny suggestions you can give (especially any not involving the source code\nof 'pairs') are most welcome.\n\nDan.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
