This is\na great scheme that allows Debian to use Perl in the base system,\nwithout requiring the loads of unused modules that usually come with it.\nIf you need those modules, though, you can easily install them.\n\nIt would be great if Perl had this by default, because it would make it\neasier for vendors to choose to use Perl in their base system. It would\nalso make Perl a more attractive choice for embedded systems.\n-- \nkorajn salutojn,\n\n  juerd waalboer:  perl hacker   \n  convolution:     ict solutions and consultancy \n"}
