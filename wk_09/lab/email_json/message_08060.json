As the Albarghouti video \n      illustrates, ordinary citizens can have real incentives to get compelling \n      material of dangerous situations and send them to news outlets.

The effect of mentioning \n      race can be powerfully harmful. It can subject people to unfair treatment \n      based simply on skin color and heritage.\"[+ Read More]\n\n E-mail us your questions, tips, \n      concerns Public Eye RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEditor's \n      Picks\n\u00a0\n\u201c48 \n      Hours\u201d In The Case Of The Altered Image\n\u00a0\n'Sunday \n      Morning' Apologizes Over David Pogue Segment\n\u00a0\nStop \n      The Bode Bashing!\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
