Our news stories feature\nchildren shooting up schools, corrupt politicians, thieving CEOs and\nmore.\n\nYet for most of us, life is pretty good.  And most of us don't get our\nsafe, happy lives splashed on Page 1 because, well, it wouldn't sell\nnewspapers.\n\nI'm not going to blame the media here, though I do sympathize with Tony\nBlair, who likened the famously vicious British media \"feral dogs.\"\n\nThe media serves the market.\n\nAnd if you take the market out of the equation, and simply publish the\ngood news, what do you get?   You get China Daily, the English-language\npaper that I read several times when I was over there this spring.\n\nControlled by the Communist Party of China, the paper tends to publish\nstories that glorify the progress being made in China.  You get stories\nabout the economic growth of rural districts, about the educational\ntriumphs of young scholars, about factories being constructed and roads\nbeing built, etc.\n\nRiveting journalism it's not.\n\nBut China Daily does present one side of the truth well, the fact that\nChina is booming.\n\nIn fact, China's boom is unlike any seen before on this world.  It's the\nmost populous country on earth.  It's a Communist state driven by\ncapitalism.  And it's in transition.  But to where?\n\nThe \"experts\" certainly don't know.   If you ask a dozen political and\neconomic experts where China is going, you'll get a dozen responses.\n\nAnd I don't know either.  But I don't need to know.\n\nWhen I jumped on China's uptrend over three years ago, and published the\nfirst issue of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, I didn't know where\nit was going.  But I knew the trend was up!  Back then there were only a\nhandful of Chinese stocks to buy.\n\nToday there are over 100 Chinese stocks traded here in the U.S., and I'm\nproud that Cabot China & Emerging Markets was recognized as the top\nperformer off all investment newsletters in the country last year, with a\nreturn of 76%.\n\nEditor Paul Goodwin continues to ride the wave this year, while\ndiversifying prudently into stocks of Russia, India and Brazil.\n\nBig winners include Ctrip, up 130%, Vimpel, up 65% and Focus Media, up\n91%.\n\nThe issue just published features one of my favorite Chinese stocks.   \nIt's a big old state-owned oil company with a sweetheart deal that would\nbe criminal in the U.S., but is working very well for both this company\nand country right now.\n\nYou've got to read it to believe it.\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/207047/13148861/92/0/\n\n\nYours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,\n\nTimothy Lutts\nPublisher\nCabot Wealth Advisory\n\nP.S.  As we all know, the Olympics is coming to Beijing next summer, and\nthe Communist leaders are going to pull out all the stops to show the\nworld how far they've come.  If you want to make money by investing in\nChina, there's no better time to start than now!\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/207047/13148861/92/0/\n\n-----\n\nCabot Wealth Advisory, a free thrice-weekly e-mail service brought to you\nby the Cabot family of investment newsletters.
