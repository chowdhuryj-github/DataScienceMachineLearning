Because the program didn't compile \nit didn't run.\n\nNow you've managed to get it to compile, perl has run your program.\n\nThese errors are run-time errors. In other words, they show errors in your \nlogic rather than your syntax.\n\nAs a further clue, look at how you are indexing the array - specifically on \nline 11.  If necessary, walk through the program with pen and paper.\n\nThe mistake you've made is a common one\n\nGary\n\n(BTW, please keep things on-list so others can share/help)\n-- \nGary Stainburn\n \nThis email does not contain private or confidential material as it\nmay be snooped on by interested government parties for unknown\nand undisclosed purposes - Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, 2000     \n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
