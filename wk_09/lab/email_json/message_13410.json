(2) Conciousness is\n\tconcious.  (3) [I can't --- thank God --- remember.]\n\n\tWhen I was in graduate school, lo these many years ago, I had\n\ta friend who was a very right-wing person from the South of\n\tthe U. S. and who might have been expected to have some\n\tsympathy with Ayn Rand's views.  This friend had a gift for\n\tsuccinct and pithy aphorisms.  He remarked:  ``Anyone who can\n\tsay `Existence exists' with a straight face is either a fool\n\tor a charlatan.''\n\n                                cheers,\n\n                                        Rolf Turner\n                                        rolf@math.unb.ca\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
