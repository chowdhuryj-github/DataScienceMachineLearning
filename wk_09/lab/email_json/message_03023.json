It seems that this part\nis effectively the MySQL Reference Manual in some form and was until\nSarge distributed in non-free and part of package mysql-nonfree.  Is\nthat right?\n\nAnyway according to bug #308680 this package was removed because the \nmanual was at the time undistributable.\n\nHowever according to the MySQL website the license for the Reference\nmanual now contains the following ...\n\n\"You shall not publish or distribute this documentation in any form or\non any media, except if you distribute the documentation in a manner\nsimilar to how MySQL disseminates it (that is, electronically for\ndownload on a Web site with the software) or on a CD-ROM or similar\nmedium, provided however that the documentation is disseminated together\nwith the software on the same medium\"\n\nMy interpretation is that it would now be OK to resurrect mysql-nonfree.\nWhich would be useful to me as I'm still learning the in and outs of\nMySQL's SQL syntax and it's a bit of a pain to have to keep searching on\nthe online version :-)\n\nIs there any interest in resurrecting this package?\n\nCheers,\n\n    David.\n\nP.S.
