Dare to be wise begin.\n\nEducation makes a people easy to lead, but difficult to drive easy to govern, but impossible to enslave.\n\nBe true to your work, your word, and your friend.\n\nLook a man in the eye and say what you really think, don't just smile at him and say what you're supposed to think.\n\nTake heed of critics even when they are not fair resist them even when they are.\n\n\n"}
