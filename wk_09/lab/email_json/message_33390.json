Should assigning an arrayref to an array dereference?\n\nNo, an array in list context only flattens when it has the @ sigil, or\nwhen it is explicitly flattened with the [] postcircumfix operator, or\nthe | prefix operator.\n\n>    Which Synopses describes this?\n\nS03\n\n> 2. Shouldn't .perl generally use parens for outputting arrays (at\n>    least on the most outer level)?\n\nNo, because parens are just for grouping and controlling precedence.\nThey are not constructors.\n\nNote that in this assignment,\n\n    my @foo = @bar;\n\n@bar is in list context. The syntax is ARRAY = LIST; and not\nARRAY = ARRAY.\n\nAssigning an array to an array seems kind of useless to me. Binding\nprobably makes a bit more sense:\n\n    my @foo := @bar;\n\nThat's ARRAY := ARRAY there, so the following should dwym:\n\n    my @foo := [ 1, 2, 3 ];\n\nHowever, this does not work with pugs, so I don't know if I am wrong, or\npugs is wrong.\n-- \nkorajn salutojn,\n\n  juerd waalboer:  perl hacker   \n  convolution:     ict solutions and consultancy \n"}
