I've downloaded the live CD images, gone  \nthrough several wiki how-to pages, nothing seems current nor working.\n\nI've tried Q (Qemu) and parallels.  385 just crashes the parallels VM  \nand the live images are \"not bootable\" according to Q.\n\nI've got Unbuntu Edgy installed, but i wanted something closer to the  \nreal hardware.  I suppose I will go about getting sugar running in  \nUbuntu now.\n\nAny clue as to what is the best way to get a image up for developing?\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
