Something like\nthis should work:\n\n./sugar-jhbuild shell\ncd source/sugar\n./sugar-emulator\n\nThe only thing which is still running from the installation directory\nare the services scripts. It should not be a big problem in practice\nbecause they are loading the actual code from the source directory too.\n\nIf you find any bugs with this please let me know.\n\nMarco\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
