If it's mgcv::gam then all the smooth terms are \nrepresented using a basis expansion, so it is possible to write down the \nfunctional form used. The forms used are given in Chapter 4 of my book \n(see ?gam for reference). It is also possible for `s' terms (but not `lo' \nterms) in gam::gam, although you might need to do a little digging into the \nsource code for some of the details of the basis used. However, quite often \nwhen people ask for the functional form it is only in order to get at some \nother quantity, and there turns out to be  an easier way to get to it. What \nwere you plan to use the functional form for? \n\nSimon\n\n\nOn Monday 16 April 2007 02:13, Jin Huang wrote:\n> Hi, all,\n>\n>   Does anyone know how to get the functional form of the smooth terms in\n> GAM? eg.
