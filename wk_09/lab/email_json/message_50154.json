It's setting was Bristol University for the 1985-6 school year, and it had two Kate Bush references.\n1. Near the beginning, Brian and his two pre-college buddies are on a pier and one fellow pulls out \"The best tape I ever made!\" to put in their jam box. It's all Kate, but we never hear it because the other buddy grabs it and throws it off the pier.\n2. On New Years Eve, Brian and Rebecca are starting to get it on, and Kate singing The Man With The Child In His Eyes on a record in the background, when Rebecca says \"We can't start 1986 listening to this moaning!\" and they put on a different record. (This is just before Brian calls Rebecca Alice and ruins his chances)\n.\nRegards,\nNeal Mulvenna\n"}
