If gentoo or ubuntoo or any distro \ndoesn't include speakup, how about a script that grabs \na kernel from kernel.org, extracts, patches, compiles, \nand installs it? I once made a script that built an entire\nlinux system from scratch, I mean building the toolchain\nand all, if that's possible surely this is too. I suppose the\ntricky part is kernel config, but even then it should be \npossible to make a generic kernel that would boot with\nspeech on just about anything, with some work.\n\nOr, you could use slackware, hehe. \nScrew gentoo. Just kidding.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
