I know a lot of people prefer a white\nbackground with black gridlines (and many journals require it) but it\nhasn't been a priority.  It is on my todo list, and hopefully it will\nmake it in the next release of ggplot (probably 7-10 days from now)\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
