My understanding is that with usb serial console \nyou may miss a bit of the initial boot messages, but I \nwonder how it might work if speakup was in user space\nand we could use usb serial adapters. We'd miss a few\nof the initial boot messages but enable more widespread\nuse of speakup. One way or another this usb problem \nneeds to be sorted out. I have heard it mentioned by \nsomeone, I forget who, that a hybrid solution might \nbe the answer, some kernel space and some user.\nIt could be argued that a lot of what happens with \nspeakup is application code, and if the line was drawn\nbetween actual hardware drivers and application code\nthen there would be better chance of getting speakup\ninto the official kernel. And this, of course, would be \nthe best thing to happen. If it was all in the kernel with\nno patches required then there would be none of this\ndiscussion about gentoo or ubuntu not supporting it.\nBut presumably the whole thing would have to be \nre-written. I can think of another reason to do this\nhybrid idea, to enable getting speakup beyond x86\nand into ARM for example. There is no ISA bus \nthere and interrupts are completely different. If it \nwas well engineered as hybrid, with a \"port\" being\ngenerically abstracted in the application code, then\nit would not matter if the actual port was ISA or \nPCI card or USB or firewire, or some other thing\nthat hasn't been invented yet.\n\nI have an interim suggestion though. Couldn't one\nmake a small root filesystem that loads speakup \nlike as a rescue CD, but not a CD, on the hard \ndrive, for those situations where the regular distro\nisn't speaking for whatever reason? If you always\nhad a small partition like this bootable with speech\nthen you could at least boot that and then fix your\nfull fledged distro if need be. Also wondering if \nanyone has tried using chroot in this sort of way,\nbooting minimal system with speech and then \nchrooting into the full system.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
