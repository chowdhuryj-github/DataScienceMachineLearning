The reason I bring this up is I like my\ndectalk express at rate 0 as the default rate that is set in speakup is a\nlittle faster then I can handle.  This is why it would be nice to be able\nto set these at load time not after booting threw either proc or the\nspeakup review keys.  It could also be a configuration option in the\nkernel configuration when building speakup.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
