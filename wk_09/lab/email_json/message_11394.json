Iwas\na bit upset the first time I saw it until I realised\nthe write command was working just fine.\n\n> \n> Moreover is there any way by which i can get the\n> data of *mat2* beside the\n> data of *mat1* instead of below?\n\nI suspect that you would have to join the two matrices\ntogether in R. \n\ncbind the two matrices xx <- cbind(mat1, mat2)  and\nthen save the resulting larger matrix X .  Will that\nwork?\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
