Here's what's happened since:\n\n= Test coverage =\n\nCode coverage in Samba 4 is now up to 41.4% and with a bit of luck and\nsome more work, we'll be able to get close to the targeted 50% before\nSambaXP.\n\nPretty much all tests in Samba4 are now run as part of \"make test\", but\nsome of them are marked as known failing. If you don't know what to work\non, the file 'samba4-knownfailure' in Subversion should give a good\nindication of things that need fixing :-)\n\n= Test environment =\n\nSupport has been added for different \"test environments\". At the moment,\nthe supported environments are:\n\n * dc - A domain controller (the only environment that existed previously)\n * member - A domain member joined to a domain controlled by Samba4\n * none - No server whatsoever (used for local tests)\n\nThe member test environment is new and should be ideal for testing\nthings like spoolss callbacks and winbind.\n\nIt should be easy to add a \"2dcs\" environment for testing trusted domains.\n\n= Backporting to Samba 3 =\n\nThe selftest code in Samba 4 supports running against both Samba3 and\nSamba4 (all the version-specific code is in separate files), which makes\nsharing this infrastructure code between both branches easier.\n\nIt is also much easier now to test with domains that contain both Samba3\nand Samba4 hosts.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niQCVAwUBRiZG+gy0JeEGD2blAQKnywQAk50IsD9MPTKKLWuMrwhHpS1ieBFTmT/j\nkX3GQUxD1got28kmRgyruFvMr7Dy69WFzj00/DhzyNVzazg9CLa8n5KNVcLDDg08\nnhwFGW0PQLLJbCRP28GqOqZBLGIXD3bNe3bfbgpXAeZt1lH3M+P/1/trt86ya3r/\ntRrN0DokPsY=\n=daUI\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
