Is \nthere a way to install slackware that bypasses all the stupid menus?  Or \nis there a way how I can better identify what is selected?  I know about \nthe \"cursoring up is better\" part, as what you're on is said first, \nfollowed by what you've left.  Tried turning cursor tracking on and off, \ntoo.  The docs say just to type in the kernal's name: speakup.s  Maybe \nopening another terminal and finding...damn I hate menus.  Give me an \nalias, any day.   Oh well.
