I'll start on that now.  If you could at least\nverify that the executables are what you expect, that would be great.\nThanks.  go to packaging/RHEL4-CTDB and run makerpms.sh.  You'll either need\nto add a release tarball's \"docs\" directory in, or specify the path to one\nvia the DOCS_DIR variable before calling makerpms (it will move the dummy\ndocs dir out of the way, symlink yours in, build a tarball for the rpmbuild\nprocess, then move it all back at the end).\n\n-- \n-------------------\nJim McDonough\nSamba Team\njmcd at samba dot org\n\n"}
