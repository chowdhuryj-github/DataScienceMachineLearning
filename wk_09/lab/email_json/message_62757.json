I found this line in the sample instructions:\n\"If you want to use the accompanying ActionScript libraries, you will \nwant to add the |/lib/| directory to your Classpath in the Flash \nauthoring environment.\"\nHow do I add to the Flash Authoring Environment Classpath when I am \nusing SWF::Builder to generate the swf files?\nI tried using:\n$ENV{'CLASSPATH'} = '/path/to/lib';\nin the perl script, but it did not help.\nAny help is appreciated.\nThank you.\nShannon\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
