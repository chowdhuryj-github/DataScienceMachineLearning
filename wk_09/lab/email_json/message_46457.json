If so, lynx isn't like that. Up and down\narrow in lynx takes you to next and previous hyperlinks, not lines of\ntext on screen. Tab and Alt-Tab will do the same, by the way. Please\nnote it's the old, traditional Unix Alt-Tab, and not Windows Shift-Tab\nfor backward motion in lynx.\n\nPS; Michael, do you think you might limit yourself to one though per\nsentence? I, for one, would find it much easier to answer your questions\nif you could learn to end one sentence before starting another thought.\n\n\nI'm willing to wager you've heard this criticism from various teachers\nbefore, but you needn't answer me on that, of course.\n\nJanina\n\nMichael Weaver writes:\n> I have set the cursor on, forms and links for numbers, user mode to\n> advanced and underlined links to on so why am I having problem with\n> links being read out on a line when I use the standard up and down\n> arrow keys, links being repeated and for example when I go to google,\n> the form for search isn't announced as if there is no number for the\n> edit field when doing a search or am I missing something in settings\n> which is making it more difficult to focus which why I am having\n> difficulty scrolling down web pages using up and down arrow?\n> Do I perhaps need to use the speakup keystrokes for navigating through\n> pages more than I would normally when using a web browser in Windows\n> where I can go up and down pages with the standard arrow keys and it\n> reads either text or links depending on where you are on a page rather\n> than trying to put all the links together and maybe causing a problem\n> when navigating?\n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n-- \n\nJanina Sajka,\tPhone:\t+1.202.595.7777;\tsip:janina@a11y.org\nPartner, Capital Accessibility LLC\thttp://CapitalAccessibility.Com\n\nMarketing the Owasys 22C talking screenless cell phone in the U.S. and Canada\nLearn more at http://ScreenlessPhone.Com\n\nChair, Open Accessibility\tjanina@a11y.org\t\nLinux Foundation\t\thttp://a11y.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
