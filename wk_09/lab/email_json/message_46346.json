The Company is focused on gold as well as  base metals such as tungsten and uranium. PCFG owns and operates five  subsidiaries that control several thousand acres of mineral leases and  mining claims in Nevada, Oregon and Colorado.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\"PCFG plans to grow by purchasing or leasing existing mineral  deposits across North America. According to management, with the  acquisition of Project W, a large tungsten-based deposit, the Company  had achieved approximately 55% of its goal in August 2005. To date,  the gross value of PCFG's estimated gold, tungsten, vanadium and  uranium resources approaches $1.7 billion, which make us to conclude  that the 2009 target could be achieved.\"\nOther companies in the gold production market include Barrick Gold  Corp (NYSE:ABX - News), Gold Corp (NYSE:GG - News) and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM - News).\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWish to no longer get mail, rmove here\n\n\n\n"}
