I've never seen this \"below a certain value\" \nMethodology  but maybe it's popular and I just don't know about it. \nI'm unsure if you can assign success and failure in a chi square\nframework by \"below a certain value\". I don't think so. And I think\nThat you also have seperate multiple experiments ( each level seems like\na new experiment to me ) so your alpha level is going to be messed up\nalso. I'd be interested in hearing other viewpoints but I'm fairly\ncertain that your approach needs modifications.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of\ngenomenet@gmail.com\nSent: Wednesday, June 27, 2007 11:51 AM\nTo: r-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] how to use chi-square to test correlation question\n\nHi There,\n\nThere are 300 boy students and 100 girl students in a class. One\ninteresting question is whether boy is smarter than girl or not.\n\nfirst given the exam with a difficulty level 1, the number of the\nstudent who got A is below\n31 for boy, 10 for girl.\n\nThen we increase the difficulty level of the exam to level 2, the number\nof the student who got A is below\n32 for boy, 10 for girl.\n\nWe did this 10 times, we got the following table\n                                    score gender  level1 level2 levle3\nlevel4 level5 level6 level7 level 8 level9 level10\nboy       31     32      33     34     35     36     37     38     39\n40\ngirl      10     10      10     10     10     10     10     10     10\n10\n\n\nMy question is how to use chi-square test to test if score is\nindependent of gender.\nThat is whether boys is significantly smarter than girls.\n\nI used a chisquare test to do this.\nThe null hypothesis is score is not correlated with gender. and we can\nalso say the null hypothesis is boys are the same smart as girls.\nthe alternative hypothesis is that boys are significantly smarter than\ngirls.\n\nboyscore=c(31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40)\ngirlscore=c(10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10)\nratioscore=boyscore/girlscore;\nexpratio=300/100;   #300 boy students and 100 girl students\n\nchisq=sum((expratio-ratioscore)^2/expratio)\ndf=9\npvalue=1-pchisq(chisq,df)\n\nSince the pvalue (0.9984578) is greater than significance level (0.05),\nwe cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the conclusion is that\nboys are not significantly smarter than girls.\nor we can say the conclusion is that score is not correlated with\ngender.\n\nAm I right?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nVan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
