It may be the case that udev is loading \ndriver modules in an order that is causing problems. It may \nbe useful to try booting without udev. Also in a situation like\nthis some manual loading of modules one by one might shed\nsome light on the situation.\n\nlsmod will show loaded modules\ninsmod will install a module\nrmmod will remove a module\nmodprobe is another way to load a module\n\nYou could try using rmmod to remove all audio related \ndrivers then start loading them one by one watching for\nany error messages on load, something like\n\nmodprobe snd\nmodprobe soundcore\nmodprobe snd-ens1371\nmodprobe snd-emu10k1\nmodprobe snd-mixer-oss\nmodeprobe snd-seq-oss\nmodprobe snd-pcm-oss\n\nNote there may be options on the modules for the card drivers \n(ensoniq and sblive) that can tweak their configuration on load, \nsee the alsa pages for details. Also this may be useful\n\nhttp://alsa.opensrc.org/MultipleCards\n\ngoogle alsa multiple sound cards\nwill reveal tons of more info including others' dual sound card \nproblems and solutions\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
