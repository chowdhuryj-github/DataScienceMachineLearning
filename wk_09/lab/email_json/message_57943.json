In the license header of a source file being licensed under the \nGPL, there must be a copyright notice. Sometimes I see the usage of \"All \nrights reserved\" in that notice:\n\n// Copyright (C) 2007, Company X. All rights reserved.\n\n1) Is the usage of \"All rights reserved\" appropriate when a file is \nbeing licensed under the GPL, or in fact under whatever license?\n\n2) What is the purpose of its usage?\n\n3) If it is that the licensor wants to say: \"Any rights I have not \nexplicitly given you, you do not have\"?\n\n4) If so, would it not be necessary, strictly speaking, to say so, i.e. \n\"All rights regarding this work, unless explicitly granted to the \nlicensee, are reserved by the licensor\"? \"All rights reserved\" seems to \nbe inappropriate, if not incorrect, when in fact all rights are *not* \nreserved.\n\n5) Is it *advisable* to use such a terminology in a copyright statement \nin a file licensed under the GPL?\n\nThanks for your thoughts.\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
