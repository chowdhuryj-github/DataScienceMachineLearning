I simply would like to have black \ngrid lines and a white background. No problem, I thought, \"This is R. \nThere is no if. Only how.\" (fortune(\"Simon Blomberg\")). \n\nI carfully checked the ggplot2 homepage  \nand the ggplot2 book . \n\nIt seemed that the use of ggopt would be a good idea, in particular \ngrid.colour. \n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nx <- rnorm(100)\ny <- rnorm(100)\n## the default behaviour\n(a <- qplot(x,y))\n## my attempt to change the default behaviour\nggopt(grid.colour = \"black\", grid.fill = \"white\", background.colour = \n\"black\")\n(b <- qplot(x,y))\n\n(Of course, I also gave ggtheme a try but without success.)\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't found any solution for my problem which I \ncould hardly believe. I strongly suspect that it's my fault but would \nappreciate any hint like RTFM on page XXX or so. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBernd\n\n\n[1] The red arrows indicate what I mean by \"white grid lines\" \n\n\n[2] I found some reasons why Hadley Wickham prefers the default theme \nat , but \nmost of our journals reject the use of any gray shading.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
