In one of the examples I found that they had used \"trace=TRUE\"  with the method \"SANN\". I am using the method \"BFGS\" and I tried using \"trace=TRUE\" too but I did not get the parameter estimates at each iteration. As you say, it might be method dependent. I tried reading the source code for \"optim\" but could not find out what I was looking for. Hence, I was wondering if anyone could tell me what option to use with the method \"BFGS\" to get the parameter estimates at each iteration of the optimization.\n\nDeepankar\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Peter Dalgaard \nDate: Monday, April 23, 2007 2:46 am\nSubject: Re: [R] Estimates at each iteration of optim()?\n\n> DEEPANKAR BASU wrote:\n> > I am trying to maximise a complicated loglikelihood function with \n> the \"optim\" command.
