Does this installation support installation using\nsoftware speech or just hardware speech and does it add\npeople.debian.org/~shane to the /etc/apt/sources.list file or will I need\nto readd that line myself once I get debian reinstalled?  What version of\nthe kernel are you using on this net installation CD as I have a dectalk\nexpress and am aware of the bugs in 2.6.20 until the latest fixes that is\nwhy I am wondering what kernel version is in the netinstallation CD.  I\nalso want to try to install etch on my laptop that has no serian port so\nthat is why I am wondering of software speech during the installation as\nno information is in the readme file about this.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
