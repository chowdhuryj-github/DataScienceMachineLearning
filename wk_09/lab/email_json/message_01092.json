I think (2) from your explanation hits the right point. The reason is that when I made my own dummy variables and my original nominal variable has 10 possible values, it makes each each observed exogeneous variable vector of mine has 9 zeros and 1 one value. And I have about 400000 observations. So it will make the matrix almost zero.One more question. If I have a nominal response, I guess the tsls would no longer work. How can I go around with this? Says, I have 3 equations in my structure model whose responses are continuous whereas another one has multinominal response.
