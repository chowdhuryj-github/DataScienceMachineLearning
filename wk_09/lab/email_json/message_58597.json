What makes you think\n> one of them is \"dominant\"?\n\nWhen I run it I get eigenvectors 3 and 6 both purely real.\nIt may be that Marco has confused this with \"dominant\".\n\nAlso, the eigenvalues of these two are real, and have the largest\nreal parts (+/- 1.3076605).\n\nAll others have complex eigenvalues, of which the real parts are\n+/- 0.6538302.\n\nIt may be that Marco has been misled by this, perceiving the real\npart rather than both real and complex parts, and being led to think\nthat the largest real part corresponds to the largest eigenvalue.\n\nAs has been clearly pointed out, this is not the way to look at it!\n\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 29-Jun-07                                       Time: 22:47:01\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
