Check the header of the email in your Junk/Spam folder and\nsee why it got put there in the first place.  With spam-assassin running\non your mail server, it should put the score in the header.\n\nYou have some digging to do to figure out why, but the first spot should\nbe local machine, then server, then mail message.  Bad formatted headers\nwill do more harm then good, so getting things correct there might help\nwith scores on the other end.\n\nHTH,\nWolf\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Anish Kumar K \nDate: Thursday, April 12, 2007 9:17 am\nSubject: Mails should not go in SPAM Box\nTo: beginners@perl.org\n\n> Hi\n> \n> Mails which are send by the perl script are usually found in the \n> SPAM or \n> JUNK as a result most of the mails are not seen by the recipient. \n> Is \n> there any way in the perl script we can set some Magical Header :) \n> by \n> which the mail goes to INBOX only.
