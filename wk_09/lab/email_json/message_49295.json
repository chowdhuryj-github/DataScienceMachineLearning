So he argues the use of the\n*original* debian logos.\n\nI would suggest that in every style made, the original logo should be\nused and the original Debian word (font and i dot colour). \n\n> \n> Jmak\n> \n> \n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
