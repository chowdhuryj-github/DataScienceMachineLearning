So let me ask this.  I understand that you wanted to be able to\nto be able to look up both the unix and ntgroup names in the group\nmapping tables.  But I'm pretty sure that we decided not to do\nthis in the 3.0.23 changes and just require the mapped named\nin things like \"valid users\".\n\nSo my question is, \"Do you still think your change is necessary?\"\nit only exists in the SAMBA_3_0 tree btw.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGVy13IR7qMdg1EfYRApVYAKDyInZOclY7+i/FwiC+llZzJr85ZACfb33B\nKHtQmEoLTPIvb5CAGkF9qsM=\n=89gU\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
