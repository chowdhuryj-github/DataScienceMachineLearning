The details we have are quite unnerving. A vehicle packed with explosives that might never have been noticed had not an ambulance crew been called to the scene for a completely unrelated matter. Twelve hours on - all we're being told is that the device was potentially viable and could have caused carnage. \n\n\nBut do security services know more about this operation than they're letting on to us? We hope to talk to those at the Home Office later. \n\n\nThose at the Home Office of course have only been in the job twenty four hours. Indeed some of them appeared - disarmingly - in news conferences today before they had even technically been announced. A former top police chief will be advising Zombie Brown on international security issues, a former First Sea Lord will be Home Office Minister for Security. \n\n\nThe new PM did promise a government of 'all the talents' but what do his long suffering Labour MPs - who didn't make the cabinet - make of all this parachuting? Michael Crick is on the case and we'll be talking to our political panel to give us their take on an extraordinary week in British politics. \n\n\nSmoking Ban\n\n\nAnd with only two days to go before the smoking ban comes into force in England, we ask if the tobacco companies themselves are worried about falling revenues. Experience of the Irish ban suggests they still know exactly who to target and how to keep smoking numbers up. So how do they do it?   \n\n\n\nMissed Newsnight?\n\nClick here to watch the latest programme online \n\n\nNewsnight Blog\n\nAdd your comments to our correspondents' blogs:\n\nCLICK HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsnight review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPRESENTED BY KIRSTY WARK\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Review tonight, it's Damon Albarn, Lou Reed, Mark E Smith, Johnny Vegas, Stewart Lee, and ... Shrek on a special edition of the programme.\n\n\nWe're live from the brand new Manchester International Festival, and I'll be joined by Paul Morley, Miranda Sawyer and John Harris for an extended edition of the programme at The Lowry Centre over the water in Salford.\n\n\nMONKEY: JOURNEY TO THE WEST\n\n\nThis will be a biennial Festival and its big sell is as a festival of \"global premieres\", with 25 new works commissioned, and commissions come no bigger than the spectacle that opened the festival last night.\n\n\nMonkey: Journey to the West, is a circus opera based on the most famous of the Chinese myth cycles, the fable of the monkey king. The book was banned during the Cultural Revolution, but was known to TV audiences here during the 70s and 80s. Now it's been reinvented by the creative combo of Damon Albarn, composing, Jamie Hewlett, designing, and the towering talent of the Chinese opera director Chen Shi- Zheng adapting and directing. A troupe of Chinese singers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists take to the stage, with an orchestra that reads like the United Nations. I'll be taking to Damon, Jamie and Shi-Zheng \n\n\nINTERIORS\n\n\nAt six o'clock tonight Paul, Miranda, John and I will be picked up from a bus stop in Manchester and taken to a secret location, a house somewhere in the suburbs. There, along with 16 other members of \"the audience\" we will become part of \"Interiors\" the new site specific play devised by Johnny Vegas and Stewart Lee. \n\n\nThere we will meet Geoffrey Parkin, who is hoping to sell his home to fund his relocation to Montenegro. Intrigued? We are. Meanwhile, Johnny Vegas reveals his secret side to Newsnight Review.\n\n\nPERVERTED BY LANGUAGE\n\n\nThe Fall are part of Manchester's DNA, and Perverted by Language is a new book of short stories inspired by Fall song titles. There are contributions by Michel Faber, Stewart Lee and Stav Sheraz amongst the 23 authors. Newsnight's culture correspondent Steve Smith spoke to Mark E Smith about Manchester fame and this new fiction.\n\n\nLOU REED\n\n\nLou Reed is also in town to perform the British premiere of his dark drug infested narrative album Berlin - the story of the desperate downward spiral of a lowlife couple, Caroline and Jim. Originally recorded in London with great musicians including Stevie Winwood and Jack Bruce - we don't yet know who'll be on stage with him tonight. He'll perform a track for Newsnight Review.\n\n\nSHREK THE THIRD\n\n\nAnd from the demimonde of Lou Reed we are transported into the realm of Shrek and Fiona - no sooner have they embarked on wedded bliss than the frog king croaks it, naming Shrek as his reluctant heir AND Fiona's piling on the pressure for the patter of tiny claws. \n\n\nShrek's in a state and he has to find Artie - Fiona's long lost cousin - and persuade him to take the throne in his place. Hence Justin Timberlake joins the Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, Rupert Everett gang in Shrek The Third.\n\n\nDo join us tonight for the Manchester International Festival special, from the Lowry Centre in Salford. \n\n\nKirsty     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
