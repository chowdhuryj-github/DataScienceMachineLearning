My first interpretation was that using some\n>different from i/n (e.g. i/(n+1)), let to better individuate tail \n>differences (maybe...)\n\nThe chief advantage to i/(n+1) is that you don't generate 1.0 as an \nabscissa, as you do with i/n. But the same is true of (i-0.5)/n, and \nit's more accurate.\n\nUnless you need to do otherwise, just use ecdf(), because it matches \nthe theory for most uses, and it almost always doesn't matter that \nit's slightly less accurate than other choices.\n\n================================================================\nRobert A.
