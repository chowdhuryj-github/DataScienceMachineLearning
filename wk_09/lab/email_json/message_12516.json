The new US DST\nwas compensated for quite some time before the change was in effect.  I only\nhad problems on some clients' unpatched winslop boxes.  The Debian package\nthat keeps track of this is tzdata - if it's kept updated, political changes\nof timezones will be compensated for.\n\n> \n> I have always set UTC=yes there, and it works just fine.

I do this on all my straight *nix boxes - easier that way, and IMHO\nmuch more sane.\n\n> Of course if you are unlucky enough to have to reboot into some\n> operating system which doesn't support the idea of the hardware clock\n> being set to a standard time then no UTC for you! :-)\n\nI believe the OP was doing a dual boot with winslop, hence the extra\ngyration.\n\nCheers,\n\nDave.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
