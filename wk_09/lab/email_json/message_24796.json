Nothing new there.\n\nI'm trying to automate the process of moving the dev site to the live \nsite (the dev sites are on a Fedora server on my desk and the live sites \non a Redhat server in a data centre 200 miles away).\n\nI've written scripts to copy the scripts and modules (and other \nassociated files) to my local machine and ftp them to the live server \nand these work fine.\n\nHowever the final stage is to be able to bring the database structures \ninto sync. Currently I keep a list of all the fields/tables/changes I've \nmade and do this manually. I also check the table strcutres by hand to \nbe sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nI'd like to find a way of comparing the two MySQL database strcutures \nand getting a list of the differences, anyone know of any \nmodules/methods for doing this?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nNigel\n\n--\nMIS Web Design\nhttp://www.miswebdesign.com/\n\nMIS Web Design Limited is registered in England and Wales with company \nnumber 04561623.
