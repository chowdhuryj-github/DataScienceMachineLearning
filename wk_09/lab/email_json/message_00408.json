I asked recently \nabout some anomalies in the S4 bit introduced for 2.4.0 and what the \nintended semantics are.)  I've said before that I believe we can only \nhelp solve some of the efficiency issues with S4 if we have a technical \nmanual.\n\nIt is unfair to pick out S4 here, but the 'R Internals' manual is an \nattempt to document important implementation details (mainly by studying \nthe code), and that has only got most of the way through src/main/*.c.\n\n-- \nBrian D.
