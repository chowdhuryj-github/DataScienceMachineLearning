I'm not sure if this is useful to anyone, but I wanted to throw\nit out just in case.\nThe scroll lock, under Linux at least, can be used for its intended\npurpose - to freeze the screen. If scroll lock is on, anything written\nto your terminal will be suspended. When you turn it back off again, any\nnewly written text will start to be written. In a shell at least, you\ncan press control-s and control-q to get the same affect, most of the\ntime, unless another program has redefined them. Useful on remote\nsystems.\n- - Tyler\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (FreeBSD)\n\niD8DBQFGK3LATsjaYASMWKQRAvddAJ9Vni6bvm8apzea4UULyuzZWZsn5gCdFf91\nIT276yybP7MIfrH/OIwhU1w=\n=qUIS\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
