I am using R\n2.4.1 for Windows.\n\nSuppose what I am looking for is called\n\"return.value.assigned\". Then one might use it like\nthis\n\n    myfunction <- function () {\n        # Create bigobject here\n\n        if (return.value.assigned()) {\n            bigobject\n        } else {\n            summary(bigobject)\n        }\n    }\n\nand\n\n    x <- myfunction()  # bigobject is assigned\n\n    myfunction()       # summary of bigobject is printed\n\nOctave and MATLAB have the nargout function that does\nwhat I want, and Perl has the wantarray function\ndetecting the context in which a function is called.\nPerhaps match.call() can be made to do what I want,\nbut, if so, I don't see it in reading the\ndocumentation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Laub\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
