The dependency generation is\ntoolchain independent, but since there's no portable method for\ndoing makefile includes, we can actually use the dependencies with\nGNU make. It's easy to add this for other makes, but I don't have\nany to test.\n\nThis also moves as much m4 as possible into the m4 directory where\nno-one has to look at it. AFAICT, there's no way to hide depcomp\nin there too, which is unfortunate.\n\nAdded:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/depcomp\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/aclocal.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/check_gnu_make.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/cond.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/depend.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/depout.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/lead-dot.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/make.m4\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/m4/substnot.m4\nRemoved:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/aclocal.m4\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/Makefile.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/autogen.sh\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/configure.in\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (2071 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22441\n\n"}
