If you're doing LFS then \"you're on your own\" it is not \nreasonable to expect people to make software \"LFS compatible\".\nBut then if you're into LFS then surely you can make whatever \nminor tweaks necessary to adapt, and that will be half the fun.\nSlack and LFS are two of my fave distros. Less is more :)\n\nGena wrote:\nThe lfs team have a script to unpack debs and rpms.  So that they can \nbe installed on a lfs / blfs system.
