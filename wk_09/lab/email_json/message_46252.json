The entire \nprocess didn't implemented to the end because an error message, \"singular \ngradient\". I knew that some sub-sets (columns) do not fit my formula well \nand may result in parameters going to infinity. It is pretty hard to remove \nthose sub sets before running the code since that will take a lot of time.\n\nI added some logic assessments prior to running nonlinear fit. It helped \nbut some exceptions still existed. I am wondering if there is any way in R \nby which I can continue to run the entire code to the end by ignoring the \nerror message?\n\nGreatly appreciate your help,\n\nJianping\n\n##################################\nJianping Jin Ph.D.\nBioinformatics scientist\nCenter for Bioinformatics\nRoom 3133 Bioinformatics building\nCB# 7104\nUniversity of Chapel Hill\nChapel Hill, NC 27599\nPhone: (919)843-6105\nFAX:   (919)843-3103\nE-Mail: jjin@email.unc.edu\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
