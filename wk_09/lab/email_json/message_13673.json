Diggle, Heagerty,\nLiang, and Zeger , 2002, (ANALYSIS OF LONGITUDINAL DATA) say on p.316: \"An\nemerging consensus is that analysis of data with potentially informative\ndropouts necessarily involves assumptions which are difficult, or even\nimpossible, to check from the observed data.\"  This was ca 1994, I believe,\nso I don't know whether this view is still held among experts (which I am\nnot). But if it is, you may do well to be careful of whatever SAS does even\nif you do have to go running off to it.\n\nCheers,\n\nBert Gunter\nGenentech Nonclinical Statistics\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Spielas Grove\nSent: Monday, April 23, 2007 10:58 AM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] fitting mixed models to censored data?\n\nHi,\n\nI'm trying to figure out if there are any packages allowing\none to fit mixed models (or non-linear mixed models) to data\nthat includes censoring.\n\nI've done some searching already on CRAN and through the mailing\nlist archives, but haven't discovered anything.  Since I may well\nhave done a poor job searching I thought I'd ask here prior to\ngiving up.\n\nI understand that SAS's proc nlmixed can accomodate censoring\n(though proc mixed apparently can't), so if I can't find \nsomething available in R, I'll have to break down and use\nthat.  Please, save me from having to use SAS!\n\nThanks much,\nSpie\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
