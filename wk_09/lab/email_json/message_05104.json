Technically, what you had said before is \nperfectly correct, but\nthinking of the file as being licenced under the combination of the \nconditions is also perfectly valid\n(as long as you realize that if the parts are seperated, the original lices \nstill apply, of course).\n\nIn summary, just make sure you meet all the terms of both, and you are fine. \n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
