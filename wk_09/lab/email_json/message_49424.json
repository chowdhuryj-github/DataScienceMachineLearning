Second, is there a way I can\n> have speech-dispatcher and speechd-up start automatically with the\n> computer?  I always have to do it manually after login.\n>\n> Thanks,\n> Terrence\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
