I didn't know about top posting, and made a brief search about it so I ask you pardon for my mistake.\n\nI don't know much about sound, so I'll leave that for other listmembers. There's kernel support for some TI mmc/sd readers (see Device\ndrivers/Misc devices and Device drivers/MMC / SD Card support) but Ihave no experience with it. A quick google for \"Broadcom Dell 1390wireless\" indicates that it's a rebranded Broadcom 43xx chip, so it\nmight work with the (in mainline kernel) bcm43xx driver. It shouldcertainly work with ndiswrapper.\nI will try to make my wireless card work with this driver.\nI work with multimedia so I need the sound working, I will try to make it work with Etch until have success :D\n\nThanks for your help! \n\n"}
