The\n(American) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data sets\nare used to evaluate the performance of these software\npackages with regard to univariate summary statistics, one-way ANOVA, linear\nregression, and nonlinear regression. Previous\nresearch has examined various versions of these software packages using the\nNIST data sets, but typically with fewer software\npackages than used in this study. This study provides insight into a\nrelative comparison of a wide variety of software packages\nincluding two free statistical software packages, basic and advanced\nstatistical software packages, and the popular Excel package.\nSubstantive improvements from previous software reliability assessments are\nnoted. Plots of principal components of a measure of\nthe correct number of significant digits reveal how these packages tend to\ncluster for ANOVA and nonlinear regression.\n\n\nBest,\nRob\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
