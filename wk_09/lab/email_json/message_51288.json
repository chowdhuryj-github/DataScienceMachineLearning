Come rapidly up to speed via a step-by-step introduction to this critical financial technique.\n\n\n\n\nMedia Sponsors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure projects to utilize non- or limited-recourse,\n  off-balance-sheet debt\n\nLearn how to identify, evaluate and allocate the risks in\n  your project to maximize your flexibility, liquidity,\n  and profits\n\nUnderstand how to source capital for your project via\n          the equity, commercial bank, B-loan, private placement\n          and financial guarantee markets\n\n\nBecause project finance permits the use of large amounts of limited    \n          recourse debt, it will be used to finance hundreds of billions of dollars\n          in private infrastructure projects worldwide this year. This increasingly\n          critical financial technique replaces collateral with contractual\n          agreements, permitting deals to be constructed that provide maximum\n          flexibility, liquidity, tax benefits and profits.          \nThis program will take you step by step through the issues that are\n          essential to all project financings. An introduction lays out how a\n          successful project financing will analyze and allocate project risks\n          contractually to create the stable cash flows that are the bedrock of this\n          financing technique. This is followed by talks from several key parties\n          to those contracts, discussing each type of project risk and how those\n          risks will be assumed or mitigated. Then we hear from speakers who\n          will brief us on what is required in today\u2019s equity, bank debt, B-loan,\n          private placement and financial guarantee markets to source capital for\n          your project. Finally, we provide two in-depth examinations of real-world\n          project financings.          \nPlease review our complete program and remarkable list of speakers\n          and reserve your place today.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Miss the Pre-Tutorial Workshop:\n        Monday, July 23, 1-5pm\n        Project Finance Terms, Principles and Goals:\n        A Half-Day Primer\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to gvwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
