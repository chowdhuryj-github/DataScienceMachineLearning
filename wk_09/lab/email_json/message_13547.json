And so I keep on pushing.\n\nOne often has need of one, inferior to himself.\n\nWhen people complain of life, it is almost always because they have asked impossible things of it.\n\nI tend to play mostly villains and twisted people. Unsavory guys. I think it's my face, the way I look.\n\nIt's never too late to have a happy childhood.\n\nWhen desire dies, fear is born.\n\nOf course I'm doing something about my overdraft: I'm seeing my accountant.\n\nLanguage is an archeological vehicle... the language we speak is a whole palimpsest of human effort and history.\n\nAcceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.\n\n\n"}
