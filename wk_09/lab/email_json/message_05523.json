Thoughts?\n\ni know. as soon as we consider live-helper (which is rotting in NEW) as\nready, i'll coordinate this. ETA is about 2 to 4 weeks from now.\n\n> Btw, what's the needed work to integrate d-i gtk and/or ubiquity in\n> the live desktop images for Lenny ?\n\nd-i and g-i on the same images, in terms of seperate boot option are\nready soon. in terms of 'launch d-i/g-i from a booted live-system as an\napplication', this requires, as far as i'm told, that the d-i people\nprovides special builds for that purpose.\n\nfor the 'live-to-hdd' installation, we will most likely write something\non your own. plan is to have it done until mid of july.\n\nand well, lenny is far, far away...\n\n> In other words\n> they can boot the live desktop image and install a dns server through\n> its task.\n\ni don't understand what you mean here.\n\n-- \nAddress:        Daniel Baumann, Burgunderstrasse 3, CH-4562 Biberist\nEmail:          daniel.baumann@panthera-systems.net\nInternet:       http://people.panthera-systems.net/~daniel-baumann/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
