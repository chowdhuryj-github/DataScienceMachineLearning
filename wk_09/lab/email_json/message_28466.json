What is \nthe bigmem kernel used for as opposed to the i686 kernel?  Also, I think I \nfound me a better firewall program available in both debian and slackware \nand maybe elsewhere too.  It's more involved getting set up than lockkit \nand can be adjusted using speakup.  The package is called \narno-iptables-firewall.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
