The company's\u00a0 \n\t\tBrazeau River project in Alberta currently has 2 producing wells.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMr. Jim \n\t\t\tBreimayer reports:\u00a0\n\nDaytona Energy Corp. has successfully \n\t\t\tcompleted stimulation of the Gething interval in the Brazeau River \n\t\t\t2-5-48-14 W5M well located in west-central Alberta.\n\nAccording to Daytona's chief executive \n\t\t\tofficer, Jim Breimayer: \"While it is too early to quantify reserve \n\t\t\tadditions, we are encouraged by the significant increase in flow \n\t\t\trate from this stimulation and the low-cost reserves that may have \n\t\t\tbeen added. We are also excited about the implications it may have \n\t\t\tfor further low-risk development drilling on this unit. This well is \n\t\t\tthe only well on its 640-acre unit and may have development drilling \n\t\t\tpotential as well.\"\n\nPrior to the stimulation, the well was \n\t\t\tproducing 200 to 300 thousand cubic feet per day. After the \n\t\t\tstimulation, the well has flowed at rates as high as 1.4 million \n\t\t\tcubic feet per day. This well was originally completed in January, \n\t\t\t2005, and had produced over 400 million cubic feet of reserves prior \n\t\t\tto the stimulation. Daytona owns a 6-per-cent working interest in \n\t\t\tthe well and in the 640-acre unit it holds. \n\n\nIn addition, the Alberta Energy Utilities \n\t\t\tBoard has recently approved the downspacing of the Gething formation \n\t\t\tin this area from 640 acres per well to 320 acres per well. This may \n\t\t\tprovide additional drilling within Section 5-48-14 W5M and Section \n\t\t\t32-47-14 W5M where Daytona also has 6-per-cent working interest.\n\t\t\t\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nCommon Shares lssued - 34 million\n\t\tMarket Capitalization - $5.1 million\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\thttp://marketsmart.ca/docs/daytona_v3.pdf\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nPlease visit the \nDaytona Energy Corporation\u00a0 \n\t\t(DTE:TSX.V) website:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nhttp://www.daytonaenergy.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further \n\t\tinformation please call Marketsmart \n\t\tCommunications Inc.\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMarketSmart \n\t\t\tCommunications Inc.\n\n\nwww.marketsmart.ca\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nMaria Da Silva\n\n\nAdrian Sydenham\n\n\nJustin Martin\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n877 261 4466\n\n604 261 4466\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\t\t\tMarketSmart Communications Inc,.
