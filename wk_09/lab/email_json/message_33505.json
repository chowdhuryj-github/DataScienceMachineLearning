Making it the other way around, i.e. a list of \nmatrices, is much cleaner. You can then access the individual matrices \nusing '[[', e.g. F[[23]]. I don't know why (if even) you need the \nmatrix-like indexing but if you really do, you can create an array of \nindeces like this:\n\nind.arr <- matrix(1:25, ncol=5, byrow=TRUE)\nF[[(ind.arr[5,3])]]#is the same as F[[23]] above if F-matrix were 5x5.\n\nPetr\n\n> \n> Any suggestions?\n> \n> -Scott\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n\n-- \nPetr Klasterecky\nDept. of Probability and Statistics\nCharles University in Prague\nCzech Republic\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
