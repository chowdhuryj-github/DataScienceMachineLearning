As an example say,\ni have the data frame with column names\n\nvar1  var2  Unit  time  trt\n\n(trt represents the treatment)\n\n Now suppose I want to fit a joint model of the form for the *i* th unit\n var1jk = alpha1 + beta1*timejk  + gamma1* trtjk + delta1* timejk:trtjk +\nerror1jk\n\n var2 = alpha2 + beta2*timejk  + gamma2* trtjk + delta2* timejk:trtjk +\nerror2jk\n\nwhere j index time and k index the treatment received\n\nUsing indicator variables I have been able to fit and run the code for\na bivariate model using unstructured covariance matrix. However,\nI want to fit a model for a structured variance covariance matrix.\nThe error structure for the grouping unit is as follows\n\nsigma = ( sigma1      sigma12 )\n             ( sigma12       sigma2)\n\nsigma1, sigma2 and sigma12 are matrices with\nwhere\nsigma1 = sig1 * AR1(rho1)\nsigma2 = sig2* AR1(rho2)\nsigma12 = sig12 * AR1(rho12)\n\nMy question is whether there is any method to fit such data using\npackages like gee or geepack (or may be any other package ) in R.  The\nfunction  genZcor() of geepack can be used to construct correlation but\nI have been unable to use it in the present context.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards\nSouvik Banerjee\nLecturer\nDepartment of statistics\nMemari College\nBurdwan\nIndia\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
