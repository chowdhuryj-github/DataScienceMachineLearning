You should put the\nfile elsewhere or change the Apache config so that it determines file-\ntype by examining suffixes. (How you do this is an Apache issue -\nnothing to do with Perl).\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
