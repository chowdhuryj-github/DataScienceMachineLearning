One could roughly say that it is a \ncollection of (quite similiar) time series. This makes the analysis better \nthan pooling the whole set but it needs certain econometric tools. \n\nAn example would be estimating wage elasticities.\n\nTime series analysis usually just involves one subject (interest rates, share \nprices etc.) over some time.\n\nStandard books on panel data analysis are also Baltagi: econometric analysis \nof panel data and Wooldridge: econometric analysis of cross sectional and \npanel data. Both are not introductionary texts since you do not know the \ndifference between time series and panel data maybe you should start with an \nintroductionary econometrics book like Wooldridge introductory econometrics \nor Verbeek: modern econometrics.\n\nStefan\n\non Thursday 14 June 2007 07:33:05 Megh Dal wrote:\nMD > Then what is the difference between panel data and time series data? You\n said panel data is data on \"same subject being tracked over time\". But time\n series data also do the same. Please correct me if I am wrong.
