The authors are extremely clear in\ntheir writing and the paper is quite an eye opener for me but it seems\nlike lfun somehow needs to be initialized so that it \"grabs\" the\nenvironment of \"Rmklike\". \nI'm not sure how one would go about doing this so I am wondering what\nthe main program that calls \"newton\" would be\nif there was one.
