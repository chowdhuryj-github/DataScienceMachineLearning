Does grml full version 1.0 support dectalk \nexpress or is anyone else successfully using a dectalk express with 2.6.20.x \nkernels?  Is there any plans for debian systems to use 2.6.20 as now speakup \ndebian is still on 2.6.18 and gcc and other programs needed to compile a new \nkernel are not installed on my system and I don't know all of their names to \ngive apt-get. \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
