Getting the fw files in place \nwas all it needed. The ipw2200 was in my install.  So all was in place \nand upon rebooting it showed that I had an active wireless connection.  \nThen came the process of getting wpa_supplicant up as I run WPA-PSK TKIP \nsecurity.  I really complicated that as it was one of the modules in the \n\"etch\" install.  I heard about supplicant from a local linux user and \nhad downloaded the tarball for 0.5.7. I proceeded to try to install it \nbefore I finally did some checking and discovered that the preloaded \nversion was 0.5.5.  After removing 0.5.7, shutting down and removing my \nnetwork cable, I restarted and the supplicant gui came up asking for my \npassword. Entered and voila.  Connected like a champ. \nDid a restart and it loaded in startup asking me for the password once \nI'd logged on to the system.\nSo I'm a happy geriatric camper this afternoon.\nThanks for your replies.\n\nJim\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
