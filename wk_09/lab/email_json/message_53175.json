You will have to determine a way to test a user\nresponse to a prompt. In the course of writing tests, you should try\nto resolve RT 43172.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
