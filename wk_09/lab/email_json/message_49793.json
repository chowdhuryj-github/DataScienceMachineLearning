If you are using a kernel that came with your distribution,\nthen chances are good that most, if not all of the support for your\nhardware is built as modules, and isn't statically built into the kernel.\n\n> There is usually huge sections of the kernel that you don't\n> need on a PC, for example, I have an IDE controller so\n> I don't need SCSI, I only need SCSI emulation to support\n> CD burning, so I exlude most of SCSI.\n\nActually, if you have an ide burner, and are running a 2.6.x kernel,\nthen you don't need ide-scsi emulation for cd burning either.\n\nGreg\n\n\n- -- \nweb site: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org\ngpg public key: http://www.romuald.net.eu.org/pubkey.asc\nskype: gregn1\n(authorization required, add me to your contacts list first)\n\n- --\nFree domains: http://www.eu.org/ or mail dns-manager@EU.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGdeuF7s9z/XlyUyARAmfIAJ0cHghg5MyNX6e4mh/ArC7o2zQleACfR49B\npvc6e3e5lN2kmga9mkCZmEU=\n=1FOv\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
