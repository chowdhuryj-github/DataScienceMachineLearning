Those \nassumptions are clearly violated for binary data. \n\n      RSiteSearch(\"PCA for binary data\") produced references to 'ade4' \nand 'FactoMineR'.  Have you considered these?  I have not used them, but \nFactoMineR included functions for 'Multiple Factor Analysis for Mixed \n[quantitative and qualitative] Data'\n  \n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n\nJosh Gilbert wrote:\n> I don't understand, what's wrong with using prcomp in this situation?\n>\n> On Sunday 10 June 2007 12:50 pm, Ranga Chandra Gudivada wrote:\n>   \n>> Hi,\n>>\n>>     I was wondering whether there is any package implementing Principal\n>> Component Analysis for Binary data\n>>\n>>                                               Thanks chandra\n>>\n>>\n>> ---------------------------------\n>>\n>>\n>> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n>> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal,\n>> self-contained, reproducible code.\n>>     \n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
