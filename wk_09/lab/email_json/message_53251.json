You need to get the ttsynth say and speakup \nconnector source code from he ttsynth.com website. When I last looked, \nthese could be downloaded from the main page.\n\n> So did I get a partial download or do I misunderstand something.\n\nNo, sounds like the download was in fact complete. if the download was \nincomplete, the rpm command would have likely failed.\n\nAlso note that you will need the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 shared library \npresent on your system to make use of ttsynth.\n- -- \nLuke Yelavich\nGPG key: 0xD06320CE \n\t (http://www.themuso.com/themuso-gpg-key.txt)\nEmail & MSN: themuso@themuso.com\nJabber: themuso@jabber.org.au\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFGfJWMjVefwtBjIM4RArbpAJ40EXM/GttDK5Uif02ajRsSePpKpQCg6R+X\nzZLcnb9iCEX19x8r+z0SrCE=\n=D5KP\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
