What exactly is the difference between doing a\ntwo-factor repeated measures ANOVA and a Hotelling T-squared test for a\npaired comparison of mean vectors?\n\nGiven:\n\nAnova: repeated measures on both factors, 1st factor = two different\ntreatments, 2nd factor = 4 time points, where you are measuring the\nblood pressure at each of the time points.\n\nHotelling T^2: You look at the difference in the 4x1 vector of blood\npressure measurements for the two different treatments, where the four\nrows in the vector are the four time points.\n\n\nI am mainly interested in the main effects of the two treatments.  Can\nsomeone please explain if there would be a difference in the two methods\nor any advantage in using one over the other?\n\nThanks,\nSean\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
