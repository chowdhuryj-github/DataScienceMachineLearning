A new [1]industry-backed 'Copyright Alliance' was formed in the\ncity of Washington, DC. Tasked with the nebulous goal of 'promoting the\nvalue of copyright as an agent for creativity, jobs, and growth', the\nultimate goal of the organization is to strengthen copyright laws\noverall. \"Backed by organizations like the MPAA, NBC, News Corp., Disney,\nTime Warner, the Business Software Alliance, Microsoft, ASCAP, the NBA,\nand others, the Copyright Alliance has already secured initial support\nfrom several members of Congress ... The group is headed by Patrick Ross,\na former senior fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, a strongly\nfree-market think tank. Ross has written about IP issues for years, and\nin a 2005 opinion piece claimed that he was 'looking for anyone who wants\nto join me in seeking that elusive middle ground.' His new gig may be a\nstrange place to fight for that 'middle ground' in any meaningful sense,\nas the Alliance is dedicated to 'strengthening copyright law' using\n'bilateral, regional, and multilateral agreements to protect creators'\nand advancing educational programs 'that teach the value of strong\ncopyright.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/25/1255202\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.myspace.com/jombeewoof\n    1. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070518-new-copyright-alliance-hopes-to-strengthen-copyright-law.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Sony Sued for Blu-Ray Patent Violation                             |\n|   from the how-shiny-is-too-shiny dept.                            |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday May 25, @10:23 (Sony)                   |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/25/1344249          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nJaidan writes \"According to a Gamespot article, a California-based\ncompany named Target Technology is [0]suing Sony over patents it\nallegedly holds for silver based reflective surfaces.

Quoting the press release: ' The conclusions of the court\ncan be applied all over Europe since the word effective comes directly\nfrom the directive ... A protection measure is no longer effective, when\nthere is widely available end-user software implementing a circumvention\nmethod. My understanding is that this is not technology-dependent.

'The\ndisplay combines Sony's organic thin film transistor, or TFT, technology,\nwhich is required to make flexible displays, with another kind of\ntechnology called organic electroluminescent display, it said. The latter\ntechnology is not as widespread for gadgets as the two main display\ntechnologies now on the market - liquid crystal displays and plasma\ndisplay panels.
