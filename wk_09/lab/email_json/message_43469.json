They give us options in case a\nsubsystem has a security hole, and we can then say in an advisory\n\"here is the simple workaround, add this to smb.conf\". It would mean\nsome work for admins (moving their groups back to the tdb, which is\nnot automated) but its doable.\n\nI don't actually expect this will be needed as I am very confident of\nthis code, I just don't see the harm in keeping options open.\n\nIt can also have unexpected benefits. For example, Volker just pointed\nout that ldb doesn't obey the \"use mmap\" option for it's underlying\ntdb files. I will fix that tonight, but if we had discovered this\nafter the release then we might have had to do a new release just to\nwork around the broken mmap in HPUX, whereas otherwise we can get a\nfew days grace by announcing to the mailing lists that HPUX users\nshould set the option to use tdb based group mapping.\n\nSo I would prefer to keep this sort of option in, but I won't complain\nloudly if you take it out.\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
