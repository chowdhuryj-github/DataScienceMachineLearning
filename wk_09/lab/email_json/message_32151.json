This is somewhat fixed in cvs, but I suppose the grml people don't have a recent cvs snapshot \nof speakup.  Perhaps we should inform them to check out speakup.  Even so, getting dectalk to speak still sometime \nrequires some effort.  If it doesn't speak on boot, we occasionally have to type\necho dectlk > /proc/speakup/synth_name\n twice in order to get speech.\n\nHope this helps.\nJosh\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
