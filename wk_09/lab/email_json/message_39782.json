(That is what\nDebian would be distributing,\nmost likely, as Debian packages often include patches against the source\ncode).\n\nIt would be nice if this would be expanded to include all derivitves of FoF.\nHowever, even just expansion to include all derivitives of FoF that retain\nthe same game style\n(that is to say are still Guitar Hero clones), would be an improvment.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
