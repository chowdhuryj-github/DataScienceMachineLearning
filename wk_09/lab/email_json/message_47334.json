I believe that 64\nStudio does plan to  go to a commercial support business model at some\npoint (I don't think they have money now) and of course, Canonical still\nhas capital. I don't see that being anywhere near as easy, but it might\nwork.\n\nCheers,\nTerry\n\n-- \nTerry Hancock (hancock@AnansiSpaceworks.com)\nAnansi Spaceworks http://www.AnansiSpaceworks.com\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
