You can not tell certain threads to run on certain \ncores without modifying the code itself. Also the problems with \nspeechdup/speech dispatcher on multi-core systems relate to the fact that \nmultiple threads run concurrently rather than running in a pre-emptive \nmanner.\nThat is to say on a single core only one process runs at a time; with each \nprocess scheduled into running one after the other.\n\nThe code in speechdup/speech dispatcher needs to be rewritten to take into \naccount the possibility of multiple threads running at once, and your only \nsolution to running this stabily on your system is to disable your second \ncore or run and test cvs code.\nWithout testers it will take far longer to debug these problems; and unless \nyou are willing to run a single core you sacrifice stability regardless of \nwhether the code is cvs or not.\ncvs is not difficult to use; and you simply check out a source tree which \nyou then build.\n\nIf you are not used to building from source; perhaps it is necessary to wait \nfor the next stable release of these tools that will be stable and aware of \nsmp systems.\n\nRegards, Kerry.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Keith Hinton\" \nTo: \nSent: Sunday, June 24, 2007 6:10 PM\nSubject: Assistance with a dual-core machine.\n\n\n> Hello all on the ilst,\n> At this time, (although) I am sure that CVS SpeechD-up/Dispatcher sounds \n> great, I do not wish to test it..and \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
