I \nresample the data 10,000 times, each time extracting the regression \ncoefficients. At present I extract the individual regression \ncoefficients using\n\n  brg = lm(Newdv~Teach + Exam + Knowledge + Grade + Enroll)\n  bcoef[i,] = brg$coef\n\nThis works fine.\n\nBut now I want to extract the t tests on these coefficients. I cannot \nfind how these coefficients are stored, if at all. When I try\n    attributes(brg)\nI do not find the t values as the attributes of the object. Typing \nsummary(brg) will PRINT the coefficients, their standard errors, t, and \nthe associated probability. I would like to type something like\n    tcoeff[i,] = brg$tvalue\nbut, of course, tvalue doesn't exist.\n\nIs there a simple way to extract, or compute if necessary, these values?\n\nThanks,\nDave Howell\n\n\n\n-- \nDavid C.
