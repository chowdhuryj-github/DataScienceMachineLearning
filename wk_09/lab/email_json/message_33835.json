I found several PLS algorithms in R (NIPALS,SIMPLS,KERNEL PLS).  SAS has SIMPLS and NIPALS.\n   \n  The following are the NIPALS calculations of the regression coefficients for the above data using 2 principal components:\n   \n  Using R:\n   \n  x1  0.4002324\nx2 -0.2679829\nx3  0.5684680\n\n   \n  Using SAS:\n   \n  x1 0.4671608452\n  x2 -.1537662492\n  x3 0.6090024992\n   \n  Why is the discrepancy very large?  I observed that SAS and Minitab have the same output, but the R output is very different. Using the SIMPLS algorithm also produced R and SAS outputs that are different.\n   \n  Any clarification on this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n   \n  Sincerely,\n  Kyle Rogers\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n    \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBuilding a website is a piece of cake. \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
