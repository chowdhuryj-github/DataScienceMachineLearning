I hope I was clear enough.\n\nI guess that the 'names' are or could be represented by a 'factor' much \nlike the variable 'state' in the 'specific example' in\n\n \t'An Introduction to R' Section 4\n\nIf the 'manual' have consulted was not 'An Introduction...', do as the \n__posting guide__ suggests:\n\n \t\"Read at least the relevant section in An Introduction to R\"\n\nIf that section (and the rest of 'An Intro...' for that matter) and the \nhelp pages for the functions mentioned there do not answer your question, \nit would probably help elicit a useful response to spell out how your \nproblem differs from those addressed therein.\n\n\n[rest deleted]\n\nCharles C.
