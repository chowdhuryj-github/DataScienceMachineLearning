There are no comparable classes in base R, but there are \nin some of the addon packages - fCalendar has already been mentioned and \nthere are others (see the CRAN Econometric task view).\n\nwindow, ts.union and ts.intersect have done all the alignment on regular \ntime series (class \"ts\") I have ever needed.\n\n>\n> Martin\n>\n>\n>>>>>> \"ML\" == Markus Loecher \n>>>>>>     on Thu, 28 Jun 2007 11:10:51 -0400 writes:\n>\n>    ML> Dear list members, I switched from Splus to R a few\n>    ML> years ago and so far found no functionality missing.\n>    ML> However, I am struggling to find the equivalent align()\n>    ML> function for time series.
