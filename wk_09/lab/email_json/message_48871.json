This looks useful, as far as it goes.\n\nHowever, it doesn't deal directly with PS, so one\nwould have to work to pixel resolution of screenshots\nas displayed by say 'gv'.\n\nIn the case of an example such as the Fig 4 I mentioned\nin a previous post, this would involve taking several\nscreenshots to \"tile\" over the entirety of the graph,\nsince the pixel accuracy or a screenshot of the entire\ngraph would be rather poor.\n\nThis would introduce the neccessity of keeing track of\npoints from screenshot to screenshot, and also each\nscreenshot would have its own coordinate system so these\nwould have to be reconciled before the final dataset\ncould be compiled.\n\nBut thanks -- this could well be worth a try in a different\nkind of context (e.g. I have some screenshots of old maps\nwhich I want to digitise ... ).\n\nBest wishes,\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 16-Jun-07                                       Time: 01:13:53\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
