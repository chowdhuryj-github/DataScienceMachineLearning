However, \nparsimonious correlation had heterscedasticity models would likely be \nwise.  Years ago, George Box expressed concern about people worrying too \nmuch about outliers, which are often fairly obvious and relatively easy \nto detect, while they worried too little, he thought, about dependence, \nespecially serial dependence, which is generally more difficult to \ndetect and creates bigger problems in inference than outliers.  He \nwrote, \"Why worry about mice when there are tigers about?\" \n\nSG:  Issues of this type can be fairly easily evaluated using \n'simulate.lme'. \n\n      Hope this helps. \n      Spencer Graves\n> Thanks,\n> Shirley\n>\n> On 6/27/07, Simon Blomberg  wrote:\n>   \n>> The default settings for lme do assume equal variances within groups.\n>> You can change that by using the various varClasses. see ?varClasses.
