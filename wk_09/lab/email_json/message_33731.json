This is because R does not make the same kind of distinction between variables read from data files and those created by programming statements.  R is not SAS and you will be most successful using R if you don't try to force SAS solutions into it.\n\nIf you could give an example of some R code that you think requires the equivalent of RETAIN, I am sure someone on the list will be able to help with an appropriate R solution.\n\nDan\n\nDaniel Nordlund\nBothell, WA USA\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
