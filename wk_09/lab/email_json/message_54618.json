The help indicates that it accepts a matrix\nof pair-wise linkage disequilibrium measures, one of which is R^2 (the\ncorrelation coefficient between loci), but I suspect you could simply\npass it a matrix of correlation coefficents.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nNeil\n-- \n\"In mathematics you don't understand things.
