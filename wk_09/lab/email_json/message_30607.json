We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your \naccount. We requested information from you for the following reason:\n\n            Our system   requires further account \nverification.\nTo restore your account,   \nplease Sign \nin to Online Banking.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for using Bank Of America Online \nService. \n\n\nYour account   might be placed on \nrestricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive   payments, \nbut they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds. To   \nlift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your   \nusername or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our \nverification   process. You must confirm your credit card details and your \nbilling information as well. All restricted accounts have their billing \ninformation unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from \nyour account until you have reactived your billing information on file. \nSign in to Online Banking \n            Thank You. \n\nPlease do not reply to   this message. \nIf you have any questions about the information in this e-Bill,   \nplease contact your biller.
