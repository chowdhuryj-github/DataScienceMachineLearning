Is there an easy way to install (or load, if that's the easier way) those packages under 2.5.0, without having to install each package by hand?\n\nThis was just discussed in another thread but batchfiles on CRAN (which is\na collection of Windows XP batch files, not an R package) contains\nmovedir.bat and copydir.bat that will move or copy your packages from\none version of R to another.  See the home page:\n\n   http://code.google.com/p/batchfiles/\n\nwhich gives links to the README where its explained and to the CRAN\ndownload area from where you can download it.\n\nmovedir.bat is very fast (only a few seconds) but your packages will then\nonly reside in the new version of R.  copydir.bat is slower but makes\ncopies rather than moving the packages.  Neither will overwrite anything\nso they are both pretty safe to use.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
