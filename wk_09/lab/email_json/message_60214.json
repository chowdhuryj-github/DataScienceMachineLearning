We do this using Exceed and PUTTY settings, \nbut your sysadmins will be able to help you: it is not a question about\nR \nper se.\n\nOn Mon, 2 Jul 2007, zhihua li wrote:\n\n> Hi netters,\n>\n> Now I'm connecting from my local windows machine to a remote linux\nmachine \n> and launch R out there using SSH.
