Interestingly, the later can link to R for  \ngraphical output and some analyses (like GAM) (i.e. Brodgar produces  \nR scripts from choices users make in their GUI and sends them to R).\n\nI would prefer to do the time series analysis in R. As there is no  \nMac version of Brodgar, I have even more incentive to do MAFA and DFA  \nin R.\n\nDoes anyone know of a package to do such analyses? Maybe other names  \nare used for these techniques, which would explain why I always end  \nup at Brodgar when searching for MAFA?\n\nOr maybe someone has written his/her own functions for such analyses  \nand would agree to share them?\n\nSincerely,\n\nDenis Chabot\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
