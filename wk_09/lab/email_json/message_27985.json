The problem is that we can't use it to deal with a linear model with\nmore than one predictor variable. But the usage documentation\nhasn't informed us about this.\n\nYou can find it by excuting the following code:\n\nxx=matrix(rnorm(20*3),ncol=3)\nbb=c(1,2,0)\nyy=xx%*%bb+rnorm(20,0,10)\n\ndata=data.frame(y=yy,x=xx)\nmyformula=formula(\"y ~ x.1 + x.2 + x.3\")\ncv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)\nmyformula=formula(\"y ~ x.1 + x.2\")\ncv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)\nmyformula=formula(\"y ~ x.1 \")\ncv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)\n\nWhat happened? they give three equal mss(mean squared error).\nOr you can just check the code of function cv.lm(DAAG), then you will find\nthe residues are all derived from a model with only one predictor, but the\ncoefficient of that only one predictor can be calculated from a model with\nmore than one predictors which you've set in the formula term in cv.lm(DAAG),\n\n\n-- \nJunjie Li,                  klijunjie@gmail.com\nUndergranduate in DEP of Tsinghua University,\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
