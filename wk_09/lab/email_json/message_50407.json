In Matlab, this amounts to:\n\n[my.solution] = solve('x = z*(1-(1-2/z)^y') \nmy.solution.real = solution(y-1,y)\n\n% bottom line displays non-imaginary solution (last element)\n\nObviously, I'm deeply unqualified as a mathematician or programmer and \nregret wasting your time if this question is really basic. I would very \nmuch appreciate even the smallest morsel of time that you might spend on \nthis, and yes, you could be my hero.\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nBoris\n\nP.S.
