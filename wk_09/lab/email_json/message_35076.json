If a domain name contains non-ASCII characters, it\nmust be normalized to the NFKC form. Order assertions specify the order\nin which the given locks must be acquired. Characters are decomposed by\ncompatibility equivalence then recomposed by canonical equivalence. The\nmethod returns a non-zero result when errors occur.\nTim Bray, co-creator of XML, talks about the significance of Sun's open\nsource efforts     DON'T MISS THIS!\nAnnotations provide a good way to document your program.\nBecause the characters are  visually distinguishable and have additional\nsemantic information, the characters are not canonically equivalent.\nNote - These specifications may also be conveyed using source code\nannotations. Remember that you cannot run analyze twice for a given\nstate, so it will probably help to save the state of LockLint using the\nsave subcommand before running analyze.\nIt's almost too easy.\nTo print out existing constraints, use the reallows and disallows\nsubcommands. The LockLint database for each source file is stored in a\nseparate file.\n\n"}
