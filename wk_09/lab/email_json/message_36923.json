Go into xorg.conf ( or which config file\nyou have), edit Section \"Module\", add a hash '#' before the line \"Load\nglx\" \", like this\n/*********************\nSection \"Module\"\n[snip]\n# Load \t\"glx\"\n# Load\t\"dri\"\t/* as well as dri */\n[/snip]\n*********************/\n\nAnd you must comment the whole of Section \"DRI\", like this\n\n#Section \"DRI\"\n#\tMode\t0666\n#EndSection\n\nTry it!\n\nNickel Cobalt\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
