The new tests \ndon't require any YAML support either.\n\nSpecial thanks to \u00c6var Arnfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Bjarmason for thoroughly investigating the \nprevious problems with the test suite, and to Matthew Wilson for SVNing the \nprevious version and offering to tackle the testing problems.\n\nDamian\n\n"}
