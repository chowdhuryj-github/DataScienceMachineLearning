Where is the logic in all of this?\n\nTomorrow I will be defending myself (again) in the High Court, London,\nagainst claims of slander brought on by the convicted and notorious Aboutaam\nbrothers, Ali and Hicham, formerly and presently on the radar of several law\nenforcement agencies. \n\nA long list of witnesses including: Cambridge-McDonald-Institute\narchaeologist Dr. Neil Brodie... Founder and former head of New Scotland\nYard Art and Antique Squad Richard Ellis... Colonel Matthew Bogdanos...\nFormer head (recently sadly deceased) of Mossad Hesi Carmel, all provided\nstatements towards my defence and credibility and the scandalous track\nrecord in the artworld of the Aboutaams.\n\nThe only witnesses the Aboutaam Brothers provided to the court where\nthemselves.\n\nMay I ask you politely to share the Interpol details with your readers, of\nwhich I know that many are active in law enforcement. ?\n\n----------------- ?\n\nINTERPOL FILE: RED ALERT Ali ABOUTAAM\n\nA/1138/5/2007\n\nIssued: 25/5/07\n\nFile number 25913/2007\n-----------------------\n\nThank you,\n\nMichel van Rijn\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nMSN-list mailing list\nMSN-list@te.verweg.com\nhttp://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list\n\n\nEnd of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 145\n****************************************\n\n"}
