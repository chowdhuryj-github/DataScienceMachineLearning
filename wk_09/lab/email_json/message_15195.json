I\ncan deal with this by modifying the hist object before plotting it\n(x$density[x$density == 0] <- NA), but I'm sure I've seen a more elegant\nway. Perhaps this was in truehist (MASS). I have looked but can't find it.\nDoes anyone know?\n\nBest wishes\n\nPaul\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/omit-y%3Dzero-line-in-histogram-tf3643983.html#a10176762\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
