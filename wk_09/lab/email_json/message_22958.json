{"category": "ham", "to_address": "\"Duncan Murdoch\" <murdoch@stats.uwo.ca>", "from_address": "\"Doran, Harold\" <HDoran@air.org>", "subject": "Re: [R] R package development in windows", "body": "OK, so I just want to go on record as noting that following the\ninstructions exactly (exactly, exactly, exactly, emphatically) on the\nweb given by Duncan, Gabor, and Tony at the page below, and following\nthe instructions in Writing R Extensions results in a successful Windows\nbuild of a package.\n\nShould this email turn up in someones search using RSiteSearch() or\nelsewhere, my best advice is to ignore all other documents on the web\nattempting to explain this. I personally went through 4 or 5 different\npersonal web sites looking for a straightforward guide. After a week or\nso of late night reading and experimentation, all of those documents led\nme to a path of failure. After reading the info on the link below, and\nthen referring back to Writing R Extensions, I was able to build the\npackage in only a few hours of time. It took significantly less time to\nread the manual and information on the link below than it did to google\nhelp pages on the topic, read those, and end up even more confused.\n\nI'm not in the best position to offer specific recommendations on how to\nimprove this process. The reality is that after collecting all programs\nrequired, making the required changes to the path, the Rcmd commands for\nthe build are very simple. So, the biggest task is the collection of\nessential programs and modification to the path.\n\nObviously, Rtools is designed to move forward in this direction. Its\ncurrent phase still doesn't automate that collection and modification\nprocess entirely, and the reasons are given on Duncan's web site.\nHowever, I suppose the only good recommendation I can make at this point\nis to still move forward with Rtools such that it installs all required\nprograms and automatically updates the path accordingly. Maybe this can\neven become part of the base installation. Since the open source nature\nof R encourages development, the tools needed for development should be\nreadily available.\n\nI am certain this recommendation is not novel, and Duncan et al have\nalready thought of this. But, it's my attempt to do a little better than\ncomplain.\n\nThe only other piece of advice I can offer is to keep this stable. That\nis, when R 2.5.1 et seq are released, I beg of the developers not to\nrequire a new collection of tools or a different set up than what is\nalready required. It is a bit of work, and if changes are required at\neach R release, this may be too disheartening.\n\nHarold\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Duncan Murdoch [mailto:murdoch@stats.uwo.ca] \n> Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2007 3:51 PM\n> To: Doran, Harold\n> Cc: Gabor Grothendieck; r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [SPAM] - Re: [SPAM] - Re: [R] R package development \n> in windows - Bayesian Filter detected spam - Bayesian Filter \n> detected spam\n> \n> On 5/3/2007 3:33 PM, Doran, Harold wrote:\n> > Thanks, Duncan.
