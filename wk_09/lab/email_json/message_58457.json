The plot's rotation has been set to clearly show the \nresponse surface generated in GAM.  The resulting plot is small enough \nthat the tick labels overlap tick marks, start in the plot, and overlap \neach other.  I could reduce the font size using cex, however, doing so \nwould make it too small for the manuscript.  Using adj in par( ) does \nnot change anything in the plot.gam( ) function, only the text( ) \nfunction.  The tick labels on the x-axis need adjustment to the right \nand those on the y-axis need adjustment to the left.\n \nHere is the code:\n\nlibrary(mgcv)\ngam.from.mgcv<-gam(response ~ s(var1) + s(var2, var3) + s(var4) + \noffset(var5),\n    family=poisson, scale=-1, gamma=1.4, data=globecdata)\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\npar(cex=1, xpd=NA)\nplot(gam.from.mgcv, select=2, pers=T, theta=-65, phi=20, scale=0,\n      xlab=\"\\n\\n\\nLongitude\", ylab=\"\\n\\nLatitude\", main=\"\",\n      ticktype=\"detailed\", expand=0.8)\npar(srt=100, adj=0.5)  #angle and alignment to set for z label\ntext(-0.5,-0.06,\"Effect\\n\\n\")  #x,y coordinates to place z label\n \nHow do I adjust the tick labels?\n \nAlso, I would like to remove the negative signs from the tick labels on \nthe x-axis for longitude.  Is there a way to use the abs( ) function for \nthis?\n \nThanks,\nSuzan\n\n-- \nSuzan Pool\nOregon State University\nCooperative Institute for Marine Resources Studies\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
