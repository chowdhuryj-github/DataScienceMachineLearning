What I was trying to do is to\nturn my matrix or frame containing index level returns and stock returns\ninto a matrix of \"betas\".  I don't really need to worry about risk-free\ninterest rates.  I just need to be able to come up with a number that shows\nthe expected index correlation.  \n\n \n\nI was able finally to figure out how to use cor() to get what I think is an\nR^2 value.  But, I'm trying to also figure out the ratio of correlation.\nFor example, some stocks correlate very well and cor() returns a value of\n.92.  But, how do you then figure out if the stock should have a 1.5:1\ncorrelation? \n\n \n\nThe way I would do it by hand is to turn the closes into daily returns and\nthen get the mean() return for each stock against the index by day.  I can't\nfind an example as hard as I look, but this must be very common.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nJosh\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
