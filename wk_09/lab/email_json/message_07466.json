More generally\nrownames(A) <- 1:length(A[,1])\n\nAnd keep in mind that nobody is going to help you next time, if you \nwon't give a clear and informative SUBJECT in your message. Here it \nshould have been something like 'wrong row names in subset' or \n'dataframe subset question' etc, certainly not 'please help me, it's \ntrivial'...\n\nBtw, there is something like the posting guide for this list (see footer).\n\nPetr\n\n-- \nPetr Klasterecky\nDept. of Probability and Statistics\nCharles University in Prague\nCzech Republic\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
