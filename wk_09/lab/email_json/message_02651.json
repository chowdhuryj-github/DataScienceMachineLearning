The algorithm used in lme doesn't perform well in this\nsituation which is one reason that the lmer and lmer2 functions in the\nlme4 package were created.  Could you try fitting the model with those\nor provide us with the data so we can check it out?\n\nI recommend moving this discussion to the R-SIG-mixed-models mailing\nlist which I am copying on this reply.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
