This is primarily meant for creating tutorials, but you could  \nas well tell stories with it.\n\n> My parents read to me when I was little; let them read to each other,\n> not only read at by a distant stranger (or a speech synthesis  \n> algorithm).\n\nThere also is a Klatt-style speech synthesizer for Squeak, with  \nmatching facial animation of cartoon figures. Very entertaining, but  \nI wouldn't have any kid learn English from that ;)\n\n- Bert -\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
