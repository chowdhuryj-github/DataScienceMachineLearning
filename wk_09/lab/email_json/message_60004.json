That's what Inside is for:\n\n  http://search.cpan.org/~phoenix/Inside-1.01/\n\n>  I tried perldoc -f param and got nothing.\n\nSince the function comes from the module, it's documented in the module:\n\n    perldoc CGI\n\n>       #!/usr/local/bin/perl\n>       use CGI ':standard';\n>       print \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\";\n>       $value = param('myvalue');\n>       print (\"The value = $value\");\n\nMaybe that code doesn't work for you because you're not printing HTML,\nlike your header claims you are. You could change the type in the\nheader to 'text/plain', or you could change the output section. Have\nyou tried running it from the command line? Doing that is described in\nthe CGI module's documentation.\n\nAlso, of course, the usual admonitions to 'use strict', 'use\nwarnings', and so on.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
