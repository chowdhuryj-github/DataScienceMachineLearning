Here were the steps I took.\n\n1.) Look at R help page ?tkgetOpenFile\n2.) Hmmm. Lots of functions, but little info. But wait, what's this?\n\nDetails:\n\n    [snip]\n\n     There are far too many of these commands to describe them and\n     their arguments in full.  Please refer to the Tcl/Tk documentation\n     for details. With a few exceptions, the pattern is that Tk\n     subcommands like 'pack configure' are converted to function names\n     like 'tkpack.configure', and Tcl subcommands are like\n     'tclfile.dir'.\n\n3.) Type tkgetOpenFile at R prompt.\n\n> tkgetOpenFile\nfunction (...) \ntcl(\"tk_getOpenFile\", ...)\n\n\n4.) Google tk_getOpenFile.\n5.) http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/getOpenFile.htm \n\nBest,\n\nJim\n\n\n-- \n\nJames W.
