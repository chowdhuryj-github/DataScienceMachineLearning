You cannot be running\n%ACTIVESTATEPERL%\\bin\\perl.exe from the \"cygwin environment\" as\n%ACTIVESTATEPERL% has no meaning to BASH (you would have to say\n$%ACTIVESTATEPERL).  It would have meaning to the Windows command line\nprogram (cmd.exe).  Also, cygwin does not use an environmental\nvariable ACTIVESTATEPERL, that belongs to ActiveState Perl which has\nnothing whatsoever to do with Cygwin.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
