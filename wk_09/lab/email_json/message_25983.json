Pick one:\n\n- The 'new' opcode can no longer lookup string class names by type \nnumber (eventually true).\n\n- The PDD 15 object implementation needs to register a type number for \nits classes (as a temporary measure to smooth over integration).\n\nI recommend the second option for now.\n\n> $P0 = get_class \"Classname\"\n> $P1 = $P0.'new'();\n\nThis will also work, and will provide more syntactic sugar than the \n'new' opcode (e.g. named parameters for the initializer).\n\nAllison\n\n"}
