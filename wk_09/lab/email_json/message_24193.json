I\u00b4ve downloaded the rpms for Xfe and Rox (two file managers i want to test), installed them, and they work just fine when i call them from console. Now i want to have an activity for them. \nBasically, i\u00b4ve copied the RGBPaint activity and modified it. The icon for the file manager appears on the activities frame, and if you click on it, it\u00b4ll launch the program. But with some issues... it seems that the program is running for one side, and the activity is running separately. In fact, the activity is just an empty window with its close button. The only way to focus on the program is by pressing alt+p, and if you close either the activity with the close button or the program (File-->Exit Xfe), the other won\u00b4t close. I\u00b4m having this problem with every program i want to install, including Opera with the instructions from \nwiki.laptop.org.I looked at the logs and i saw the same error messages, something to do with Dbus, i don\u00b4t remember right now the message, but it\u00b4s something like \"no process is responding to xxxxxx activity\".\nCan anyone tell me what i\u00b4m doing wrong? Or if there\u00b4s any good documentation on creating activities on sugar? Because i could only find a couple of tutorials, but they\u00b4re useless (the HelloWorld activity on wiki.laptop...it\n\u00b4s waaaaay too basic).Emiliano\n"}
