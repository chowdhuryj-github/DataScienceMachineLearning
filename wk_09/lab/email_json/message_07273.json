Check out:\nlive.gnome.org/Orca to get the scoop on how to obtain the ubuntu live \ncd.  \n\nGnome accessibility has been in the works for several years, and much \nhas been accomlished in terms of the underlying archetecture.  However, \nin my opinion the end user experience is still far short of MS windows \nwith a screen reader \nor the linux console apps.  On the other hand, the Orca team at Sun \nMicrosystems has been working hard to improve accessibility and the \nproduct is more stable than in the past.  My major complaint is poor \nresponsiveness.  When I'm using speakup, I get almost immediate feedback \nto keystrokes and commands. I can't say the same about orca.  \n\nBut, I urge you to try it out and make suggestions to the Orca team.\n\nChris\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
