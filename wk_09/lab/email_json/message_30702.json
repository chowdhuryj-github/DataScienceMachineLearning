They\ndon't meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines and therefore cannot be\nincluded in Debian.  Ubuntu has a looser set of rules and allows those\nbinary blobs to be shipped.  It is a simple matter to copy the\nfirmware into place if that is what you desire.  (I did.  I have the\nIntel wireless too.)\n\n> Im sure debian would shoot to the top of the list if a few more\n> things (like wireless) \"just worked\" like it does with my Kbuntu.\n> \n> Couldn't someone work on this problem for debian - or talk to the\n> ubuntu people to get a copy to be included in the next release and\n> apt sources?\n\nIt is a legal/philosophical thing and not a technical thing.  The\nproblem is not deducing how to make it work.  The problem is making a\nfree driver.\n\n> Somethings I don't mind figuring out and there is a great sense of\n> accomplishment; but getting wireless working is not one of them.\n\nPerhaps more clear instructions need to be posted...\n\nBob\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
