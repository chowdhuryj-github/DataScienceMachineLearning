Do you really think that excellent hearing is a requirement for \nappreciating Ae, but not Kate Bush's other albums?\n\nReally, my problem is that my tastes haven't matured all that much. I \nstill like to listen to noisy kids playing punk rock for their teenage \nfriends, or more sophisticated noise merchants, like ...And You Will \nKnow Us By The Trail of Dead.\n\nMy problem with the album is that it lacks energy. There may be some \npassion there, but it's too quietly expressed (if at all) for my tastes. \nAnd, the subject matter doesn't always work for me. I'm not interest in \nPi. Or washing machines. Maybe when I'm older....\n\n- Donny\n\n\n\n................................................................\n       Posted via TITANnews - Uncensored Newsgroups Access\n             >>>> at http://www.TitanNews.com <<<<\n-=Every Newsgroup - Anonymous, UNCENSORED, BROADBAND Downloads=-\n\n"}
