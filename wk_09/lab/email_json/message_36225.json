I shouldn't pay soooo much\nattntion on the normality tests, so it wouldn't matter which one/ones\nI use to report... but rather focus on issues such as the power of the\ntest...\n\nThanks again.\n\nOn 25/05/07, Lucke, Joseph F  wrote:\n>  Most standard tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, are fairly resistant to\n> non-normalilty for significance testing.
