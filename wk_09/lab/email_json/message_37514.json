And that makes the t-test NON-robust!\nIt's an easy exercise to see that  lim T-statistic ---> 1  when\none observation goes to infinity, i.e., the t-test will never\nreject when you have one extreme outlier; simple \"proof\" with R:\n\n> t.test(11:20)\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  c(11:20) \nt = 16.1892, df = 9, p-value = 5.805e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 \n95 percent confidence interval:\n 13.33415 17.66585 \nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n     15.5 \n\n##   ---> unknown mean highly significantly different from 0\n##   But\n\n> t.test(c(11:20, 1000))\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  c(11:20, 1000) \nt = 1.1731, df = 10, p-value = 0.2679\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 \n95 percent confidence interval:\n -94.42776 304.42776 \nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n      105 \n\n\n\n\n    LuckeJF> Testing for normality prior to choosing a test\n    LuckeJF> statistic is generally not a good idea.\n\nDefinitely.
