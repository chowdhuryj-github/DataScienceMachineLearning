I'm kind of new to perl, especially when\ndealing with hash references. I would like to iterate through the hash\nthat is created by the XMLIn function. Here is my code:\n    use Env qw(GMNHOME GMNSQLSRVR GVHOME);\n    use XML::Simple;\n    use Data::Dumper;\n    $ref = XMLin(\"$HOME/tmp/foo.xml\");\n    $FirstReject = $ref->{RejectRecord}->[0]->{Reason};\n    print \"First Reject is $FirstReject \\n\";\n\nThe a sample of the contents of the XML file is found below: Notice\nthat I've hardcode the first reference to Rejected Records by using\n[0]. Well I need to know how of these there are in the hashref $ref so\nI can iterate through. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in\nadvance.\nRay\n\nXML File foo.xml\n\n\nFAILURE: Attempt to add Customer has failed\n\nLarryBoy\n\n1234\n\n\nFAILURE: Attempt to add Customer has failed\n\nJimBob\n\n1234\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
