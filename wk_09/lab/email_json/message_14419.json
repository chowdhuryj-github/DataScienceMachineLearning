It is used, however, to define  \nindividual spots or classes of spots of interests, either to remove  \nfrom normalisation, as control spots, or just to highlight in  \ndifferent colours on your plots.\n\nIn windows I recommend you install limmaGUI from:\n\nhttp://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/\n\ngo to section 2.3.1, for a binary that will install R 2.1.1 and  \nlimmaGUI with all dependent packages.\n\nI hope this helps\n\nJose\n\nPS: remember the BioConductor forum, you're more likely to get useful  \nanswers about limmaGUI over there.\nhttp://www.bioconductor.org/docs/mailList.html\n\n-- \nDr. Jose I. de las Heras                      Email: J.delasHeras@ed.ac.uk\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology    Phone: +44 (0)131 6513374\nInstitute for Cell & Molecular Biology        Fax:   +44 (0)131 6507360\nSwann Building, Mayfield Road\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nEdinburgh EH9 3JR\nUK\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
