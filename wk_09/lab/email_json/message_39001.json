And will they get it?\n\n\nThe Leader and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party\n\n\nZombie Brown will be speaking tonight on the hustings for the leadership of the Labour Party - even though he does not face any challenge. But the Conservatives today have released some information on the donors behind the Brown campaign. \n\n\nWe'll be having a look at that and also following up last night's Newsnight debate between the candidates for the deputy leadership. It sparked off a renewed debate today between the candidates and their supporters. \n\n\nSierra Leone\n\n\nTony Blair's farewell tour of Africa takes him today to Sierra Leone where he is being greeted as a hero for helping end the country's catastrophic civil war. \n\n\nNewsnight has commissioned a personal report from the Sierra Leone film maker Sorious Samura who says he personally would shake Tony Blair's hand to say thank you - but believes Britain must do even more otherwise the country could risk slipping back into chaos. \n\n\nLives of Others\n\n\nIf you've seen the recent film \"Lives of Others\" about the former East German secret police - the Stasi - you'll know that all across Eastern Europe people are still trying to come to terms with their recent communist past. \n\n\nIn Poland the files on those who collaborated with the secret police are being made public - but in a way which some think is tearing the country apart.
