By the time Aerial came\nout, it was just another album, albeit by Kate which at least was a nice\nsurprise. I had no expectations by that point.\n\n> Donny Bravo  wrote:\n> Well, I see it as hopelessly bland. Not awful, by any stretch.

That's just ridiculous.\n\nI agree there isn't enough good material to justify a double CD and some of\nit is bland.\nI think that some of the material is among the best that Kate has ever done\nand some of it among the worst. We have 4 great tracks, 4 reasonable\ntracks, 3 decent linking pieces, 4 varying but ultimately bland tracks and\none of the least decent Kate singles ever. Overall her 4th best album, just\nabout nudging The Sensual World into 5th place.\n(If KOTM, HTBI, SIB were removed for B-sides and Pi & Nocturn given a good\nkicking then this would have been so much better.)\n\nBoolbar\n\n"}
