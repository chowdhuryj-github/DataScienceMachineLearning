But I'm not sure this way is \ncorrect or not.\n\n$ tar xfz samba-3.0.24.tar.gz\n$ cd samba-3.0.24/source\n$ ./configure\n$ make all\n$ make smbtorture\nYou can get the \"smbtorture\" binary in source/bin directory.\n\nPlease copy the \"smbtorture\" binary to Linux client machine.\n\nAnd create \"smb.conf\" on Samba server.\n[global]\n    security = share\n[netbench]\n    path = /tmp/netbench\n    read only = no\n    guest ok = yes\n\n\nNext, you can get \"client_oplocks.txt\" file  from dbench-2.1.tar.gz\nhttp://samba.org/ftp/tridge/dbench/dbech-2.1.tar.gz\nPlease copy the \"client_oplocks.txt\"  file to  the same directory\nof the \"smbtorture\" binary on client.\n\nPlease start \"smbd\" on Samba server.\n\nAnd start smbtorture on client.\n$ ./smbtorture  //192.168.0.1/netbench  -U%  -N  20  NBENCH\nYou can change by -N option how many smbtorture processes work.\n\nPlease replace \"192.168.0.1\" to your Samba server.\n\nBest Regards,\nYasuma Takeda\n\n"}
