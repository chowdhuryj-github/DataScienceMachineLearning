I haven't thought about the idea of clumping categories together. One of the reason is because these categories are bridge condition rating scores. They indeed represent different meaning and serviceability conditions. They vary from 0-9. I have about 300,000 data in which the first 5 labels, i.e. 0-4, are bad condition bridge and there are only less than 1000 instances in total. The worst case, is for example, score 0 (meaning the bridge is not operatable), I have 60 instances. Score 1 I have about 100. I would appreciate if you could provide some opinion as to how you would make the order probit fits better in this case? Thank you so much in advance.- adschai----- Original Message -----From: Robert A LaBudde Date: Friday, June 15, 2007 9:52 pmSubject: Re: [R] [Not R question]: Better fit for order probit modelTo: R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch> At 09:31 PM 6/15/2007, adschai wrote:> >I have a model which tries to fit a set of data with 10-level > >order!\n ed responses.
