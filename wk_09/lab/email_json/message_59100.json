Viagra gets me erect faster and I stay erect longer after orgasms so we can still play. Round two also arrives much sooner and I am hard quicker and longer. No side effects I know of other than the fact that sex is much improved. The effects last 3 or 4 hours, and it takes 30 to 45 minutes to kick in. 25 or 50 mg tabs work the same for me, no difference. Go for it...\nCarl Wright.\nYou can find it here \n\n\n"}
