I would like to use R to get a prediction\n(with standard error) of the response in a mixed model at selected values of\nthe fixed-effects factors. Hence, in a mixed model, say, for response body\nsize with, say, fixed factors sex and age, I would like to get a prediction\nof size for each sex and at selected ages such as 5, 10, 15; and I want a SE\nfor that prediction as well. \n\n \n\nThis can be produced in the GenStat package using the VPREDICT directive or\nfor lme-objects by predict(lmeresult, newdata, se=TRUE), but I have not\nfound out so far how predictions for the response under a mixed model in R\ncan be obtained.\n\n \n\nThanks for all, \n\n \n\nkind regards  --\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
