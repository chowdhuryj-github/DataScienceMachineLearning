We  listed  all  these  30  effects that were\n   important  for  us and the subjects received a list of photos in which\n   the  product was indicated in different size and color etc. There were\n   20 possiblities. The subjects had to order one of these photos to each\n   effect in the list.\n\n   If  I  make a chi-square test it says only that there is a significant\n   effect. I  also  want to know which property or properties caused this\n   significant effect in the deviation from expected frequency.\n\n   I would appreciate your help.\n\n   Daniel\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   FREE  pop-up  blocking  with the new MSN Toolbar [1]MSN Toolbar Get it\n   now!\n\nReferences\n\n   1. http://g.msn.com/8HMBEN/2752??PS=47575\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
