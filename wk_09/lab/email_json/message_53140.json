Try to cover all branches and conditions.\nCheck latest reports of Parrot configuration tools testing coverage to\nsee where your time available for writing tests is spent.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
