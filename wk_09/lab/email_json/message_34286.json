I don't know what it does, but it shrinks most of my plots to  \nabout 30% or original size, and I cannot detect any loss of detail  \neven when zooming several times. But it is a pain to do this with  \nAcrobat when you generate many plots... And you need to buy Acrobat.\n\nIs this something the pdf device could do in a future version? I  \ntried the \"million points\" example from the thread above and the 55  \nMB file was reduced to 6.9 MB, an even better shrinking I see on my  \nusual plots.\n\n\nDenis Chabot\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
