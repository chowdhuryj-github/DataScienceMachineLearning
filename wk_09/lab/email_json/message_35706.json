UCITA makes it clear that shrinkwrap licenses should be\npermitted to specify venue in this way.  Only Virginia and Maryland\nhave enacted UCITA, but a wide variety of other courts (see [1]) have\nruled or held that choices of venue in click-wrap and shrink-wrap\nlicenses are binding.\n\n[1]- http://eric_goldman.tripod.com/resources/onlinecontractcases.htm\n\nThus, it is not just reading a law, but also actual history, that\nmakes many of us presume that license-based forum selection is\nbinding, and leads us to judge license freedom on that basis.\n\nSeparately, for two reasons, I do not think that forum selection is a\ngood argument for reviving non-us. First, I am not convinced that the\nUSA is the only place that contractual forum selection is binding; I\nsuspect there are others.  Second, non-us was used for software that\ncould not be legally exported from the USA; using non-us for software\nunder choice-of-venue licenses would both overload the meaning and\nmean that the software could not be safely either exported from *or*\n_used in_ the United States.  Why then should we not create\n\"non-europe\" for software that is free except for the fact that the\nlicense forbids citizens of European countries from using the\nsoftware?  If the DFSG violation arises from the license, the software\nbelongs in non-free, full stop.\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n"}
