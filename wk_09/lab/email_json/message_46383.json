The court ruled the\n  administration cannot legally detain a U.S. resident suspected of ties\n  to al Qaeda without charging him. Indefinite detention of civilians would\n  have \u201cdisastrous consequences for the constitution and the\n  country,\u201d the court said. Wyatt Andrews will tell us about the man at\n  the center of this case \u2013 Ali al-Marri \u2013 and what it could mean for\n  the future of fighting terrorism within our country.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, fighting al Qaeda in Afghanistan is complicated by its neighbors\n  \u2013 especially Pakistan,\n  which is used as a safe haven by many terrorists. Our chief foreign\n  correspondent Lara Logan will report on how the sanctuary provided by Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas is taking a toll\n  on Afghanistan.\n\u00a0\nIn the United States, thousands of\n  claims have been filed in recent years against the government alleging that\n  required vaccinations caused autism in kids. The first test case among those\n  began today in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The vast majority of\n  research finds no link between vaccines and autism, but now it\u2019s the\n  court\u2019s turn to chime in. Sharyl Attkisson will report.\n\u00a0\nIn other health news, as a new study forecasts that\n  the number of Alzheimer\u2019s patients will quadruple by 2050, controversy\n  is brewing over an experimental drug. Dr. Jon LaPook will have the story.\n\u00a0\nIf you live in an urban area of the United States,\n  you may have seen detailed pictures of your neighborhood, your street, your\n  home and even yourself online\n  \u2013 thanks to Google Maps. Is the Internet search-engine giant\u2019s\n  new \u201cstreet view\u201d a helpful navigation tool or an invasion of\n  privacy? Daniel Sieberg will take a look.\n\u00a0\nFinally, if you watched the last episode of the\n  Sopranos last night, chances are you either loved it or you hated it. Richard\n  Schlesinger will report on the landmark last episode that has everybody talking.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us for these stories and\n  more,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
