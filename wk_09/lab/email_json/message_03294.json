If you did, you could \nread\n\n\nx,y\nlocations of grid lines at which the values in z are measured. These must \nbe finite, non-missing and in (strictly) ascending order. By default, \nequally spaced values from 0 to 1 are used. If x is a list, its components \nx$x and x$y are used for x and y, respectively. If the list has component \nz this is used for z.\nz\na matrix containing the values to be plotted (NAs are allowed). Note that \nx can be used instead of z for convenience.\n\nand therefore\n\nimage(1:20, 1:20, your.matrix)\n\nshall do what you probably want. And if you have different matrix size \nthen\n\n1:dim(your.matrix)[1]\n\ncan give you suitable sequence.\n\nRegards\n\nPetr Pikal\npetr.pikal@precheza.cz\n\nr-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch napsal dne 12.04.2007 10:55:21:\n\n> Greetings list,\n> \n> I have a rectangular 20 x 20 matrix with values in the range of [0 , \n> 1].
