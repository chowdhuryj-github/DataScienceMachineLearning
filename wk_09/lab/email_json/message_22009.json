Your solution is perfect! I hadn't known about the \"cut\"\nfunction. The graph is precisely what I needed. I have the ISwR book but not\nanything more advanced. Need to get some more advanced books, maybe?\n\nI have been stubbornly working on this for a few hours now, and getting\nnowhere. I wish I were able to repay in some way. \n\nThank you!\n\nGreg \n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Marc Schwartz [mailto:marc_schwartz@comcast.net] \nSent: Thursday, May 03, 2007 12:18 AM\nTo: Gregory Pierce\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Survival statistics--displaying multiple plots\n\nGreg,\n\nI suspect that you want something like this:\n\nUse the 'aml' dataset and create a 'meld' column with random values from\n1:25:\n\nlibrary(survival)\n\nset.seed(1)\naml$meld <- sample(25, 23, replace = TRUE)\n\n> aml$meld\n [1]  7 10 15 23  6 23 24 17 16  2  6  5 18 10 20 13 18 25 10 20 24  6\n[23] 17\n\n\nNow use cut() to create a 3 level factor from the values in 'meld':\n\naml$meld.grp <- cut(aml$meld, breaks = c(-Inf, 10, 20, Inf))\n\n> aml$meld.grp\n [1] (-Inf,10] (-Inf,10] (10,20]   (20, Inf] (-Inf,10] (20, Inf]\n [7] (20, Inf] (10,20]   (10,20]   (-Inf,10] (-Inf,10] (-Inf,10]\n[13] (10,20]   (-Inf,10] (10,20]   (10,20]   (10,20]   (20, Inf]\n[19] (-Inf,10] (10,20]   (20, Inf] (-Inf,10] (10,20]  \nLevels: (-Inf,10] (10,20] (20, Inf]\n\n\nNow, let's do the plot, grouping by 'meld.grp':\n\nplot(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ meld.grp, data = aml), \n     col = 1:3, legend.text = levels(aml$meld.grp),\n     legend.pos = 1)\n\n\nIf this is close, see ?cut for creating a factor from a continuous\nvector.\n\nYou can of course further tweak the plot aesthetics as you desire.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 2007-05-02 at 23:14 -0400, Gregory Pierce wrote:\n> I should clarify.
