The situation with the \ngtk canvas is really a mess, so it's hard to say which of the \nalternatives is best. It's just a weird situation to have Sugar using \nHippoCanvas, gcompris libccc and someone likely GooCanvas in the future.\n\n(Thanks for the good news btw!)\n\nMarco\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
