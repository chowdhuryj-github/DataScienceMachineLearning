I bought it from \na swiss company that ships laptops configured personally, and more \nimportantly, the laptop comes without Windows.\n\nIt will sport the new Santa Rosa chipset, with Intel graphics and Intel \nwifi 4965 abgn.\n\nI have been trying to gather information about linux support of the \nplatform, and while Intel released rich information (video driver in Xorg \nand iwlwifi driver, albeit slightly experimental), I can't seem to find \nany definitive word about basic support (i.e. SATA controller).\n\nThe few howtos about thinkpads seem conflicting with each other, so I'd \nlike to know if someone has a success story to share.\n\nAdditionally: is there a d-i that ships with a kernel > 2.6.18? Lenny's \ninstallers look a bit confusing, as they ship 2.6.21 modules with a \n2.6.18 kernel... I'll go for pure AMD64, in case it matters.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n-- \nBest Regards, Jack\nLinux User #264449\nPowered by Debian GNU/Linux on AMD64\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
