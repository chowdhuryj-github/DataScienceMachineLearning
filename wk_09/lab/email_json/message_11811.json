The Dow's hitting new highs.  The Advance Decline\nLine reveals a market whose strength and breadth haven't been seen since\n2003.  And the sectors participating include all our favorites.\n\nBut if you're not heavily invested today, something's wrong.  And I'm\nwagering it's that you're worried . . . either about the market or about\nactually pulling the trigger to buy individual stocks.\n\nSo I've got a special message for you today, and a special offer to boot.\n\n-----\n\nIntroducing Cabot Stock of the Month:\n\nA revolutionary investment advisory that brings you Wall Street's top\nopportunity on a monthly basis, directly from the editors of Cabot Market\nLetter, Cabot Top 10 Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and\nCabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.\n\nI suspect I'm a lot like you. I invest to make money. And the only stocks\nI want to invest in are the ones that are going up now.\n\nI hate it when I see a great stock take off and I'm not a part of it. And\nI'm sure you feel the same.\n\nThankfully, as the publisher of the Cabot Market Letter, Cabot Top 10\nReport, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and Cabot Benjamin Graham\nValue Letter, this situation seldom happens.\n\nThe reason is quite simple.\n\nAs the publisher of Wall Street's most respected family of investment\nadvisories, I'm in a unique position to scan the investment horizon and\nselect the most timely investment opportunities from all of our\npublications.\n\nSo unlike most investors who are chained to one investment style, waiting\nfor the market to turn their way, my unique position allows me to choose\namong the best stocks that are currently in favor across all investing\nstyles.\n\nI don't mention this to boast, but this advantage has rewarded me with\nmany eye-popping returns from across all of our publications.\n\nFor example:\n\n    * When Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall\nStreet in August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month. Since then\nit's handed investors 600% gains.\n\n    * When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was\nshooting through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month.\nIt was selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a\n2-for-1 split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.\n\n    * When the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were\nbehind in July 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months\nafter we named it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an\nincredible $160 a share.\n\nAnd there are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us\nan 88% average profit per stock over the past two years, but the reason I\nsent you this message isn't to tell you about our past successes, it's to\nmake sure you have an opportunity to own our next big winners.\n\n\nTry It Risk Free for the Next 12 Months Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!\n\nI'm Timothy Lutts, and I'm so convinced that the recommendations you'll\nread about in Cabot Stock of the Month will make you 50% richer in the\nnext 12 months, that if they don't, you won't pay a dime.\n\nYou might think I'm sticking my neck out on this one, but really I'm not.\nThat's because each of our Stocks of the Month truly represent the very\nbest opportunity in the market.\n\nOnce you see how we select them, you'll not only understand how we've been\nable to post such fantastic returns but you'll also want to add our\nmonthly recommendations to your holdings.\n\nYou see, we don't just pull our monthly recommendations out of a hat. We\nstart by taking a critical look at the entire investing landscape, paying\nparticular attention to what kinds of stocks the market is rewarding now.\n\nThen, drawing on the expertise of the editors of Cabot Market Letter,\nCabot Top 10 Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and Cabot\nBenjamin Graham Value Letter, we pick the one stock that's most likely to\nperform well -given these market conditions- in the months ahead.\n\nWe call this system spectrum investing because it enables us to use the\nwisdom of all our editors, and it gives us the freedom to pick a stock\nfrom any of their publications. The end result gives us the very best\nstock on Wall Street for that month. Take a quick look at the results, and\nI think you'll agree:\n\n    * Broadvision-up 670%\n    * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%\n    * Yahoo-up 317%\n    * Amazon.com-up 1,290%\n    * First Marblehead-up 50%\n    * International Game Technology-up 110%\n    * eResearch Technology-up 180%\n    * NetEase-up 100%\n    * Expedia-up 114%\n    * Broadcom-up 97%\n    * Netflix-up 173%\n    * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%\n    * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%\n    * Nautilus-up 109%\n\nThat's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month. It gives us the opportunity\nto choose the best stock across all sectors, using our proven spectrum\nsystem.\n\nI don't mention this to boast, but over the past three years, each one of\nour picks for Stock of the Month have not only included Wall Street's\nbiggest winners but also out-performed the indexes by five times - even as\nthe market slid sideways from January 2002 through December 2004.\n\nFrankly, this is why every one of our recommendations comes with our \"50%\nricher\" guarantee. So should you decide to join us and any of our\nrecommendations fails to bring you the results I've promised here, you can\ncancel and receive a complete refund -no questions asked- even right up to\nyour last issue.\n\n--- Click Here To Get Started Now! ---\n\nhttp://www.cabotinvestors.com/esomhcwa01r\n\nShould You Say \"Yes,\" Here's What You'll Find in Every Profit Packed\nIssue\n\nIn each issue, you'll get the facts and analysis behind the\nrecommendation. You'll know why we selected this stock and the factors\nthat convinced us it's the best profit opportunity for the current market\nconditions.\n\nEconomic Outlook: Make no mistake about it; the economy is always\nchanging. Because economic outlook determines which stocks are in favor or\nout, in each and every issue of Cabot Stock of the Month we'll bring you a\npanoramic overview of the latest market conditions.\n\nComplete Company Summary: And when I say complete, I mean it. Unlike other\nfinancial advisories that barely scrape the surface, my team of\nresearchers and I delve so deep into the company's potential and take such\na broad view of the investment landscape that we often know more about the\nstock's prospects in the current market climate than the guys running the\ncompany!\n\nMonthly Stock Updates: You'll be glad to know that once we recommend a\nstock, our work doesn't end there. We continue to analyze each of our\nrecommendations and bring you the latest news for as long as it remains on\nour recommended list. That way, you'll always have all the information you\nneed to maximize your profits.\n\nE-mail Alerts: While I've designed Cabot Stock of the Month to bring you\nthe strongest stock on Wall Street each month, the fact is we're in a\nperiod of unprecedented and dynamic change.
