You can still directly access\n  them via \"vcd:::cd_plot\" (which is the main work horse).\n\nStrategy 2 (preferred, especially if you want to take a closer look):\n  Obtain the source package from CRAN. Unpack the tar.gz file and\n  look into the vcd/R folder where you will find cd_plot.R containing\n  the sources of both methods.\n\ngrx,\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
