The\nwriteMM function is writing 0-based indices when they should be\n1-based.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  It's rather\nembarrassing that we didn't create such a test and discover it for\nourselves.\n\nThis will be fixed in the next release.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
