What I want to be able to do is call the dip routine from\nthe diptest package. I've tried using the code from the package\ndirectly, but I think it needs to have had other procedures to be run on\nthe data before-hand.\n\nAny ideas as I'd be very grateful.\nJames\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
