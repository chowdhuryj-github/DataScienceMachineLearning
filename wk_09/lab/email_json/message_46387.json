I\nhave some data that is presently in a large number of text files, and I\nwould like to be able to select elements of each text file (elements are\nalways on the same line, in the same position) and organize them into a\ntable.  Is there a tool to select text in this way in R?  What I am looking\nfor would be somewhat similar to the left() and right() functions in Excel.\nI have looked at the parse() and scan() functions, but don't think they can\ndo what I want (although I could be wrong).\nThank you,\nTim\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
