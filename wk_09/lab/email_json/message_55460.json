I have just uploaded a new version of plotrix in which \ncolor2D.matplot will handle NAs appropriately, doing such things as \nupper or lower triangles of matrices. Look for version 2.2-2 when it \npops up on CRAN.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
