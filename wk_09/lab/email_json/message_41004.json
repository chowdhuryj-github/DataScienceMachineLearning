If Z and C are observed at the same points, and what you are\nlooking for are clusters of correlated values of Z with C, the clusters\nare not the locations of the points, but rather the co-occurrence of\nhigh/low values of Z and C respectively. How to go forward from here would\ndepend on what kind of process you are actually interested in. More \ndetail might help - as might following up on R-sig-geo, rather than on the \ngeneral list. \n\n> \n> Thanks!\n> \n> K.\n>  \n>        \n> ---------------------------------\n> \n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n\n-- \nRoger Bivand\nEconomic Geography Section, Department of Economics, Norwegian School of\nEconomics and Business Administration, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen,\nNorway. voice: +47 55 95 93 55; fax +47 55 95 95 43\ne-mail: Roger.Bivand@nhh.no\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
