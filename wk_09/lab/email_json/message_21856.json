Imagine getting up in the morning and knowing that's as good as you're going to feel all day.\n\nFashions are born and they die too quickly for anyone to learn to love them.\n\nAll glory comes from daring to begin.\n\nI am lord of myself, accountable to none.\n\nThe God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.\n\nAn evil life is a kind of death.\n\nWhat's wrong with being a boring kind of guy?\n\nI would never have amounted to anything were it not for adversity. I was forced to come up the hard way.\n\nIt is a fine thing to be honest, but it is also very important to be right.\n\nThe amplest knowledge has the largest faith. Ignorance is always incredulous.\n\nMan is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\n\n\n"}
