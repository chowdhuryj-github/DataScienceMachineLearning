The trouble is I can't figure out how to estimate y values for\nthe test set using the model derived from the training set. I've been\nfiddling about with predict(), but can't seem to get the desired result.\nCould somebody help please? Thanks very much in advance.\n \nBest wishes,\nDes\n \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
