Recently,\nI think from the latest update some warning messages started to appear,\nwhen I use my old data-file and R-histories (hence, everything was done\nbefore and worked perfectly well). It seems to me that those are related\nto the Design package, but I am not sure.\nOne is coming out after:\n> d = datadist(a,b,c)\nWarning message:\n$ operator is deprecated for atomic vectors, returning NULL in:\nX[[1]]$terms\n\nAnd the other after using ols() or lrm() etc.:\nWarning messages:\n1: use of storage.mode(x) <- \"single\" is deprecated: use mode<- instead\n\n(this one is repeating: 2, 3, 4 times)\n\nWhat I do wrong? Could you help me? I realized that there were some\nimportant changes in the newest realises, and that some of them are,\nprobably, related to the above warnings, but still I would like to have\nan explanation and an advice how to fix if something is wrong.\n\nThanks in advance,\nPM\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
