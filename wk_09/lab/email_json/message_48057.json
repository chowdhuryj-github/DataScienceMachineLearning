Can I also send it a signal to\nwake it up from another process? For the next step in this project I\nhave to split send and receive into two threads in order to handle a\nfull duplex connection. The ACK/NAK can be embedded anywhere in the\nincoming data stream.\n\nBob McConnell\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
