Particularly, changed\nthe name of the flag from PARROT_ARG_OBJECT to PARROT_ARG_INVOCANT,\nmoved the code for handling object overrides of 'invoke' from\ndelegate.pmc to parrotobject.pmc, and kept the regression test for RT\n#41732 (still relevant, it just has to check for \"2 params\" in the error\nmessage instead of \"1 params\"). Also added a test for inherited 'invoke'\noverrides.\n\nAllison\n\n"}
