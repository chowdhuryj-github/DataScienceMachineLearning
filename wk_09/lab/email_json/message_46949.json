I've read that certain problems can arise based on the compiler used and that these problems can sometimes cause R not to be able to access everything appropriately, but I've not found how to fix any of these problems. Specifically, after using dyn.load, I know the dll has been loaded because it is listed in getLoadedDLLs(), but when I try is.loaded(\"subroutine name\"), it returns FALSE. I saw that this was mentioned in the manual, but it too offers little help for a solution.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nIan McCarthy\nDepartment of Economics\nIndiana University\n100 S.
