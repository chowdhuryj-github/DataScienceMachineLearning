I am mostly looking to perform a sensitivity analysis with this \nmodel and dataset - perhaps there are other methods?\n\nthanks\n\n-- \nDylan Beaudette\nSoils and Biogeochemistry Graduate Group\nUniversity of California at Davis\n530.754.7341\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
