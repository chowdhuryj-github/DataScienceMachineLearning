There are several official mirrors, implemented\nthrough DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make\nsecurity updates available as quickly and easily as possible.\n\nEncouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity\nthat is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these\nmirrors are not kept up to date. Official mirrors, however, are planned\nto be implemented in the future.\n\n\ni think now is \"the future\" ;-)\n\n\n-- \n\n5o   Peter.Mann at tuke.sk\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-mirrors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
