I added those single quotes\nbased on an early R-list posting  suggesting that the\nspace in \"Program Files\" was a problem. \n\nActually by that time I was down to superstitious\nlearning but the idea seemed reasonable.\n> \n> sas.get() calls a function, shQuote(), which wraps\n> the program name in double quotes and then escapes\n> the double quotes you are passing, which messes up\n> the program name that Windows sees.\n\nOh I see what you mean.  \n> \n> I don't understand exactly what problem you are\n> having with the library names.

Try\nit on a USB and see what happens.  Things seem to work\njust fine on a hard drive.  Currently I am blaming the\nproblem on SAS's outdated view of the world :) .\n\nMost of my SAS (as opposed to R problems) seem to\ndisappear when I move the files to the C: drive.\nSomething I should have thought of sooner.\n\n\n>If changing the sasprog parameter value\n> as above doesn't work, write back to the R-help with\n> the errors you get and someone (maybe even me :-)\n> should be able to help.\n\nThanks, you have been very helpful already.  Stand by\nfor the difficult questions :)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
