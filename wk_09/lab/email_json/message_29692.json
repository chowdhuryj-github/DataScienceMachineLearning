I have the examination results of 1000 pupils on three subjects, one score every term. So, I have three scores for English (one for every term), three scores for maths etc. However, not everybody was examined in maths, not everybody was examined in English etc, but everybody was in effect examined on four subjects. I also have information abouit the school. Would this model hive the right results for the variance components?\n>\n> mod_3_f  <- lmer(SCORE ~ GENDER + (1 |ID ) + (1 | TERM) + (1 | SUBJECT)  , Dataset)\n>\n> Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n> Formula: SCORE ~ GENDER + (1 | ID) + (1 | TERM) + (1 | SUBJECT)\n>    Data: Dataset\n>     AIC    BIC  logLik MLdeviance REMLdeviance\n>  247882 247926 -123936     247871       247872\n> Random effects:\n>  Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n>  ID       (Intercept) 5.97288  2.44395\n>  TERM     (Intercept) 5.10307  2.25900\n>  SUBJECT  (Intercept) 0.25943  0.50934\n>  Residual             4.41673  2.10160\n> number of obs: 53978, groups: ID, 5695; TERM, 4; SUBJECT, 4\n> Fixed effects:\n>                Estimate Std.

(Use sessionInfo() to\ncheck.)  I think the bug that causes that warning has been fixed in\nthe most recent version.\n\n>             (Intr)\n> GENDER[T.M] -0.023\n\n> How do I interpert the results?\n\nDo you really want to treat SUBJECT as a random effect?  I think it\nwould be more common to treat it as a fixed effect.  If I understand\nyou correctly there are only two levels of SUBJECT and these are\nrepeatable levels. If that is the case one could model SUBJECT as a\nfixed effect or consider its interaction within student with the term\n(SUBJECT|ID).\n\nIt would make sense to regard the pair of responses in maths and\nEnglish for each student in each term as a multivariate response but,\nat present, that model cannot be fit with lmer.\n\nI would also question whether you want the TERM to be modeled with a\nrandom effect.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
