Why? \n\n\nThat's a question we'll try and answer tonight. Also can these two things be true: those working in the health service have never been unhappier; the NHS is in the best shape it has ever been. \n\n\nIn January, we asked doctors about their career experiences and got a  huge response.  How are things now? \n\n\nWe want to hear your opinion whether you work in the NHS or have had experience of using it as a patient.
