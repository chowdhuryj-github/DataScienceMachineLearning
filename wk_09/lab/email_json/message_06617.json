If it is the latter then you can use \nthe `type=\"lpmatrix\" argument to predict.gam, in order to obtain the matrix \nwhich maps the model coefficients to the estimated linear predictor of the \nGAM. The columns of this matrix are made up of the evaluated basis functions \nfor the smooth terms, which is usually all you need.\n\nThere are some examples of this sort of thing in ?predict.gam.\n\nbest,\nSimon\n\n\n>   Thank you in advance!\n>\n>   Jin Huang\n>   North Carolina State University\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> ---------------------------------\n> Ahhh...imagining that irresistible \"new car\" smell?\n>\n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide\n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal,\n> self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n-- \n> Simon Wood, Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY UK\n> +44 1225 386603  www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~sw283\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
