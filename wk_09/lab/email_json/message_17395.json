Is \nthere a function in R that would allow me to do this?\n\nI'm working with vegetation presence-absence matrices based on field \nobservations. The matrices are formatted to have sites as rows and \nspecies as columns. The presence of a species on a site is indicated \nwith a 1 (absence is obviously indicated with a 0).\n\nI would like to randomise the matrices many times in order to construct \nnull models. However, I cannot identify a function in R to do this, and \nthe programming looks tricky for someone of my limited skills.\n\nCan anybody help me out?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nNick Cutler\n\nInstitute of Geography\nSchool of Geosciences\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nDrummond Street\nEdinburgh EH8 9XP\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTel: 0131 650 2532\nWeb: http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0455078\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
