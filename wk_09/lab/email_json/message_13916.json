However, those error numbers don't really mean \nanything to me.  Can you copy and paste the *exact* output of the entire run \nafter you type 'make' and 'make test', including the error output?\n\nAlso, can you include the my_config file with your report?  The Makefile \ndoesn't do us much good.  We have a pretty good idea of what *should* happen.  \nWhat actually *did* happen is much more valuable!\n\nThanks,\n-- c\n\n"}
