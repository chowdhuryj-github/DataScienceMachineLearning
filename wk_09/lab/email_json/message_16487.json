Essentially, you take turns to\ndrop pieces into columns, trying to make a line of four.\n\nWhat's significant about this activity is that it uses the networked D-Bus\nservice provided by Telepathy (aka \"Tubes\") to perform the communication, and\nis the first program to do so.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n - a copy of D-Bus with the dbus_message_(de)marshal functions patched in;\n   this patch is in CVS, so sugar-jhbuild dbus is fine\n - the \"tubes\" branch of Telepathy Gabble\n\nGit repository:\n\nhttp://projects.collabora.co.uk/~daf/connect-activity.git/\n\nCaveats:\n\n - has a race condition where an activity instance will not notice the other\n   player also waiting for the game\n - doesn't detect when the game has been won\n - doesn't allow for restarting the game\n - controls are keyboard-only\n - hardcodes activity channel to use; in time, once the presence service does\n   invitations, it won't need to do this\n\n-- \nDafydd\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
