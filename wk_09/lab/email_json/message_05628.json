You may only\nexercise those permissions that remain.\n\nThe set of restrictions you must meet is the *sum* of the restrictions\nrequired by all licenses to the work. You must satisfy all\nrestrictions simultaneously, or you have no license to perform the\ndesired act.\n\n-- \n \\       \"A lot of people are afraid of heights.
