Each trial\ncan take either of two outcomes, success or failure.\n\nA dummy data set:\nn.trials <- sample(5:7, 50, replace=T, prob=c(0.2, 0.6, 0.2))\nsuccess <- rbinom(50, n.trials, p=0.5)\nfailure <- n.trials - success\n\nI know I could test for a deviation from 50:50 success:failure in one or\nthe other direction using a glm with binomial errors. However, I\nsuspect that in my 'real' data set the outcome 50:50 is\nunderrepresented, not due to a skew in one particular direction, but\nrather that within each observation there are either many successes or\nmany failures. Although I did not manage to create a dummy data set\nwith these properties, which would be the proper way in R to test for a\n'lack of 50:50 outcome' using the simple dummy data above as a starting\npoint?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHenrik\n\n--\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
