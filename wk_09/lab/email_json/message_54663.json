You might have better luck with\n\nlog1p(tasa)\n\nif the authors of the Matrix package have written a method for log1p(); \nif not, you'll probably have to do it yourself.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
