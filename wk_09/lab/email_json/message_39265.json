I'm honestly not sure which of the large number of files I need to download, if any.  I find myself wishing that Debian would just include Speakup in the kernel by default--but you can't have everything, I suppose.  I have Etch at the moment with 2.6.18.\n    Does anybody have any advice on how to proceed from here?\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
