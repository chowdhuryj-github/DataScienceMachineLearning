Is that good news?\nIt is bad advice that cannot be changed.\nExperience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power.\nNothing is so soothing to our self esteem as to find our bad traits in our forebears. It seems to absolve us.\nWhen you do something, you should burn yourself up completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.\nAnd let the winds of the heavens dance between you.\nEvery thought derives from a thwarted sensation.\nYou can't live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you.\nTo find a fault is easy to do better may be difficult.\nThey are the only honest hypocrites, their life is a voluntary dream, a studied madness.\nThe misfortunes hardest to bear are these which never came.\nNothing leads to good that is not natural.\nA hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is braver five minutes longer.\nOne cannot really be a Catholic and grown up.\nReason guides but a small part of man, and the rest obeys feeling, true or false, and passion, good or bad.\nThere are evils that have the ability to survive identification and go on for ever... money, for instance, or war.\nMen do not value a good deed unless it brings a reward.\nExistence really is an imperfect tense that never becomes a present.\nTo buy books would be a good thing if we also could buy the time to read them.\n\u00a0"}
