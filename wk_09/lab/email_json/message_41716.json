I've run a sugar-jhbuild, and with a work-around hack to get \naround my previous problem, I can now run the sugar desktop.  However, \nwhen I click to start an activity, it will show up in the ring for a \nlittle while (a few seconds) then disappear, never starting fully.  Here \nis a complete log of a sugar session in which I try to start the Write \nactivity: presumably the interesting stuff is at the end.  (I'm on AMD64 \nif that makes a difference, Ubuntu Feisty)\n\nI am wondering if there is anything I can do to fix this issue, or if it \nis a problem in the source.  (and if so, if it's easy enough for me to \nfix).
