Yes, I guess what I am looking for is\nthe actual numerical value for aspect.ratio that is used when aspect =\n\"fill\".  My device is a pdf and I don't resize it.  Could I execute the\nwhole plot, including printing it, while saving the aspect.ratio that\nwas used, then create the plot again?\n\nScott Waichler\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
