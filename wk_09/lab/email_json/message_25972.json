A resumption of diplomatic relations and rectification of boundaries.\nThe man who does not read books has no advantage over the man that can not read them.\nThe days are too short even for love how can there be enough time for quarreling?\nA torchlight procession marching down your throat.\nIf you did not look after today's business then you might as well forget about tomorrow.\nOld things are always in good repute, present things in disfavor.\nThe measure of a man is the way he bears up under misfortune.\nAbsence blots people out. We really have no absent friends.\nA baby is born with a need to be loved and never outgrows it.\nIt doesn't take a hero to order men into battle. It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.\nWhatever advice you give, be short.\nI wasted time, and now time doth waste me.\nThere are no atheists in foxholes.\nAn empty purse and a new house make a man wise, but too late.\nEvery life is its own excuse for being.\nWe are happier in many ways when we are old than when we were young. The young sow wild oats. The old grow sage.\nThe anger of a person who is strong, can always bide its time.\nOh! death will find me long before I tire of watching you.\n\u00a0"}
