I'm dealing with large\nfixed-width data \nsets that look like\n\n539001..\n639001..\n639001..\n...\n539002..\n639002..\n...\n\nPresently, I am using read.fwf to read an entire file, but I am\ninterested only in \nreading those records beginning with 5.  I have been unable to find help\nin any of \nthe suggested resources.\n\nI understand this is a SAS example that replicates what I'm looking to\ndo, if it's of\nany help to anyone.\n\nstreet type\t\tname\t\t\t\t\tam\ntraffic\tpm traffic\n\nfreeway\t\t408\t\t\t\t\t3684\n3459\nsurface\t\tMartin Luther King Jr. Blvd.\t1590\t\t1234\nfreeway\t\t608\t\t\t\t\t4583\n3860\nfreeway\t\t808\t\t\t\t\t2386\n2518\nsurface\t\tLake Shore Dr.\t\t\t1590\t\t1234\n\nINPUT type $ @;\nIF type = 'surface' THEN DELETE;\nINPUT name $ 9-38 amtraff pmtraff;\n\nAny answers, suggestions, or points-in-the-right-direction would be much\nappreciated.\n\n--\n\nJared Tobin, Student Research Assistant\nDept. of Fisheries and Oceans\ntobinjr@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
