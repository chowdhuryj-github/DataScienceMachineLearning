Though you will have to do a little homework to\nconfigure it.Start here, and then look for the many excellent hand-holdingtutorials online. The key concept is that Mutt does mail like nobody'sbusiness but you need other small Unix tools (like, eg Exim or\nSendmail to SEND the mail; fetchmail or getmail to GET the mail; andMaildrop or Procmail to put the mail in the right boxes.)\u00a0\u00a0Read abouthow this works FIRST.
