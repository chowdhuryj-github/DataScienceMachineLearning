The newest draft specification is \n802.11n, whose multiple data streams promise faster transfers and longer range \nthan before. It's also intended to eliminate the problems of interference and \nspotty coverage that sometimes occur with the current standard. A number of \n\"n\"-based routers are already available.\n\nUnfortunately for consumers, the \"n\" standard is still in draft stage and is not \nexpected to be ratified by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \n(IEEE) until 2009. An unratified status means the specification could change, \nleaving consumers stranded with an incompatible product that may or may not be \neasy to upgrade. For this reason, a number of reviewers shied away in 2006 from \nrecommending \"n\"-based products.\n\nNow the climate seems to be changing. Manufacturers have worked together over \nthe last year to create \"n\"-based routers that work well and work together. A \nnumber of commentators and reviewers, including \n PC Magazine and the \n computing column of the Houston Chronicle, have begun to recommend these \nproducts.\n\nHere's my advice: If you aren't suffering from the problems that the \"n\" standard \nis meant to solve \u2014 slow speeds and inadequate range \u2014 there's little reason to \nrisk isolating yourself with a product that may be outdated soon by a changing \nstandard. I suspect that most home and small-business users are not likely to \nneed the new technology in the near term.\n\n\n\n\nNetgear is the hardware firewall of choice\n\n\n\nThere's no clear winner in the latest batch of router reviews, but Netgear's \n\nRangeMax 240 WPNT834 has garnered an Editor's Choice from \nPC Magazine \nand got high marks from other publications as well. This pre-\"n\" router includes \nthe WPA2 encryption standard (which is the current leader and one I recommend) \nand includes four LAN ports, in addition to wireless capabilities. \nIts price online ranges from US$50 to US$120. The separate NetGear \n WPNT511 notebook adapter card is not required, but is likely to improve speed and \ncompatibility. It sells for US$85 (street).\n\n\n\n\nZoneAlarm remains the top-rated suite\n\n\n\nLong a favorite among testers, \n\nZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite ($50 street) is still the preferred security suite among respected \nreviewers. Like other products in this category, this suite includes software \nfirewall, antivirus, and antispyware as well as other OS and privacy-protection \nfeatures. It recently received an Editor's Choice from \n CNET, which cited its \"perfect balance between best-of-breed security protection and ease \nof use.\"\n\nIn previous editions of the WSN Security Baseline, we've recommended a separate \nantispyware utility because the tools in the security suites weren't yet up to snuff. \nThat no longer appears to be the case. CNET\n notes that the antispyware tools in ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite continue \nto improve, and the Apr. 10, 2007, \nPC Magazine goes so far as to say \nthat the ZoneAlarm suite \"blocked and removed spyware better than the best \nstandalone antispyware products (and better than NIS 2007).\"\n\nNIS 2007, known formally as \n Norton Internet Security 2007, is a major alternative to ZoneAlarm and \nreceived an Editor's Choice designation in the Apr. 10 PC Magazine.\n\n\n\n\nMS Update and PatchLink for patch management\n\n\n\nFor novices, we continue to recommend the free \nMicrosoft Update \n(which requires Internet Explorer) to update Microsoft Office and a few other \nMicrosoft products as well as Windows itself. As before, we advise users to \nconfigure Microsoft Update to Notify me but don't automatically download and \ninstall. Then, keep reading Windows Secrets to learn which updates might be risky or \nundesirable to install.\n\nFor businesses with solid IT experience, it's useful to have an independent tool \nfor downloading and installing Windows patches and upgrades. \n Windows IT Pro Magazine recently gave its Editor's Choice to \nPatchLink Update, \nwhich costs $1,495 for a network server plus $18 annually per Windows machine. \nThe same product received a Best Patch Management award from \nSC Magazine \nduring its 2006 SC Awards Europe. The product gets especially high marks for \nnetworks that support a mixture of operating systems.\n\nFor larger networks, the \n Window Security site \ngives its recently updated gold rating to  GFI LANguard Network Security Scanner ($575 for 32 machines).\n\n\n\n\nThe WSN Security Baseline as it stands\n\n\n\nTo see a summary of the end-user security products that are currently top-rated by test \nlabs, visit the \n\nWSN Security Baseline page. As changes occur in the ratings, \nwe'll give you updates here in the newsletter.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

These Microsoft \npages support the view that any \"system builder\" \ncan legally purchase and install OEM software \u2014 even a home hobbyist who just \nworks with a single machine. Microsoft's \n OEM license agreement defines a system builder as \"an original equipment \nmanufacturer, an assembler, refurbisher, or pre-installer of \nsoftware on computer systems.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\nNaturally, the other limitations of the OEM version, which I mentioned in the \nApr. 26 issue, still apply, \nincluding the lack of technical support from Microsoft and the fact that the license \ncan't be transferred to another machine under the license terms.\n\nA February blog posting on the Partner Program site asks, \"Can a \nsystem builder sell an OEM copy of Windows Vista without attaching it to a piece \nof hardware?\" The answer that follows is:\n\n\n\n\"YES! YES! YES you can!!!!!!! As long as you do not open the package AND the end \nuser is assembling their own PC (at that point the user is considered a system \nbuilder). [Emphasis added.] As of August 2005, the licensing changed on all \nof the OEM licensing packs \u2014 1, 3, and 30.\"\n\n\nAnother page on this private site states:\n\n\n\n\"OEM system builder software packs are intended for PC and server manufacturers \nor assemblers ONLY. They are not intended for distribution to end users. Unless \nthe end user is actually assembling his/her own PC, in which case, that end user \nis considered a system builder as well.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nFigure 1. This image from Microsoft's Partner Program site, which is \navailable only to registered users, clearly states that vendors can \nsell the OEM version of Windows as a 1-pack to individuals who are \nbuilding a system, as long as the packaging is not opened by the \nvendor.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft has chosen to hide some of its clearest statements \nabout the sale of OEM software to end users on a Web site that is only available to those who \njoin the Microsoft Partner Program (see Figure 1).\n\nA further annoyance is that the license agreement states that OEM software \nmust be installed using Microsoft's OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK). According to a Microsoft \n Web page, although the OPK tool is included with the \"3-pack\" \nOEM version of Windows and Office 2003, it is not included with \nthe 1-user OEM version of Windows and Office 2003. To obtain the tool, \nan individual system builder must download it from the members-only \nMicrosoft Partner Program Web site.\n\nThe good news, however, is that any business (however small) can \njoin the Partner Program at no charge.\n\n\n\nQuick fixes for subscription subterfuge\n\n\n\nReader responses poured in after my \nMay 17 \nstory on security firms that make it difficult for you to opt out of \nautomatic credit-card charges.\n\nWe received a lot of good tips, tricks, and suggestions for avoiding surprises \non your credit-card statements. Many people sent in solutions, like this one \nfrom Steve Himel:\n\n\n\n\"I avoid the whole automatic subscription renewal of security products by simply \npurchasing the retail, boxed version of the software. So far, I have been able to \nregister the software to obtain updates for a year without giving away a credit-card \nnumber. When the year is up, I simply purchase a new retail version of \nsecurity software \u2014 either the same product, or I can switch to a different product. \nAlso, with sales and rebates, the cost of a new retail package is often less \nthan the subscription-renewal price.\"\n\n\nGood points, Steve. As other readers noted, this strategy also gives you a \nphysical disk that acts as a backup if you need to reinstall the product. \nMoreover, in most cases, subscriptions only update your virus and spyware \ndefinitions, but don't upgrade the product to the newest version. Buying a new \nbox each year ensures you have the latest version.\n\n\n\nUse virtual credit-card numbers\n\n\n\nAn enormous number of readers suggested \nsingle-use credit-card numbers, a feature offered by some credit-card companies. \nFor example, Matthew Persico explains his strategy:\n\n\n\n\"When I use a vendor site, I give them a VAN \u2014 a Virtual Account Number. \nCitibank provides this service for all Citibank credit card holders. Each time \nyou want to put a credit card number in a form, you can generate a temporary number, \ngood for only one use. When they try to charge the card the following year, they \ndiscover 'Oops, it expired!' \"\n\n\nBut one reader, Raymond Clouser, wasn't so sure this would work. \nAs he explains:\n\n\n\n\"A few years ago, I thought I found the answer through the single-use credit-card \nnumbers offered by American Express and Discover cards. However, that was not the \nanswer, according to what I was told by credit-card company representatives. I \nwas told that the single-transaction numbers were not really single-transaction. \nInstead, the single numbers were between the user and the company you used it \nwith, and they could later bill you for additional charges, unless you challenged \nit with the credit card company.\"\n\n\nI called Citibank to check its policy with virtual account numbers. A \nrepresentative told me that the numbers were, indeed, solely event-based and \nthat a subscription company could not use the same number a year later to charge \nyour card. This service is free to Citibank customers; all it requires is an \nInternet connection. See the company's \n\nWeb site for more information.\n\nNaturally, readers will want to check out the policies of their individual \ncredit-card companies to see if this service is available, and whether it would \nsolve this particular problem.\n\nIn the paid version of today's newsletter, you'll find more ways to defeat \nsubscription subterfuge, as well as a tip on Data Execution Prevention relating to my \nMay 3 \narticle on the subject.\n\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTELL A FRIEND\n\nHow you can share this information\nWe love it when you send your friends links to our articles.
