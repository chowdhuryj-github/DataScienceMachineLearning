Thanks!\n\nWell, after some more work, problem fixed.  All those errors are not\ncritical.  What was essential was using the sl-modem-source driver,\ninstead of the alsa snd_intel8x0m which was loaded by default.  I\nwasn't getting ring messages and thus vgetty was never answering the\nphone.  The non-alsa driver apparently does something right and it works.\n\nI suppose not too many people are using modems anymore, but hopefully\nthis will help someone.\n\nA.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
