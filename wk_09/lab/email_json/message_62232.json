The problem I posted is just a bit of my problem. The whole problem is that; \n  1. I simulated a multivariate data set X (n by p)\n  2. Then draw sample without replacement from X (k less than n)\n  3. Compute the eigen values of the variance-covariance matrix of the sample drawn\n  4. Store the eigen values in matrix eigenvals\n  5. Store the samples(that is the row identifier) drawn in rowvals\n  6. Bind the two matrices using rbind.\n  The problem is;\n  7. Now I want the print out of the maximum values of the eigenvalues product and samples that give such maximum product.\n  Thanks\n  Oyeyemi Gafar M.\n\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nFussy?
