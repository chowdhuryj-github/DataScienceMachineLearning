This way both NTLM and Negotiate auth types can be performed \nagainst a Windows domain. Proxy authentication is supported as well.\n\nThe source of this package still is present in Samba's CVS only (no any \nupstream site for now), but the code itself is stable and has enough \nhistory of usage. (For the source, see \nhttp://viewcvs.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind/?root=lorikeet \n)\n\nI shall maintain this package in Fedora.\n\nYou can already check binary rpm packages in \"updates-testing\" repository:\nhttp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/7/i386/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind-0.0.0-0.5.20070129svn713.fc7.i386.rpm\nas well as the source rpm:\nhttp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/7/SRPMS/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind-0.0.0-0.5.20070129svn713.fc7.src.rpm\nand builds for another arches (x86_64, ppc, ppc64):\nhttp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/7/x86_64/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind-0.0.0-0.5.20070129svn713.fc7.x86_64.rpm\nhttp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/7/x86_64/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind-0.0.0-0.5.20070129svn713.fc7.ppc.rpm\nhttp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/7/x86_64/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind-0.0.0-0.5.20070129svn713.fc7.ppc64.rpm\n\nSoon it should appear for general usage in Fedora \"updates\" repository.\n\nNotes:\n- some cosmetic (?) patch was needed for 64bit arches.\n- it seems that it is a time to provide \"normal\" upstream tarball \nsomewhere (what about ftp.samba.org/pub/mod_auth_ntlm_winbind -- the \nsame way as for rsync and rzip ?..)\n\n\nRegards,\nDmitry Butskoy\nhttp://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/DmitryButskoy\n\n"}
