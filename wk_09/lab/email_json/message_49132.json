That is a change in 2.5.0 but not a bug.\nIf you chose not to ask for it, we presume you did not want it.\n\nParts of graphics are useful without any graphics device and there are \ngraphics devices in other packages, so it seemed reasonable to allow users \nthe choice of whether they got grDevices.\n\n\nOn Sat, 16 Jun 2007, Patrick Connolly wrote:\n\n> On Sat, 16-Jun-2007 at 04:09PM +1200, Patrick Connolly wrote:\n>\n> |> On Fri, 15-Jun-2007 at 01:50PM -0700, Li-Jung Liang wrote:\n> |>\n> |> |> Hi,\n> |> |>\n> |> |> I upgraded my system from FC4 to FC5.
