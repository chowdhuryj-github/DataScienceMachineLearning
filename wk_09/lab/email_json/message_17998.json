Altered versions must be clearly and explicitly marked as such,\n     and must not be misrepresented as being the original software.\n     Significantly altered versions may not be distributed (neither\n     in source nor binary form), by a name that could be confused \n     with a name of this software (\"ion\", \"ion3\", etc.), without \n     additional very explicit component that indicates that the \n     version is non-standard.\n\nmeans you should call it something like \"ion-debian-patched\", just to\navoid conflict if there is a difference of opinion on what\n\"significant\" means.\n\nCheers,\nWalter Landry\nwlandry@ucsd.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
