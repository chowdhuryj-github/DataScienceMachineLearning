I would suggest \nsomething like this:\n\ngap.barplot(y,c(500,19800),main=\"Skewed distribution\",\n  yaxlab=c(200,400,19900),ytics=c(200,400,19900))\n\nwhere y is the right column of your data.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
