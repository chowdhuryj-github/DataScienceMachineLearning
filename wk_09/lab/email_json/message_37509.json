My comment was that had been altered, and path.expand was not \naltered to follow.  Duncan M suggests that was uninportant, but I thought \nit worth fixing.\n\n> The fact that some of windows software may not \"work with\"\n> the user's home directory (but rather a subdirectory of that),\n> may be a separate issue, but then,  \"I'm the windows-non-expert\"\n>\n> Martin Maechler\n>\n\n-- \nBrian D.
