(eg. a dataset containing a mixture of continuous,\ncategorical and date/time variables)  I'm looking for something which\nI can use for testing and examples for my ggplot graphics package.  A\nselection of datasets which use different date time classes would also\nbe useful, although I could probably create them myself.\n\nI've looked for sample data in chron, its and zoo, but none of them\ninclude sample data. Although I haven't looked at the sample data in\nstats exhaustively, I am looking for something richer and with more\nobservations, than the data typically found there.\n\nThanks,\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
