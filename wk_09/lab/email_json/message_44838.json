They have several advantages over constants:\n1) They can be defined lexically - constants are globals (because\nthey're implemented as subroutines)\n2) They interpolate into strings, because they're real variables\n3) You can define Readonly hashes and arrays as well as scalars.\n\nSo many people would prefer you abandon the first example I gave, and\nreplace it with:\nuse Readonly;\nReadonly my $PI => 3.14;\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
