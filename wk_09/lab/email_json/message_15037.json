Seeing no replies to the enquiry about 3D\n                 histograms,  I thought I'd try to get Goodal's code \nrunning\n                 in R to see if it might solve guarav's problem.\n\n                 The trouble is, all the guts of the procedure, \n*including*\n                 the plotting are done from within Fortran.  The actual\n                 plotting seems to be done through a call to a subroutine\n                 ``segmtz'' which is a piece of Splus software that does \nnot\n                 exist in R.\n\n                 Is there an equivalent subroutine in R that could be \ncalled?\n                 I dug around a bit but couldn't figure out what was going\n                 on.  The function segments() simply calls\n                 .Internal(segments(....\n\n                 I looked around a bit for corresponding C or Fortran code \nbut\n                 obviously didn't know how to look properly.\n\n                 I think that the Fortran code could be translated into \nraw R\n                 and the call to segmtz changed to a call to segments() \n---\n                 but this would seem to be a lot of work.\n\n                 Can anyone suggest a reasonably simple way of replacing \nthe\n                 call to segmtz in the Fortran?\n\n                                        cheers,\n\n                                                Rolf Turner\n                                                rolf@math.unb.ca\n\n\n\n============================================================================================\nDISCLAIMER AND CONFIDENTIALITY CAUTION:\\ \\ This message and ...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
