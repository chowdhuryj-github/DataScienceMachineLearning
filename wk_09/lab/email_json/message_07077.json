Well, apparently the Grand Poobah (i.e.,\nTim) was so happy with mine and Paul's write-ups that we're now on spot\nCWA duty.  (That's right:  I did a good job writing ... so now I have to\ndo more work.  Gotta love it!)  Seriously though, you'll be getting my\n(and, separately, Paul's) latest thoughts once a month from here on,\ngiving Tim's fingers and brain a chance to recharge ... and giving us a\nchance to ad-lib things a little bit.  For my part, I hope you enjoy my\nideas, but whether you do or not, all comments are welcome - just reply to\nthis letter, or give me a shout at mike@cabotwealth.com\n\n-----\n\nFor this issue of the CWA, I'm going to attempt to provide something every\nreader wants - methods and tools that can make you a better investor, and\nhence, will help you make more money over time.  Now, I could list off a\ncouple of top-notch stocks, but heck, Tim does that in most issues.  So in\nthis space I'm going to chat about a couple of newer, unique investment\nvehicles, and one little-followed investment tool, that are great ways to\naccumulate profits.\n\nFair warning:  The first topic I'm going to write about concerns\nincome-oriented securities.  If you're a true-blue growth-stock investor,\nskip down to the next section.  But if you're a bit older, maybe looking\nfor a couple of higher-yielding ideas, stick around.  \n\nI'm not even 30 years young at this point, so I still have a shred of that\nyouthful exuberance we all start life with.  And that means my investments\ntend to be aggressive, figuring I've got plenty of time (God willing!) to\nmake up for most monetary stumbles.  However, things do change, and as I\nmove through life (I just got engaged two and a half weeks ago!) I realize\nthose conservative old fogies I used to snicker at actually had some great\nideas, after all.\n\nEven so, most bond-type investments don't appeal to me.  In my mind, I can\nget 5% in a zero-risk money market fund.  So what's the use of jumping\ninto a bond that yields, say, 6%?  Am I really going to lock my money into\nsomething that gives me an extra 1%?  No thank you.\n\nYet with the advent of exchange traded funds (dubbed ETFs), some new,\ninnovative high-yielding stuff has come on the market, including a batch\nof covered call funds.  These are basically mutual funds that invest in a\nbunch of big, steady, dividend-paying companies, and then sell call\noptions against their holdings.  For the uninitiated, selling a call\noption means you're \"betting\" the stock will fall ... but by owning the\nunderlying stock, you're also \"betting\" the stock will rise.  The result\nis a hedged position, where you're collecting money by selling the call\noption, but also having a chance of participating in some upside.\n\nIndustry jargon aside, the bottom line is that some very respectable fund\ncompanies offer these covered call funds (Eaton Vance, Blackstone, Nuveen,\netc.), most pay dividends monthly or quarterly, and most have annual\nyields in the 8% to 10% range (before taxes).  Of course, the funds\nthemselves trade like stocks, and they can rise and fall depending on the\nmarket, or interest rates.  In other words, there's no free lunch.  \n\nEven so, these funds provide a steady stream of income over time, using a\nmethod (covered-call writing) that's been proven to work for many years. \nSo if you're looking for a solid, higher-yielding income investment, give\nthem a look; some of the symbols include JLA, JSN, EOS and EEF, but there\nare many others.  I believe many income-seeking investors would benefit by\nputting some money to work there.\n\n---\n\n>From the world of income-oriented securities, we now switch gears to\nmarket timing, a subject that's  near and dear to my heart ... but is\nunloved by many investors.  Of course, any major fund company's sales\nletter will tell you that timing the market is nearly impossible.  That,\nmy friends, is a total lie.  What they really mean is that huge, unwieldy\nmutual funds, which take weeks to build and sell off positions because of\ntheir massive amount of funds, can't time the market.  But you, the\nnimble, intelligent individual investor, can easily time the market ... if\nyou're looking at the right indicators.\n\nReally, though, my experience is that many investors aren't interested in\nmarket timing for two basic reasons.  The first is that they don't believe\nthey can make big money doing so.  Honestly, there used to be some truth\nto that.  After all, if you buy the Dow at a market bottom, you might make\nsomething like 10% or 15% during the next advance.  Not bad, but not\nexactly the cat's meow, either.\n\nBut recently, new investment vehicles dubbed ProShares have hit the\nmarket.  The cool thing about these:  They are leveraged to a bunch of\ndifferent major market indexes.  Said another way, you can buy an ETF that\nmoves as much as twice the Dow ... or buy one that moves the opposite of\ntwice the Dow!  For instance, if you purchase the Dow leveraged fund\n(symbol DDM), it will generally go up about 2% every time the Dow goes up\n1%.  And the reverse is true; it will fall 2% should the Dow lose 1% of\nits value.  It's not exact, but in general, it's close.\n\nStill, maybe the Dow is too slow-moving for you.  That's okay, because\nthere are ProShares that track the S&P 500 (SSO), the S&P MidCap 400 (MVV)\nand even the volatile Nasdaq 100 (QLD).  There are also plenty of\nindustry-specific leveraged ProShares funds, though many of these aren't\nnearly as liquid as the index-based ones.  Bottom line:  If you're\naggressive enough, you can make good money by timing the market ... if\nyou're following the right indicators.\n\nWhich brings us to the second reason most investors gloss over market\ntiming ... it's hard to do.  The fact is, market timing is difficult\nbecause it's so contrary in nature; just as the news gets really bad (and\nafter you've suffered a few weeks of painful losses), the market usually\nturns up ... and when all the news is good, the country is doing great and\nyou're making good money, the market usually turns down.\n\nPut another way, if you time the market without a set of rules or\nindicators, you'll never do it well, because your emotions will lead you\nastray.  That's why, at Cabot, we rely on a choice few time-tested\nindicators to keep us in the loop.  One of our best indicators:  the Cabot\nTides, which determines the market's intermediate-term trend of the market\nby watching the movement of five of the market's major indexes (S&P 500,\nNasdaq, NYSE Composite, S&P 600 SmallCap and the Merrill Lynch 100 Tech\nIndex).  \n\nIt's not rocket science; the Tides just examine these indexes in relation\nto their 25-day and 50-day moving averages.  Basically, when most of the\nindexes are above the lines, it means the trend is up; a decisive break\nbelow the lines, and it means the trend is down.  The results have been\nterrific:  our last few signals have been a buy in October 2005 (great), a\nsell in mid-May 2006 (excellent), a buy in mid-August 2006 (excellent), a\nsell in late-February of this year (not good) ... and we just got a new\nbuy signal on April 4.  \n\nCombined with some other indicators we're written about (Tim talked about\nthe Volume Blast-Off Indicator three weeks ago), the Tides are telling me\nthat an investment in some of these leveraged ProShares could turn a tidy\nprofit over the next couple of months.\n\n----- Advertisement -----\n\nIntroducing Cabot Stock of the Month\n\nA revolutionary investment advisory that brings you Wall Street's top\nopportunity on a monthly basis, directly from the editors of Cabot Market\nLetter, Cabot Top Ten Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and\nCabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.\n\nTry It Risk Free for the Next 12 Months - Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!\n\nTo learn more, please visit this link:\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/158141/13148861/86/0/\n\n------\n\nLastly, I wanted to share with you a timely tool that will help you find\nsome big-winning stocks.  (And, yes, I'll give you a stock that looks\nbuyable here.)  The tool is earnings gaps ... visible in the charts of\nstocks that have just soared (or plunged) the day after their earnings\nreports.  Now, you might think that stocks that have exploded higher on\ntheir earnings are good sells; after all, the market usually overreacts,\nso anything that moves up so quickly is likely to retrace its steps,\nright?\n\nWrong.  Our studies have shown that if you have a stock with a good story\nand good numbers, and if the market is generally looking fine (like now),\nbuying it as it gaps up 10%, 15% or more on earnings is actually the way\nto go.  No joke!  I know what you're thinking ... that's it's too late to\nbuy after such a big move.  I thought the same thing when we began looking\ninto this phenomenon.  But my experience is that, seven out of ten times,\na stock will move higher in the weeks following a very strong earnings\nmove.\n\nThe reasoning is sound; when you see a stock soar 20% after a blowout\nearnings report, it's telling you that perception among the big-money\ncrowd (mutual funds, pension funds, etc.) has instantly changed for the\nbetter.  And because these funds take weeks to finish building a position,\nthe stock will usually continue higher following its strong move.\n\nA recent example is GameStop (GME), a company I refer to as the King of\nVideo Games, which was featured in Cabot Top Ten last week.  \nFundamentally, GameStop is five-star material, as it's guaranteed to\nbenefit from all the new consoles (Nintendo Wii, Playstation 3, the new\nMicrosoft Xbox, etc.) that have been and will be introduced.  And it\nrecently digested the acquisition of Electronics Boutique, making it the\nundisputed #1 player in the industry, with nearly 5,000 stores worldwide.\n\nThat set the stage for the firm's recent earnings report.  The numbers\nwere a bit better than expected, but what wowed the market were\nmanagement's comments.  CEO R. Richard Fontaine stated, \"While we are in\nthe very early stages of another strong growth cycle, it is not a mirror\nof the past. In fact, our 2007 guidance is based on our belief that this\ncycle will be deeper, wider, and longer than any previous period of new\nconsole introductions. From the technology powerhouses of Xbox 360 and\nPS3, to the uniquely engaging ease of play and inventiveness of the Wii,\nto the portability of the DS Lite, to the value of the PS2, there is a\nproduct and a price range to stimulate the core and casual gamer, and\nattract new customers to the video game experience.  No previous cycle has\nhad the diversity of console attributes currently in our stores; no\nprevious cycle has merged other technologies like HDTV, Wi-Fi, and MP3\nattributes to make the gaming experience truly the best ever.\"\n\nAs for numbers, Fontaine predicted 40% earnings growth this year, and 25%\ngrowth in both 2008 and 2009.  The result:  GME gapped up and out of a\nlong consolidation, soaring 11.4% the day after results on volume that was\na whopping five times its average.  (Read:  Big investors were buying a\nton.)  It's since moved up another couple of points, but I don't believe\nit's nearly done.  You could buy a little here, or try to grab some on\nnormal weakness.\n\nWhat are the common characteristics of earnings gap ups that fail?  Most\ncommon are those that come when the market is trending down.  Second are\nthose that come after the stock has already enjoyed a big run-up the past\nfew months.  So, just FYI, your odds aren't as good if you're looking at a\nstock that's moved straight up the past few months, and then soars on\nearnings.\n\nAnyway, with earnings season now upon us (we saw a big negative gap from\nResearch in Motion last week ... not good), keep your eyes open for\nquality stocks that are gapping meaningfully higher (10% or more) on their\nearnings reports.  They're fairly easy to spot (just look for the big\nmovers each day), and they can provide you with some good gains in quick\nfashion.  \n\nThat's all for this week.  Until next time, best of luck, and don't forget\nto write me with any comments or questions you may have.\n\nMike Cintolo\nFor Cabot Wealth Advisory\n\nEditor's note: Mike Cintolo is the Editor of the Cabot Top Ten Report,\nand Vice President of Investments, for Cabot Heritage Corporation.\n\nEven when the broad market is weak, there are always some stocks going up,\nand the best way to find them, and to learn why they're so strong, is to\nread Cabot Top Ten Report, which every Monday shoots an email to your\ninbox detailing the fundamental and technical facts behind the ten\nstrongest stocks in the market.
