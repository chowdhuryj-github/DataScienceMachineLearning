This was necessary because Devel::Cover was gagging on running \ntests within tests.\n\nTested in both trunk and reconfigure branch; results in same %\nParrot::Config::Generated::PConfig as regular configuration.  Should have no impact if you \nchoose not to use one or another variant of the '--test' option to Configure.pl.\n\n"}
