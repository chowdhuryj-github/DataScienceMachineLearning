I have three sets of numeral data, 2 sets are paired and a \nthird is independent of the other two. For each of these sets I have \nobtained their basic statistics (mean, median, stdv, range ...). \nNow I want to compare if these sets differ. I could compare the mean \ndoing a basic T test . However, I was looking for a test to compare \nthe medians using R.   If that is possible I would love to hear the \nspecifics.\nThanks in advance for any help,\nRegards,\n\n\npedro reche\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide \nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n\n\n============================================================================================\nDISCLAIMER AND CONFIDENTIALITY CAUTION:\\ \\ This message and ...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
