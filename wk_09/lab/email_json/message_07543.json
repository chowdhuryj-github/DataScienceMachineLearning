While we should (note\nshould, not must) purge the preamble from packages which contain the GPL\nwhere it is not needed for the distribution of the package, it remains\nbecause other parts of our promise are equally important.\n\nThis doesn't make licence texts an exception to our rules, but an example\nof how to handle conflict in our promise without giving free rein to all\nabuses.  The rest of the 'slippery slope' posted vanishes as a result of\nremoving the false dichotomy.  Sorry it's grey, not black or white for you.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
