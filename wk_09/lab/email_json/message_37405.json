Ask Patrick about his experiences writing the initial version of \nPGE in C sometime. I certainly wouldn't want to write TGE in straight C. \nSometimes a layer of abstraction can make such a large difference in how \neasy it is to tackle a problem, that it's just not worth the hassle of \ndoing it without the layer of abstraction.\n\nAllison\n\n"}
