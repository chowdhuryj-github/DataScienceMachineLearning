However, if you go without an initrd, make sure that things\nlike your ide/sata chipset, and hd support and the root file system\nyou use are built into the kernel itself, else you won't be able to\nboot. Then, install kernel-package, untar the kernel sources, run make\noldconfig/config/menuconfig, and then run\n\nmake-kpkg kernel_image.\n\nIf you were building in /usr/src/linux for example, then the resulting\ndeb will be in /usr/src. Then, install it with dpkg -i package.deb,\nwhere package.deb is the file kernel-package created. Then you'll need\nto add the new image to your boot loader, this may or may not be done\nfor you when you install the package. I'd strongly suggest keeping\nyour current kernel in the boot loader as well, so that you can boot\nback with it if your new kernel panics and doesn't boot. Then reboot.\n\nIf the new kernel works like you'd expect, then you can remove your\nold kernel from your system, and from the boot loader of course as\nwell.\n\nThis is a very brief description, there are howtos and docs on the web\nthat cover this in much more detail.\n\nGreg\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jun 06, 2007 at 11:58:04AM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hiya,\n>     In that case, I can probably roll my own kernel as well.
