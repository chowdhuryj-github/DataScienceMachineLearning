In samba4 we started having a style convention shortly\nafter the branch was created (not sure we always followed that though).\n\nI am all for setting a style convention, it makes the code much more\nreadable. And I am ok with the kernel convention (which is roughly what\nwe have in samba4 and afaics very close to what we use in samba3).\n\nsimo.\n\n-- \nSimo Sorce\nSamba Team GPL Compliance Officer\nemail: idra@samba.org\nhttp://samba.org\n\n"}
