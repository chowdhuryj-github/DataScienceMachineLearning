So I tried to allay that particular concern.\n\n> So the question really is: how can we have Bacula in Debian, with SSL\n> support, but without that clause?\n\nMake Bacula use GnuTLS.  Unfortunately, that may take some effort.\nDownloading the 2.0.3 release, it seems that bacula uses the headers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this page\n\n  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/comparison.html\n\nGnuTLS + libgcrypt + libtasn1 implements everything unless you need\nECC.\n\n> And why does FSFE disagree with our interpretation?\n\nMichael Poole gave a good answer.\n\nCheers,\nWalter Landry\nwlandry@ucsd.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
