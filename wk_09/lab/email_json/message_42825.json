Since it is not in \nthe Adobe symbol encoding it is not accessible via plotmath.\n\nIt is Unicode character U+2113, and so on UTF-8 R systems you may well be \nable to enter it as \\u2113 and get it plotted on-screen in a suitable \nfont.  But we'd need to know a lot more about your system to advise on how \nexactly to do so.\n\n-- \nBrian D.
