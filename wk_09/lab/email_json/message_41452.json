I tried this and didn't succeed.\nOrca and Speakup both need the Festival server running, and that is \nmaybe what causes the trouble.\nDo you use Ubuntu 7.04? If so, you can use Orca with Espeak.\nSwitch to it in the orca speech settings by choosing Espeak as speech \nsynthesizer.\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
