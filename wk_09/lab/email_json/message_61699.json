Specific constraints, \nincluding one on the residual variance can be specified in sas proc mixed. In my \nmodel I want to fix the residual variance to the known value of 0. If anyone \nhaving an idea about that, I would appreciate letting me know.\n\nThanks Toby\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
