The internet is littered with protests about this model, which I should have read before purchasing.  Anyway, if I hold it's reset button for about three seconds, it sends settings to the attached printer.  This didn't work with our USB printer but I found my old faithful HP paper muncher DJ400.  Anyway the IP is: 169.254.25.233.  Using the Ethernet port, I cannot connect to it.  It is also wireless but its SSID is different to that of our network.  So how do I get in on 169.254.25.233 and take control of this beast?\n\nThe printout also states that it has a email server, who's IP is 0.0.0.0, uuuhhhhh!\n\nGena\n\nAmateur Call: M 0 E B P\n\nVOIP / IM: gena1959uk\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
