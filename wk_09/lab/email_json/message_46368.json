I'm wondering whether there is a  \nlibrary available in R that includes algorithms for \"archetypal  \nanalysis\"? This is a method quite similar to principal components  \nanalysis that is designed to find \"archetypes\" or \"pure types\" from  \nmultidimensional data.\n\nAny help from you is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\nJuan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
