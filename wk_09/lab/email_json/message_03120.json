Suppose I have two time series of spot prices of two commodities X and Y for two years. Now I want to see what percentage of spot price of X is explained by Y. Yes I can fit a regression equation of X on Y. But my question is, is it legitimate? Because both series are non-stationary with very high auto-correlation of order 1. And regression analysis is basically designed for cross-sectional data, not for time series data.\n  \n Your help will be highly appreciable.\n  \n Thanks and regards,\n Ron\n\n\n Send instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
