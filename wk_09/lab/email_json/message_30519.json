Beginning with\nlme4_0.99875-0, which was uploaded today, the Laplace approximation is\nthe default method for generalized linear mixed models.\n\nIt would be simplest to use\n\nlmer(success ~ yearF + (1|bandnumb), quality, binomial)\n\n\n> On 5/15/07, Stefan Grosse  wrote:\n> > the lme4 function you want is probably lmer()\n> > type\n> > ?lmer\n> >\n> > btw. your R is very old we are at 2.5.0 ...\n> >\n> > Stefan\n> >\n> > Amelie LESCROEL wrote:\n> > > Hi - I'm having a problem trying to use the function GLMM() from lme4.
