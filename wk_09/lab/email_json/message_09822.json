I would like to know a lot more \ndetail about the function than written in the documentation at\nhttp://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/stats/html/cor.test.html\nto see if this would do the job?\n\nI would gratefully appreciate any help you can offer me on these two interlinked \nissues,\n\nMany thanks for your time and consideration,\n\nJenny\n\nPS. If you would like more detail I have two arrays both of dimensions \n[31,31,43]. 31x31 is latitude and longitude, 43 is years of rainfall data. I \nhave produced a spearmans rank correlation map of these 2 arrays over this 43 \nyear period. I now need to find the significance for each of the 31x31 grid \npoints........\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJennifer Barnes\nPhD student: long range drought prediction \nClimate Extremes Group\nDepartment of Space and Climate Physics\nUniversity College London\nHolmbury St Mary \nDorking, Surrey, RH5 6NT\nTel: 01483 204149\nMob: 07916 139187\nWeb: http://climate.mssl.ucl.ac.uk\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
