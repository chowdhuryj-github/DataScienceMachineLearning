OK\n* checking R code for possible problems ... OK\n* checking Rd files ... OK\n* checking Rd cross-references ... WARNING\nError in .find.package(package, lib.loc) :\n        there is no package called 'rcompgen'\nExecution halted\n* checking for missing documentation entries ... OK\n* checking for code/documentation mismatches ... OK\n* checking Rd \\usage sections ... OK\n\n\n\nI am informed: There is no package called 'rcompgen'.  True;\nI never knew there was one, so I certainly never asked for\nit to be loaded.  (I can search all the files in the package directory\nand the string  rcompgen  never appears either, and nor does the\nstring  find.package.)  So somewhere, this package must be deemed \nnecessary to install.  (I have checked all dependencies too: none of\nthose packages need  rcompgen  either.)\n\nI can get this package from CRAN and install it of course, but I\ndon't think I need it.  (Not that I fully understand what it is for\nor what it does...).  I'm sure it implies there is a problem in\nmy package, but i don't know what problem that is.\n\nSo can anyone help me:  Why does R think I need package  rcompgen?\nWhat error/mistake in my Rd files would invoke this?  Where should\nI be looking, and what sort of problem might I be looking for?\n\nThanks as always.\n\nP.\n\n-- \nDr Peter Dunn  |  dunn  usq.edu.au\nFaculty of Sciences, USQ; http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/dunn\nAust.
