It does this by using freely (as in no cost) available dlls\nthat come with internet exploder. You do need x to use wine. The\nreason I say it's an emulator of sorts, is because you don't install a\nversion of windows on it like you do on a virtual machine, wine is\nwindows, if that makes sense. The whole point of wine is to run\nwindows software, without having to install a copy of windows, and\nworry about the licensing that doing so entails. You can find out more\nabout wine at:\n\nhttp://www.winehq.org\n\nHth.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Sun, Apr 15, 2007 at 04:32:24PM -0400, Chris Schulte wrote:\n> Hi all,\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'm going to be getting a junker system in august, and the only reason that\n> I'm taking it is because the price, (free) is right.
