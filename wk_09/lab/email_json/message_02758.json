Send it in...\"\n\nThere is a reason why SAS is the largest privately held software company\nin the world and it is not due to the academic licensing structure,\nwhich constitutes only about 12% of their revenue, based upon their\npublic figures.\n\nSince SPSS is mentioned, it also functions using similar economic\nmodels...\n\n:-)\n\nRegards,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
