But now I prescribe my patients\na natural alternative with no side effects.\n\n\nIt safely reduces cholesterol absorption by \n\n40% or more, clinical tests show.\n\nAsk your doctor if he's heard about it yet, \nbecause drugs like Lipitor(r), Zocor(r), Crestor(r)\nand the other statins can cause a whole\nnew set of problems. In fact...\n\nThe most common question on our Customer\nCare Hotline is, \"Will I be able to \n\ndiscontinue\ntaking statins?\"\n\nYes, many patients get their prescriptions cut\nor even discontinued after just a few months.\nSo ask your doctor to let you try this new \nsafe, natural alternative. It really works. \n\nBut\nplease follow your doctor's advice, and don't\nstop taking any prescription until you get your\nphysician's okay.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr Arlene Donar\nMedical Director\nCholesterolWatchers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are subscribed to dinkingearldineweb.net with the email address kahlia@speedy.uwaterloo.ca.\nIf you wish to be excluded from future dinkingearldineweb.net mailings,\nplease click here\nor write us at:\n287 S.
