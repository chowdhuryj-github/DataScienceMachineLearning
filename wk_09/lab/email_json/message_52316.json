Lots of things other than Perl 5 have\nbeen documented with POD, so lets continue to make this kind of thing\neasier.\n\n> And why do you want easy to remove docs?\n\nI didn't mean remove them for human (non-)consumption, but filtering\nthem out from, say, a shell script so that what remains is a\nsyntactically valid script which can be run in the shell.\n\n> Other languages already have their own documentation system. Why do\n> you expect them to use POD6?\n\nMost people won't.  But that's no reason to make it hard.\n\nSmylers\n\n"}
