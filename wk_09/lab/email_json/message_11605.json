I enjoyed working here and working with the excellent crews and commanders,\" Simonyi said during a farewell ceremony erlier this morning. \"I'm looking forward to the return flight. It is a bittersweet moment for all of us. We are very sad leaving the station but at the same time looking forward to continuing our work on Earth.\"\n\nIf all goes well, the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft will fire its braking rockets at 7:42:30 a.m. for four minutes and 18 seconds, slowing the craft's 5-mile-per-second velocity by about 258 mph. That's just enough to drop the craft into the atmosphere on a trajectory leading to a landing zone in Kazakhstan where Russian recovery forces will be standing by to greet the returning spacemen.\n\nHere is a timeline of today's events (in EDT):\n\nEDT...........EVENT\n\n05:11:30 AM - Physical separation (dV: 0.27 mph)\n05:14:30 AM - Soyuz separation burn No. 1 (15-second burn; velocity change: 1.45 mph)\n05:16:30 AM - Space station attitude control re-enabled\n\n07:42:30 AM - Deorbit ignition (planned velocity change: 257.7 mph)\n07:46:48 AM - Deorbit burn complete\n\n08:05:37 AM - Soyuz TMA-9 module separation\n08:08:29 AM - Soyuz descent module hits the discernible atmosphere at 400,000 feet\n08:10:03 AM - Entry guidance begins\n08:14:14 AM - Maximum deceleration\n08:16:33 AM - Parachute deploy command\n08:30:34 AM - Landing\n10:23:00 AM - Sunset at landing site\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nNASA ISS-15 Crew Page:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition15/index.html\n\nNASA ISS-14 Crew Page:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/index.html\n\nCharles Simonyi:\nhttp://www.charlesinspace.com\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
