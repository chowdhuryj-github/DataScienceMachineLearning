You\ncan get Perl to represent all your /floating-point/ constants as Math::BigFloat\nobjects by changing the use line to\n\n  use Math::BigFloat ':constant';\n\nwhich makes\n\n  $n = 0.0;\n  if ($n->is_zero) {print 'you entered zero'}\n\nwork as you expected.\n\nHTH,\n\nRob\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
