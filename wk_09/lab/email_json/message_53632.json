Usually,\n    hidden variables are set by the site you're working on for a\n    reason. If you change the value, you might be breaking some\n    functionality by faking it out.\n\n    If you really do want to change a hidden value, make the\n    changes in a scope that has warnings turned off:\n\n    {\n      local $^W = 0;\n      $agent->field( name => $value );\n    }\n\nI found the FAQ here:\n\n    http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/lib/WWW/Mechanize/FAQ.pod\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
