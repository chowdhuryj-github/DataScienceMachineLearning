Perhaps a bit too pointed, as CCP's internal affairs\ninvestigation claims that [1]a plot to smear the company with false\naccusations over the long holiday weekend was behind the flurry of online\nactivity. \"The objective of this scheme was to permanently paint CCP as a\nbiased and corrupt company that favors a select group of players over the\nrest of our community. In this particular case, instead of receiving\nnotification of a possible problem and sufficient time to examine and\naddress it, we faced a coordinated and hostile attack executed on our\nforums, Digg, Wikipedia, Slashdot, and other outlets at the beginning of\na three-day weekend. We believe this speaks volumes of the intention of\nthe person(s) responsible for orchestrating this scheme.

The team hopes that\nthis insight will provide them a better look inside the dynamics of space\nweather. \"Because helium nearly vanishes from the solar wind at its\nminimum speed, the researchers believe helium might somehow set the\nminimum speed. Helium is not accelerated efficiently by any process\nthought to be propelling the solar wind. Instead, it has to be dragged\nalong by the hydrogen: Solar wind hydrogen atoms exert a small electric\nfield that drags the helium out along with it, according to the team.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/30/170241\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070530114957.htm\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| It's Not News, It's Fark                                           |\n|   from the all-spin-zone dept.                                     |\n|   posted by samzenpus on Wednesday May 30, @14:27 (Book Reviews)   |\n|   http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/29/1718214        |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\"In It's Not News, It's Fark, Drew Curtis takes a critical look at the\nmass media.

Drew breaks down these not-news\nstories into 8 separate categories and gives examples, along with user\ncomments from Fark. Unfortunately, 230 of the books 278 pages (including\nthe index) are used for these examples.
