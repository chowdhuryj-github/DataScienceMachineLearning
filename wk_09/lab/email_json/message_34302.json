My understanding is that you\nsuspect the should-be-quoted fields (factor or character fields)\ncontains tabs.\n\nif this is the case,  count.fields()  should detect the tab,\nread.table(sep=\"t\\\") should read with the same awareness, and if\nwrite.table(sep\"\\t\") write and seperate with tab those fields as\nacknowldged by read.table(sep=\"t\\\"), the two field counts should be\nthe same.\n\nanyway, I will try to redo it per your suggestion.\n\nRegards\nyong\n\n\nOn 5/22/07, Prof Brian Ripley  wrote:\n> If you write out unquoted fields, how do you know they do not contain\n> tabs?\n>\n> The default is quote=TRUE for a good reason.\n>\n> On Tue, 22 May 2007, Yong Wang wrote:\n>\n> > Dear all:\n> >\n> > I read in a tab delimited dataset, and then write it out as another\n> > file as following: I did this simply to make sure I understand the\n> > behavior of this command.\n> >\n> > data<-read.table(file,header=F,sep=\"\\t\",fill=T,colClasses=\"character\");\n> > write.table(data,file=\"newdata.txt\",eol=\"\\n\",sep=\"\\t\",quote=F,row.names=F);\n> >\n> >\n> > cf1 <- count.fields(newdata.txt, sep=\"\\t\")\n> > table(cf1)\n> > 13   17       23\n> > 10   126   5445\n> >\n> > # is different to\n> >\n> > cf2 <- count.fields(file,sep=\"\\t\")\n> > 13   17       23        33\n> > 10   106   5433      32\n> >\n> > the worst problem is the maximal value of cf1 (33) is larger than the\n> > maximal value of cf2 (23) which is the right number of fields for most\n> > rows in the original file.\n> >\n> > I need to use write.table for some important data manipulation work,\n> > your suggestion is\n> > highly appreciated.\n> >\n> > Best Regards\n> >\n> > ______________________________________________\n> > R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> > https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> > PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> > and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> >\n>\n> --\n> Brian D.
