In addition (I see) a unwise development of operating systems (at least\nMS) sets higher and higher requirements for the machine (which of course is not\nthe R's fault)\n\nFor the future, would it be possible to build a data/object file system parallel\nto R workspace in which you typically could avoid loading all the data into use\nmemory. So to have a very scalable solution to the painful memory problem.\nI am using R in a strong relationship with a Finnish statistical system\n\"Survo\" (www.survo.fi) In the C-programmed Survo the data or matrix files are\nusually never wholly loaded into memory. Minimally you can load just one element\nfrom the data file (via C-function) into memory\n(e.g. for calculating some statistics).\n\nOf course in that way (since the data is not in fast memory) the operations are\nslower compared to operating with R objects. But the other (and important) side\nof the coin is that the size of free hard disk space is practically the only\nlimit in Survo (of course some methods (for computational reasons) require a\nloading of bigger part of the data into fast memory).\n\nI also see that a marriage with some database system or data warehouse can\nsometimes cause a creative analysis work a bit clumsy.\n\nExample: How I have used R within Survo variable transformations. In this way\nyou don't need to load all the data into R workspace (just the vectors of\ninterest).\n\nA small example data in Survo editor where all the operations are done:\n\nDATA _TMP1\nX   Y\n1   A\n2   A\n3   B\n4   B\n5   B\n\nFILE COPY _TMP1 TO TMP1 / copy to Survo data file\n\nFILE STATUS TMP1  / Structure of data\n Copy of data matrix _TMP1\nFIELDS: (active)\n   1 NA_   1 X        (#)\n   2 SA_   1 Y\nEND\nSurvo data file TMP1: record=22 bytes, M1=6 L=64  M=2 N=5\n\n\nVariable transformations:\n\nCASE 1: Survo's own VAR operation\n\nVAR X2=log(X) TO TMP1 / Activation in the editor\n\nFILE LOAD TMP1\nDATA TMP1*\n X Y          X2\n 1 A       0.000\n 2 A       0.693\n 3 B       1.099\n 4 B       1.386\n 5 B       1.609\n\n\nCASE 2: Identical VAR operation via R function\n(using a sucro tehcnique (~macro) in Survo)\n\n/R_VAR X2b=c(log(TMP1$X)) TO TMP1 / for your comments etc.\n\nFILE LOAD TMP1   /  see if the equal results ;)\nDATA TMP1*\n X Y          X2         X2b\n 1 A       0.000       0.000\n 2 A       0.693       0.693\n 3 B       1.099       1.099\n 4 B       1.386       1.386\n 5 B       1.609       1.609\n\n\nwhere /R_VAR is the sucro (I haven't listed the code here) carrying out the\n\"visit\" in R workspace (log()) and then returning the output vector into Survo\ndata file TMP1. Perhaps any R script that results a vector of the data\nrow dim can be used as an argument for this simple sucro function.\n\nI'm very excited about data processing with R. I see my approach just to\nunion the strengths of these two programs. Sometimes with larger data I do\nthe pre-processing mainly with Survo and then the final analyses (e.g. lmer())\nin R perhaps in connection with a database \n(though Survo covers a wide set of statistical operations, the matrix\ninterpreter is great and it's easy do your C-modules for Survo).\n\nPerhaps this all is also possible with SAS or SPSS (\"I my opinion SPSS is inconvienent\nand SAS I have never used but heard that it's at least overpriced\" ;-)\n\nBest regards,\nPetri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Prof Brian Ripley\nSent: 17. huhtikuuta 2007 11:19\nTo: Uwe Ligges\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] It is possible to Expand RAM with HD space?\n\nOn Tue, 17 Apr 2007, Uwe Ligges wrote:\n\n>\n>\n> Jorge Cornejo-Donoso wrote:\n>> I'm using R in a winXp machine.

And anyone using less than 2GB RAM at current prices (except perhaps on a laptop) and is running out of RAM needs to buy some more: *far* cheaper than buying SAS.\n\n\n>\n> Uwe Ligges\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>> I'm trying to make a variogram, and I don't want to sacrifice the \n>> precision of the data, e.g. using mean or median by defined pixels or \n>> something like that (now I have to do that, or use other software like SAS).\n>>\n>> Thanks in advance!\n>>\n>> ______________________________________________\n>> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list \n>> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n>> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n>> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n>> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n--\nBrian D.
