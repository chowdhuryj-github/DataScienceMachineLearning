Or I can use the normalized eigen vector to reconstruct the cointegrated relationship series. However, since the package can plot that for me, I wonder is there any specific slot/method in the class from where I can invoke to get this relationship instead of doing a duplicated work? Thank you.\n\n- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
