However, I get only\nzero probabilities.\n\nThis code works in low dimensions (tried 2 and 3 already).  I have run\ninto many implementations that do not work in high dimension, but I\nthought that I was safe with dmnorm because it has an option to\ncompute the log of the probability.\n\nSo, is dmnorm not intended to be used with data of such high dimensionality?\n\nThank you,\n\ndan elliott\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
