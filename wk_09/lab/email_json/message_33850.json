The SAS result is calculating without any preprocessing of data.\nUnfortunately, the pls package has no easy option to turn data centering off. If you really want to turn it off, you must comment corresponding lines in for example simpls.fit:\n     Xmeans <- colMeans(X)     X <- X - rep(Xmeans, each = nobj)     Ymeans <- colMeans(Y)     Y <- Y - rep(Ymeans, each = nobj)\nI do not know what is your data, but you probably WANT to center them around the column means. The uncentered version of PLS, PCR and other multivariate regression can be considered only if all columns of X are in the same unit and there is no expected intercept term (for example spectral data). Any other approach requires at least centering. If you fit uncentered version, you should compare its RMSEP with centered and choose better variant.\nRegards,\nLukasz\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
