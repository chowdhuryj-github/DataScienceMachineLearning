A PCA on this [20\nrows/observations by ~ 500 columns/descriptors/variables] should return ~\n500 eigenvalues.  And each of these columns/descriptors/variables will have\na loading on each PC.\n\nJames wants to reduce his descriptors/measurements/variables to the \"most\nimportant\" (variance).  A primitive way of doing this would be to examine\nthe loadings on the first 2--3 PCs and choose those\ncolumns/descriptors/variables with the highest loadings, and throw away the\nrest.  [He has already decided that he can throw away all but the first two\nPCs.]  In fact, it would be a very good idea to do a coinertia analysis on\nthe pre- and post-selected sets, and look at the RV value.  If this is above\n[thumbsuck] 0.9, then you're doing very well (there's a good plot method for\nthis in ade4, cf coinertia &c).\n\nBut see Cadima et al. (+refs for caution; and elsewhere) for more\nsophisticated methods of subsetting.\n\nRegards,\nMark.\n\n\nRavi Varadhan wrote:\n> \n> Mark,\n> \n> What you are referring to deals with the selection of covariates, since PC\n> doesn't do dimensionality reduction in the sense of covariate selection.\n> But what Mark is asking for is to identify how much each data point\n> contributes to individual PCs.
