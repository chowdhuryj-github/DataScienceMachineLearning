If it pexp() \ngives 1, then qnorm produces \"Inf\".\n\nYour suggestion is very helpful. In my case, I'll jsut simply use \n-qnorm(pexp(..., lower.tail=FALSE)).\n\nAll the best,\n\nJeann\n\n\n>From: \"Spielas Bates\" \n>To: \"Jeann S\" \n>CC: R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n>Subject: Re: [R] Help with pexp( )\n>Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2007 14:14:17 -0500\n>\n>On 4/11/07, Jeann S  wrote:\n>>Dear all,\n>>\n>>Sorry for bringing up an old issue:\n>>\n>>     >pexp(50, 0.5)\n>>     [1] 1\n>>\n>>In some cases, pexp()  gives CDF=1.
