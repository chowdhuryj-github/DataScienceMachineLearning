I want to find a function that can simply add\n\"C:\\inFiles\\\" into R's search path, so that we I scan a file R will go to\nall the search paths to find it. In matlab, path(path,\"C:\\inFiles\") will do\nthis job, I'm just wondering if there is a similar function in R can do this\njob.\n\nThanks,\nzhiliang\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
