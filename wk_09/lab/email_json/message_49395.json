If the cables all seem \nokay I the next thing to check would be if the BIOS is seeing \nthe drive. On modern BIOS the drives will usually be set to \nauto but if you press F8 it will detect the drives and show you \nthem in BIOS (may be a different function key for a different\nBIOS). Confirm that BIOS is seeing the drive, and showing it\nas master, then check the boot priority settings in BIOS to \nmake sure IDE0 is in the boot priority list. There are also \nsettings in BIOS for the hard drive DMA mode, the lowest \nmode being PIO0, which is original IDE. If still not booting\ntry setting that the lowest possible mode. The highest mode\nis probably PIO5 or Ultra DMA, or UDMA 133.\n\nAt this point, after checking BIOS, if it sees the drive as \nmaster, IDE0 is in the boot list, the DMA mode is lowest\nPIO0, and it still won't boot, I would suggest putting it \nback in the original machine and making sure it boots.\n\nIf it doesn't boot there I would check the partition table \nusing fdisk or cfdisk or similar, check the bootable flag and \nmake sure a partition is marked as bootable, and it's the \ncorrect partition, the one with grub installed. You can do\nthis by booting from a linux CD and running fdisk -l or\ncfdisk.\n\nIf BIOS on target system is seeing the drive as master and\nthe drive will boot in original machine, then I'd say its time\nto try a different drive in target motherboard to make sure\nthe IDE controller is working okay.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
