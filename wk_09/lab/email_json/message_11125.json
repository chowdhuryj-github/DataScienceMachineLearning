I have 6 gpr files that  \napparently are not compatible with limma. Everytime I'm trying to load  \nthe data (including a RNA targets file, an error appears:Error reading  \nfiles. that I'm not sure,but seems to have something to do with the  \nformat of my files (gpr).\nIs that the problem? does anyone have any idea what it could be?\nI was wondering if I try GAL files, the problem would be solved. I  \nstill don't have access to the gal files that's why I haven't tried it  \nyet.\n\nThanks,\nSolmaz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
