How could I \napply a function f(a,r,c) on each element of A, using the subscript (row \nand column) of a as the other arguments?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarkku Karhunen\nNational Public Health Institute,\nFinland\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
