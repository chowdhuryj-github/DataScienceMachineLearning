The problem only should up with the 2.6.20\nkernels.  Whether the debian patches brought that kernel up to an\naffective 2.6.20 kernel I don't know.  The problem only shows up at\nload time when it can't locate the DECTalk Express because of\ninterrupt handler changes of some sort.\n\n  Kirk\n\n-- \n\nKirk Reiser\t\t\t\tThe Computer Braille Facility\ne-mail: kirk@braille.uwo.ca\t\tUniversity of Western Ontario\nphone: (519) 661-3061\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
