I have this error:\n\nattempt to find suitable starting values failed\n\nI wonder what would be an appropriate way to solve this problem? I can try to specify some random starting value but I am afraid that it will cause the MLE to stuck at some local maxima. Is there anyway to cope with this in a more elegant way? Any help would be really appreciated. Thank you.\n\n- adschai\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
