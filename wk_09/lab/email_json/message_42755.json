I would say\nthat I have the right to not be *slandered* on a list that I'm not\nsubscribed to; given the trends toward globalization and data mining of\ncitizens, I wouldn't assume at all that a default judgement against me in\nsome foreign land is equivalent to an unseen flame instead of an unseen\nslander.\n\n-- \nSteve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\nDebian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\nvorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
