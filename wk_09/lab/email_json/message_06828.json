In particular does\nit support opening a file as a directory for accessing the\nfile's metadata.\n\nAlso think of files that have internal structure like tar\nfiles and libraries. With the matching IO plugin one can\naccess these files with the same API that is used for unix\nstyle files/directories. In that sense it is a good idea to\nprovide a fatter interface that has got explicit opendir and\nopenfile methods in addition to plain open that dwims.\n\nRegards, TSa.\n-- \n\n"}
