(I just had to install\ngcc4.1.1) \n\n \n\nNow I'd like to install a packages which requires tcl/tk. So basically I\nneed to reconfigure and re install R right after having installed\ntcl/tk.\n\n \n\nSo I installed tcl/tk I run the process to install R but I receive this\nerror : \n\n \n\nchecking for dummy main to link with Fortran libraries...\n\nnone\n\nchecking for Fortran name-mangling scheme... configure:\n\nerror: cannot compile a simple Fortran program See `config.log' for more\ndetails.\n\n \n\n \n\nI checked in the config.log and the fact is that there's no fortran\ncompiler installed. But don't gcc already have a fortran compiler \"in\"\nit? \n\n \n\n \n\nIf somebody could help I would be thankful and especially if somebody\nhas a clue why it worked without any error before and now yes.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThanks a lot\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJulien Steiner\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
