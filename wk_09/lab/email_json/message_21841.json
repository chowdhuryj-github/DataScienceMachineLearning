(Win2000, R-2.5.0)\n\nWhat I have been doing is using a file compare utility (Beyond \nCompare in my case) to move files in the old \"library\" directory to \nthe new one, if the files are missing in the new one. Then I perform \nan update.packages command.\n\nThis procedure appears to work without problem.\n\nIt would seem much preferable to have all packages saved in an \ninstallation-independent directory, instead of a \"library\" directory \nunder R's installation directory. Then, of course, no update would be \nnecessary.\n\nI can't find how this option is settable in R, other than a direct \nargument to library() or install.package().\n\nHow does one shift the R default libraries location to a particular directory?\n\nThanks.\n\n================================================================\nRobert A.
