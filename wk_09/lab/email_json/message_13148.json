I\nam doing a study on the comparison of severy popular model selection methods\nincluding stepwise using p-value criterian. We know that in SAS the stepwise\nuses p-value criterian, so this method could be a widely-used method.\n\nDoes any one know in R which package has the stepwise using p-value\ncriterian?\n\nThanks,\n\nLi Junjie\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
