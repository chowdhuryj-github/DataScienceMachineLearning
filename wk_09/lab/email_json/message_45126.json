Sorry.\n\nI am learning using R to do survival analysis. As a start I used the\nexample script code provided in the documentation of predict.survreg of\nthe survival package:\n\n# Draw figure 1 from Escobar and Meeker\nfit <- survreg(Surv(time,status) ~ age + age^2, data=stanford2,\ndist='lognormal')\nplot(stanford2$age, stanford2$time, xlab='Age', ylab='Days',\nxlim=c(0,65), ylim=c(.01, 10^6), log='y')\npred <- predict(fit, newdata=list(age=1:65), type='quantile', p=c(.1,\n.5, .9))\nmatlines(1:65, pred, lty=c(2,1,2), col=1)\n\nWhen I compare the graphical output with Fig. 1 of Escobar and Meeker\n(1992), I find that my output produces quantiles that are sloping down\nlinearly with age. The quantiles in Fig. 1 of Escobar and Meeker (1992)\nhowever are obviously non-linear. I compared this with the corresponding\nsection in the S-Plus manual and found that the R and S-Plus are\nvirtually identical (as they should) and that the predicted quantiles in\nS-Plus (Fig. 31.3) are also non-linear.\n\nI checked the obvious help files and R-archive and found nothing on\nthis. I must be making a very basic mistake but can't find it.\n\nYour feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\nBest, Michael\n\n\n\nRef: Escobar and Meeker (1992).
