While Ken is marvelous \nas to keeping us up to date the best way he can, I do have a \nquestion...actually two.\nWe have a spell checker incorporated into our pine setup.  It is apparently \nnot full proof though as I discover missed obvious misspellings later, and \nothers have noted this too.\nI have no idea what we are using, I can find out of course, but does \nanyone know of a great option for pine, perhaps that even has a thesaurus?\nSecond, once in a while others make mention of other browsers aside from \nLynx the cat and the two variations in name of the chain, links and \ne-links.\nfor reasons that I respect even if I do not understand them, e-links cannot \nbe made to work on shellworld just now.  I realize others dislike it, but \nI found it helpful when links itself was not working well with javascript \nlocations.\nAny other browser ideas we might want to refer to Ken for consideration?\nThanks all around,\nKaren\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
