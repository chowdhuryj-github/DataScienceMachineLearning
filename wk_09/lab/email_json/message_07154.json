Our team\n  of correspondents will bring you complete coverage.\n\u00a0\nWe will start by telling you about the incidents\n  that began unfolding at 7:15 this morning in one of the largest residence\n  halls on the Virginia Tech campus and continued two hours later at Norris Hall,\n  an engineering building. By late morning, at least 31 on campus were dead. President\n  Bush said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the news of the shooting, and\n  expressed his sympathy for the victims and their families. Thalia Assuras will\n  talk with some of the students who survived the shooting and have more\n  eyewitness accounts.\n\u00a0\nDaniel Sieberg, our science and technology correspondent,\n  will detail how the university and the students who study there used Internet\n  communications to keep one another informed as the tragedy unfolded.\n\u00a0\nAnd in the wake of such a massacre, it is natural to\n  ask \u201ccould this have been prevented?\u201d Hari Sreenivasan will\n  report on the state of security on campuses around the country.\n\u00a0\nIn the meantime, residents of the Northeast are\n  coping with the remnants of a massive storm that hit over the weekend,\n  bringing record rainfall and strong winds. By Monday afternoon, much of the\n  East Coast was still under water and hundreds of thousands of people were\n  without electricity. Nancy Cordes will have the story.\n\u00a0\nThe National Urban League is releasing a report tomorrow\n  that will show that black men in America don\u2019t have many of\n  the same privileges as other citizens. We\u2019ll have the study\u2019s\n  findings tonight.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us.
