Actually beginning\nwith the 3.0.15/3.0.20 jump.  We event tried 3.1.0 dev release.\nRight now the major advantages of continuing with with the\nupgrade release (nump the revision number) and letter (bug fix)\nreleases is the branch maintenance and vendor pickup.\n\nI think we've found out (as have the kernel devs) that\ncontinuing in the same tree can support both rapid development\nand stable releases.\n\nSo I'm very happy with the current system.  But I'm open to\nother ideas.  We cannot however bump the minor number just due\nto large changes since we would end up changing the minor\nrelease number every time we released. :-)\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGZBU+IR7qMdg1EfYRAuqzAJ9Whxd9PpDeNYFffsh2f29LLZDcyQCfVvC2\nPf6P7eRAsFQaHHgnwdyZfPo=\n=/TKh\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
