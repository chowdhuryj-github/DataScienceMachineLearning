The intention here \nis to have a URL to which to direct new software developers which gives \nthem enough of an overview to start development.\n\nThe current version is here:\n\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/Getting_started_programming\n\nEventually I want it to get close to a \"Developer's Handbook\", but it's \nnowhere near that complete yet.\n\nHave fun,\nMike\n\n-- \n________________________________________________\n  Mike C.
