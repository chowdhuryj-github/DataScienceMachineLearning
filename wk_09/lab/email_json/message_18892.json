However I stuck to calculate each element of that matrix. My question is should I calculate ordinary variance and covariances, taking pairwise variables? or I should take partial covariance between any two variables, keeping other fixed. In my decent opinion is I should go for the second option?\n\nYour help will be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks and regards,\nstat\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
