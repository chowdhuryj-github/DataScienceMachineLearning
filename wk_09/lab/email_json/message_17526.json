To \nconfirm, take a look at the .tex file produced by Sweave.  Find the line \ncorresponding to this figure.  It will be an \\includegraphics call, \nsomething like\n\n\\includegraphics{my.file_Rnw-fig}\n\nYour TeX is probably interpreting this as the file my.file_Rnw-fig \nrather than automatically adding the .pdf file extension, because it \nthinks you've specified the extension to be file_Rnw-fig.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
