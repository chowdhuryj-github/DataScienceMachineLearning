It'd use the com0com\nproject:\nhttp://com0com.sourceforge.net/\n\nto emulate an accent SA or dectalk and pass the input of\nthe serial port to sapi, basically enable softspeech via a\nvirtual serial port.  This could be assigned to vmware and\nSpeakup would be able to use it as a hardware synth. \nBasically I want a self-contained laptop without having to\nhall around the Accent SA.\n\nProblem is, I'm used to programming under Linux where such\nan emulator would be trivial.  Open a /dev/ttySx device,\npoll it, translate the input and call the speech functions. \nI'm just wondering what the simplest api to use under\nWindows would be for a Linux programmer without too much of\na learning curve.  I've looked at mfc and Windows c++ code\nand it looks like nothing I've ever encountered.  I'm\nthinking a system like cygwin or minw32 would work but how\ncomplete is their emulation of serial ports (termios etc.)\nselect/poll and do these unix like systems support the\nSAPI.\n\nShane\n\n-- \nhttp://www.cm.nu/~shane/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
