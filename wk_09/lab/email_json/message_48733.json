This issue, and the larger scale issue of open\nsource in industry\nis being addressed. One has to realize that the behemoth that is the\nclinical aperatus\nof the pharma industry is very conservative and very slow to change. In\nmany cases \nswitching to R would meean changing a great many processes all based on\nlegacy code. One\nof the big issues is that the industry demands consistency not\nnecessarily correctness.\n\nAll that said there are a great many areas where R could be used that\nwould not impact\nregulatory submission, data security etc. Many in pharma are quietly\nworking on this,\nbut steps are small and incremental. Development takes time in industry\nbecause of the amount of\ndocumentation necessary. All this impacts the \"free\" nature of R and\ncost and risk (From the industries\nperspective) need to be justified. \n\nProbably when the statistical community is using Z big pharma will be\nready to use\nR. %P\n\nNicholas\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
