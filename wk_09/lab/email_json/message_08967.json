My x and\ny coordinates are rising numbers. The z coordinate is the measurment. In\nmy matrix if have got ~6000 sorted values for one measurments multiplied \nwith the number of measurments. An example in the end.\n\nMy aim is to get the \"mean values\" and \"standard deviation\" for each value\nbetween the measuements (of the z coordinate). But the problem is. I don't have \nalways the same count of x and y values. See the example (29 4.8 xxx) is \nmissing in measure two.\n\nHas anybody an idea what I can do? I though I could split the measurments\nan copy it horizontal in the matrix. But then I can't work with mean because\nI don't have the same numbers in every measurment (~6000).\n\nThank's a lot.\nYour Felix\n\nPS: Thank you for the help in the past!\n\n\n\n(x&Y polar coordinates) of two measurments\n------------------------------------------\nx\ty\tz\n29\t4.5\t1.505713\n29\t4.6\t1.580402\n29\t4.7\t1.656875\n29\t4.8\t1.735054\n30\t0\t0\n30\t0.1\t0.00096108\n30\t0.2\t0.00323831\n...\n29\t4.5\t1.495148\n29\t4.6\t1.568961\n29\t4.7\t1.644467\n30\t0\t0\n30\t0.1\t0.00093699\n30\t0.2\t0.00319411\n30\t0.3\t0.00676619\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
