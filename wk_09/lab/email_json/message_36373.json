It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.\n\nOf course God will forgive me that's His job.\n\nThe only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.\n\nEven I don't wake up looking like Cindy Crawford.\n\nI skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.\n\nForgiveness is the scent that the rose leaves on the heel that crushes it\n\nYour imagination is your preview of life's coming attractions.\n\nThinking will not overcome fear but action will.\n\nI slept, and dreamed that life was beauty I woke, and found that life was Duty.\n\nTo err is human, but when the eraser wears out ahead of the pencil, you're overdoing it.\n\nA woman one loves rarely suffices for all our needs, so we deceive her with another whom we do not love.\n\n\n"}
