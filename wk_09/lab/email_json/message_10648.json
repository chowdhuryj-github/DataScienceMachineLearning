Add recording and sharing functionality\nto the e-book reader (and to the writing activity, so they can create\nand share their own personal stories); leverage their enthusiasm,\ntheir creativity, their numbers, and their sense of personal ownership.\nWhen parents and older kids take pride in creating content that will\nhelp younger kids learn to read, everybody benefits.\n\nMy parents read to me when I was little; let them read to each other,\nnot only read at by a distant stranger (or a speech synthesis algorithm).\n\n\n-- ?!ng\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
