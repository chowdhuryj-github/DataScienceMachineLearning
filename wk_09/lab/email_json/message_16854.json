NEW JSP DEVELOPMENT COMPETITION:\n\nWe are currently running a competition to develop JSPs for 8 pages in a survey application -- the Morpheus Survey JSP Development project.\n\nIt requires the following deliverables:\n- A JSP for each page in the survey. JSTL should be used to improve JSP readability and functionality.\n- Any JSP templates that the base JSP files reference.\n- A test servlet including mockup entity objects to test and display the submitted JSPs and verify that they function as required. This mockup will be necessary as the Survey Servlet component is not yet developed.\n- Some JavaScript will be required to implement some of the features depicted in the prototype. The details for this are specified below in Section 3.\n\nPrizes:\n- First-place: $3,000\n- Second-place: $1,500\n\nLearn more here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&pj=30001506\n \nGood luck!\n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
