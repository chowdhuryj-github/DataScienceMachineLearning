Three more spacewalks are planned: Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.\n\n\"Hey, thanks for the help on the ground, you guys,\" Reilly radioed from the Quest airlock module.\n\nReilly and Olivas got off to a late start, delayed about an hour when flight controllers had to reset the station's stabilizing gyroscopes. But once outside the Quest airlock, the spacewalkers sailed through a long list of solar array outfitting tasks with no major problems. All their major objectives were met.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
