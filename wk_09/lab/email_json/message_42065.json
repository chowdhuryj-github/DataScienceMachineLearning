Death is dawn, the waking from a weary night of fevers unto truth and light.\n\nCriticism, as it was first instituted by Aristotle, was meant as a standard of judging well.\n\nLogic! Good gracious! What rubbish! How can I tell what I think till I see what I say?\n\nFailure is a detour, not a dead-end street.\n\nProduce great men, the rest follows.\n\nThe lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters.\n\n\nNo one can keep his grieves in their prime they use themselves up.\n\n\n"}
