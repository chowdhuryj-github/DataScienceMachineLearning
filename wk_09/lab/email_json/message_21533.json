I had a lot of fun catching \"The Killers\" in concert \n      Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. They were absolutely fantastic, \n      great rock and roll with really high energy and they did not stop for an \n      hour and a half. We were dancing like crazy. When I told Dave what I did \n      over the weekend he started laughing and didn't think it was a typical \n      concert for a suburban mother of three. But, I\u00a0had to remind Dave \n      that back in the day I was a rock and roll DJ in Texas and I have not lost \n      my cool factor. He got a kick out of it.\n\u00a0\nIt sure was great \n      to see Tony Snow this morning. The White \n      House press\u00a0secretary\u00a0recently took time off to fight \n      a\u00a0recurrence of cancer.\u00a0He \n      still faces chemotherapy but was back at work with a positive message for \n      those who\u00a0also suffer from the \n      disease.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony\u00a0and Harry also \n      chatted about George Tenet's \n      stunning\u00a0\"60 \n      Minutes\" \n      interview with Scott Pelley.\u00a0You can see that \n      interview on\u00a0CBSNews.com. And, \n      Tenet, the\u00a0former director of the CIA, will be on \n      The\u00a0Early \n      Show\u00a0tomorrow to \n      discuss his\u00a0new book, \"At the Center of the Storm.\"\n\u00a0\nAlso today, a couple of \n      pop culture notes, Mark Phillips had \n      the latest from London on the Paul McCartney/Heather Mills split, including the reports that Mills will \n      take another run at reality TV by appearing on the\u00a0British version \n      of\u00a0\"Big Brother.\" Julie joked that maybe she'll appear on \n      the American version! \n\u00a0\nPeople magazine's Jess \n      Cagle gave us the low down on all of the great summer \n      movies coming up. One of the most anticipated \n      is\u00a0\"Spider-Man 3\" which I can tell you is unbelievable. It \n      apparently is the most expensive movie ever\nmade and it has the special effects to prove it.\u00a0I loved \n      it.\u00a0Spider-Man was my favorite super hero growing up, \n      I watched all of the cartoons and boy\u00a0has he come a long way! \n      This week we'll \n      chat with the stars of\u00a0\"Spider-Man 3\" -- Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Bryce Dallas \n      Howard. \n\u00a0\nIt started off cold and \n      rainy in New York but it is now warm and sunny so I am off to exercise and\u00a0enjoy some fresh air. I hope you guys have \n      a fantastic day and I'll see you tomorrow at 7a.m.!\n\u00a0\nTake \n      Care,\n\u00a0\n      \n\n\nHannah \n      Storm\nEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
