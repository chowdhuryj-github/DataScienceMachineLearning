One of the columns is an id variable which is grouped from 1000 through 9000. I need to perform the following operations. \n\n1) Remove all the observations with id's between 6000 and 6999\n\nI tried using this method. \n\nremdat1 <- subset(data, ID<6000)\nremdat2 <- subset(data, ID>=7000)\ndonedat <- rbind(remdat1, remdat2)\n\nI check the last and first entry and found that it did not have ID values 6000. Therefore I think that this might be correct, but is this the most efficient way of doing this?\n\n2) I need to remove observations within columns 3, 4, 6 and 8 when they are negative. For instance if the number in column 3 is -4, then I need to delete the entire observation. Can somebody help me with this too.\n\nThank and Regards\n\nAnup\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
