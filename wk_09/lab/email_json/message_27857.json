The g on the end means it matches (\\d) as\nmany times as it can and applies length(9 x $1) for each one (due to\nthe e).  You can see the behavior by saying\n\necho 500 | perl -ple 's|(\\d)|length(9 x ($1+1))|eg;'\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
