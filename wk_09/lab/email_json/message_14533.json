For example using cor.test(...., method=\"pearson\")\nwith Pearson's corr coeff the output is:\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  a and b\nt = 0.2878, df = 14, p-value = 0.7777\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.4355690  0.5514366\nsample estimates:\n       cor\n0.07669612\n\n\nWhat are all these? Apologies but I am new in R and statistics in\ngeneral.... but a textbook I was looking at, regarding SPSS, explains only\nthe r coeff and the conf interval.... Any help with sources I can refer to?\nParticularly in a broader context as it would not be nice to post all the\ntime such questions...\n\nThanks in advance,\nGM\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
