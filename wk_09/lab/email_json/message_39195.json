This gives you the power of Sweave, but without\nhaving to learn LaTeX.  It works with documents in openoffice (a free\noffice suite similar to and mostly compatible with microsoft office\n(word)).  Using this you can create your template using openoffice\nwriter (or MS word, then convert using openoffice), run it through\nR/odfWeave, and have the result as another openoffice document that can\nthen be converted to MS word or pdf.\n\nPersonally, if I am doing something for myself, or in which the output\nformat does not matter, then I use Sweave with LaTeX (using Emacs and\nESS).  But, often my results need to be sent to a client that will cut\nand past my results into an MS word document or power point\npresentation.  Then I find it easier to use openoffice and odfWeave and\nhave the end result be an MS word document that can be e-mailed to the\nclient for them to mangle in ways they feel the need to.\n\n(there is also an HTML driver for Sweave I nthe the R2HTML package where\nyou can have the template file resemble html and the final output is in\nhtml)\n\nHope this helps, \n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
