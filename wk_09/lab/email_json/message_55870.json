The password is getting set separately\ninside that code, so the password last set time was getting set from the\npassword change logic.\n\nWe also were not parsing a number of fields (like logon hours) from the\nuser_info_25.  That should also be fixed.\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/rpc_samr.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/rpc_parse/parse_samr.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_nt.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_util.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/include/rpc_samr.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/rpc_parse/parse_samr.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_nt.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_util.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/rpc_samr.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/rpc_parse/parse_samr.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_nt.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/rpc_server/srv_samr_util.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (505 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23616\n\n"}
