Following Russia and the\nUS into orbit are the nations of Japan and China, now struggling to\none-up the other in a competition for scientific and national pride. The\npiece covers Japan's new initiative to catch up to the Chinese program,\nas well as some history of the competition \"China launched its first\nmanned space flight in 2003. A second mission in 2005 put two astronauts\ninto orbit for a week, and a third manned launch is planned for next\nyear. This year, China also plans to launch a probe that will orbit the\nmoon. Earlier this month, the country launched a Long March 3-A rocket\nthat sent a navigation satellite into orbit as part of its effort to\nbuild a global positioning system. The satellite is the fourth China has\nlaunched as part of the Compass navigation system, which is expected to\nbe operational in 2008.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/19/1848237\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003672940_webjapanspace19.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| MySpace Takes on Google News and Digg                              |\n|   from the climbing-mount-improbable dept.                         |\n|   posted by Zonk on Thursday April 19, @15:40 (The Internet)       |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/19/1853242              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\ncyberianpan writes \"According to a Times Online article, [0]MySpace is\ngoing into the news business.
