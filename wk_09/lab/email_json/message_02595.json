An exciting conversation can develop with a young person, possibly an Aquarius, who could offer a new viewpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Higher studies such as  philosophy, religion and spirtuality are favorable and active.

It can be stimulating.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friends are an important part of your day and are likely to involve you in physical activities or improvement projects of some sort.

Avoid overwork and physical strain now, yourself, dear one. Instead, put your energies into proven methods and routine duties.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A friendship may be put to the test during this time.

Take your pick.\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is the likelihood that you could dream of a woman you haven't seen in a while.
