My\ndata consists of 50 predictors (22 continuous and 28 categorical) plus a\nbinary response. \n\nUsing glm(), stepAIC() i didn't get satisfactory result as misclassification\nrate is too high. I think categorical variables are responsible for this\ndebacle. Some of them have more than 6 level (one has 10 level).\n\nPlease suggest some better regression model for this situation. If possible\nyou can suggest some article.\n\nthanking you.\n\nTirtha\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Appropriate-regression-model-for-categorical-variables-tf3908982.html#a11083540\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
