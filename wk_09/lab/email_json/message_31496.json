That seems to have done the trick. But I'm not surewhether I have copied the right jvm.dll file into the path.\nI have 3 places where a jvm.dll file can be found: \n~\\Java\\jre1.6.0_01\\bin\\client   -    this is the one i copied~\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_01\\jre\\bin\\client~\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_01\\jre\\bin\\server\nDid I copy the right one? or do the all have exactly the same file but justplaced in different directories?\nMany thanks\n\n\nmister_bluesman wrote:> > Basically, I\\u2019m trying to install rJava on my windows XP machine.
