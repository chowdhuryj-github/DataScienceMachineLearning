Nancy Cordes will have the full story, and we\u2019ll \n      also take a look at whether the FDA has the financial ability to fix the \n      problem. Classes resumed today at Virginia Tech one week after the \n      shooting rampage that left 32 students dead. Sharyn Alfonsi has our \n      report from Blacksburg, Virginia. Jim Axelrod will bring \n      you the latest on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who has just received \n      another vote of confidence from President Bush. Gonzales has promised to \n      stay in his post as long as he can \u201ccontinue to serve \n      effectively.\u201dPolitics has become a popular pastime in France. At \n      least 84 percent of the country\u2019s voters cast ballots in the first round \n      of presidential elections. Now, it is down to two candidates with very \n      different visions for the country\u2019s future. Sheila MacVicar will \n      report. Boris Yeltsin, the man who engineered the final collapse \n      of the Soviet Union and brought a market economy to Russia, died this \n      morning.

She\u2019ll also give you a peek into some of the \n      lesser-known events of the former president\u2019s life. Back in the \n      United States, a judge exonerated a man \u2013 after he had served 25 years in \n      prison. Jerry Miller had been found guilty of rape, robbery, aggravated \n      kidnapping and battery in 1981. Today he became the 200th prisoner \n      exonerated due to DNA evidence, according to a group that works to free \n      wrongly-convicted inmates. Byron Pitts will have the story. \n      The soundtrack of the young generation is hip-hop music \u2013 and its \n      biggest consumers are young white males. It is an industry where sex and \n      violence sell \u2013 but not everyone\u2019s happy about that. Bill Whitaker \n      will examine the debate over vulgar, violent lyrics. Remember \n      those funky, flimsy 3D glasses from decades ago? NASA is bringing them \n      back. It has compiled images of the sun from two orbiters and laid them on \n      top of each other for a three-dimensional effect. Jerry Bowen will \n      give you a look.
