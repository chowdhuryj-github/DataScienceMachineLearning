This package would set default configurations on debian desktop (mount scripts, gnome or kde configurations, etc.). Like:\ndesktop-base content: none.debian-desktop-art: desktop-base as we've in Etch.debian-desktop-settings: set default configurations of debian-desktop\u00a0\nThoughts?regards,-- stratushttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com--To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to \ndebian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.orgwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
