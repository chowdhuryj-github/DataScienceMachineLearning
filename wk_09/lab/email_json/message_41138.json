So I used the command \"StructTS\" but I failed to obtain a desirable output, in fact when I write in R Console the following lines:\n> > x=(1,2,3,4,5,2,25,14,12,13,11,6,9,24,12,13,14,12,12,14,11,12,14,15,20,21,22,23,21,25,28)\n> >(fit <- StructTS(x,type = \"BSM\"))\n> I obtained the following message:\"error in makeBSM(x, nf): the frequency has to be  positif  entire for BSM\"\n> I would like via this command(StrucTS) obtain estimation of seasonality and local level trend components of the time series \"x\".\n> Can you help me please .
