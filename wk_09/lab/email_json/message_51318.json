Iknow that this could be a stupid question to ask, but I'm not able to solve\nit by myself... One example: if my model is\nresponse = operator + block + daywith operator and block as fixed effects and day as random effect, I use\nres.lme <- lme(resp ~ oper + block , random=~1|day)\nIf I want to include also another random effect, as \"experiment\", what Ishould do ?This effect doesn't have to be nested, at the and I would like to have theCOV matrix using (if I'm not wrong) getVarCov function.\nThanks in advance for any help or suggestions, I'm a beginner on thisfield...\nDavide\n_________________________________________________________________Cinema, Tv, Gossip e Orsoscopo\\u2026Tutto su MSN intrattenimento!\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guidehttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
