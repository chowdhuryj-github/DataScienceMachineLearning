Secondly portaudio v18 didn't support alsa, and\nwhile portaudio v19 can use alsa, at the time not all distros, and see\nfirst comment as portaudio v19 seemed just as bad or possibly worse when\nusing the alsa driver, so as other speech-dispatcher generic modules use\ncreating a temp wave file I decided to go with that (for me the results\nweren't bad, still much better than flite or festival for\nresponsiveness).\n\nFurther to the above, some users of orca have found stuttering with the\ngnome-speech espeak driver (which produces audio through portaudio), but\nfound by using the speech-dispatcher module (when creating a wave file)\nthe stuttering went away.\n\nAdmittedly it probably isn't the most efficient way to create speech,\nbut it seems the most reliable to me, but if you find you don't need\nthis then why not customise it for yourself. \n\nFrom\nMichael Whapples\nOn Tue, 2007-06-19 at 11:16 -0400, ace wrote:\n> Greg,\n> \n> That was indeed the problem.
