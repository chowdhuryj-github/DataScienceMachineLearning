It is the deepest part of autobiography.\n\nBe content to be what you are, and prefer nothing to it, and do not fear or wish for your last day.\n\nOne had better die fighting against injustice than die like a dog or a rat in a trap.\n\nSkillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness, loquaciousness, and laryngitis.\n\n\n"}
