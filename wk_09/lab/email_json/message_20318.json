How do I alter this behaviour?\n\nAll the software is from the ubuntu repositories, so it's nothing I'm\nbroken as far as I'm aware. The genericexecutestring variable (may have\ngot the name wront), is commented out, and I can't find any other\noptions.\n\nCheers in advance for any help.\n\nChris Norman.\n\n\nEmail has been scanned for viruses by Altman Technologies' email management service - www.altman.co.uk/emailsystems\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
