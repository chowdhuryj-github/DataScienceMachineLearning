That is totally not the point of this post or problem, please.) I won't do it anywyas eaven if you suggest that. Doing nice-levels will never get rid of the threading issues.\nRegards, --Keith.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
