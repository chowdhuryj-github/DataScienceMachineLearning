The box I posted uses Freevo rather than MythTV\nbut afaik, the functionality of the two apps is similar. \nFreevo is more of a set-top frontend though which supports\nextensive media playback options through mplayer.  The\nspeech interface to that is custom built.  A trivial patch\nmind you but custom.  I've never played with MythTV but if\nit doesn't use gtk, qt or whatever the X-windows based\nscreenreaders use, I'm sure you could modify Myth to simply\ncall an external program for speech output.  That's all my\nfreevo patch does, runs a script with the text on\ncommandline.  The script then takes care of the rest,\nkilling any other speak scripts which happen to be running\nso you can interrupt it by pressing buttons quickly and\nthen calling a speech synthesizer, Festival, Dectalk or the\nlike.\n\nS\n\n-- \nhttp://www.cm.nu/~shane/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
