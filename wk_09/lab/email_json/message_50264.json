I recently sent you a letter in which I explained, with proof, the special place Friday the 13th holds in world history and what you, Memo, could hope for on this date of extraordinary luck!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, I haven't heard back from you.\u00a0 Even more seriously, I'm worried that you might miss this chance to gain the immense benefits that could be yours, starting on Friday, July 13th, 2007, and which promises to launch you on an unbelievable lucky streak that will last for 365 days after this powerful event!\nBELIEVE ME, GREAT LUCK CAN COME IN SWIFT AND DRAMATIC FASHION DURING THIS MAGICAL TIME.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why? Because, contrary to popular superstition, Friday the 13th can (especially for certain individuals) actually be a day of significant good fortune and opportunity.\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I will show you exactly how you can beone of those certain very lucky individuals,starting on Friday, July 13th! \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have here in front of my eyes letters from friends who got my help in discovering the secrets of how to turn bad luck into powerful good luck and positive breakthroughs. Here is an example: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I just have to share with you my piece of good luck.\u00a0 A few days ago, after I received your predictions...I won $1000!\u00a0 I had never won $1000 before.\u00a0 It was such a blessing and an answer to my prayers.\u00a0 Thanks again and God bless you for using your gift to help others...\" \n-\u00a0A.M.A., VA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the huge number of people who have written about how they have profited from this day, I could go on forever.\u00a0 But the purpose of this letter is not to make you regret what you might've missed in the past, but to offer you YOUR VERY OWN CHANCE to benefit from this \"day unlike any other day.\"\nTHIS IS NOT MERELY IDLE SUPERSTITION!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power of Friday the 13th is serious business!\u00a0 Whether you believe in superstitions or not, their power to affect innumerable aspects of every day life is undeniable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, baseball, \"America's game,\" is famous for its superstitions.\u00a0 In 1996 John Wetteland, closing pitcher for the New York Yankees, refused to change his cap for the entire regular and post baseball season. He ended up leading the Yankees to their first World Series win since 1978, broke an eighteen-year streak of bad luck, and was ultimately voted Most Valuable Player of the championship series.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Streets named by numbers often skip the number 13, and in high rise buildings, the twelfth floor is almost always followed immediately by the 14th floor.\u00a0 The 13th floor is simply \"skipped\" over or given a \"safer\" label.\nScience itself has proven the power of superstitions ingeneral and of Friday the 13th in particular...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every Friday the 13th coincides with a measurable economic downturn.\u00a0 On that day people tend to avoid travel, business transactions, and contact with the outside world.\u00a0 As a result the restaurant, vacation, and entertainment industries lose billions of dollars.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there's more to it than just people's fears. Scientific studies performed in Britain proved that although fewer people drive on Friday the 13th, the number of collision-related hospital admissions is significantly greater than on normal Fridays.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are people just driving \"spooked\" on Friday the 13th...so that they're jittery and more prone to foolish mistakes?\u00a0 Does the economy take a dip because nervous people simply stay home?\u00a0 Do superstitious practices just enhance a baseball player's sense of security and confidence and help him succeed?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly, but I think it's something more than that, don't you?\nI want to tell you a secret: Friday the 13this actually an incredible force for good luck and prosperity\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The legend of the number 13 itself goes back to 600 B.C. and the philosophy of Pythagoras, who believed that 13 did not mean a cutoff, but rather a chance for evolution and change.\u00a0 It did not point to warnings of endings but rather to new beginnings.\u00a0 Thus, it was a number to be favored and a favorable date on which to enter this world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friday the 13th was also a holy day in the Church. A true miracle occurred at St. Paul's Cathedral, in London, on Friday the 13th in December, 1940.\u00a0 The lives of hundreds of people were saved when the famous church remained untouched during one of the worst air raids in the history of World War II.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This magical day has even made baseball history! On Friday, April 13, 1984, Pete Rose hit a double off Jerry Koosman in Olympic Stadium to become only the second player to reach the 4,000-hit level, after Ty Cobb.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of Friday the 13th's history, there is an inexplicable sense that luck can be dramatically altered on this date -- a feeling so strong that, as studies have shown, it affects the fortunes of millions of people throughout the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, unlike you, Memo, these people do not know how to take the power of Friday the 13th and turn it into a force for incredible good luck and prosperity!\u00a0 That is why I don't want you to miss...\nYOUR CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS!ON FRIDAY, JULY 13TH, 2007 TO BE EXACT...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And believe me, because it's the last Friday the 13th of this year, you must not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES miss this tremendously lucky date!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A SECRET, MEMO...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you know that most people wait for beneficial events to come to them?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a mistake!\u00a0 Not only will they have to wait a very long time before any beneficial event occurs, but on top of that, there is no evidence to show that, if a person is not ready to receive them, these happy events will ever come to pass!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only truly successful method I know of for taking advantage of beneficial events is to be one step ahead of them...to actually encourage wonderful things to happen to you.\u00a0 This is the way\u00a0- the only way\u00a0- you stand any chance of winning something.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the other hand, you choose (as I would) to be one step ahead of these beneficial events, I can help you.\u00a0 I can reveal to you, among other things, how to obtain from this day of blessings, and the other 365 days following it, benefits you will treasure for the rest of your life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can be one of the few, lucky individuals who\u00a0gains from this day.\u00a0 You'll be free and empowered to buy lottery tickets, change jobs, purchase homes, travel to gambling casinos and engage in any and every other conceivable activity where fate might have an opportunity to give you a happy pat on the shoulder.\nNO ONE WILL BE AS PREPARED FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS YOU.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why?\u00a0 Because unlike most people who only hope for good luck, your luck is already waiting for you to draw it in. Fortunately too, I stand ready to assist you in ATTRACTING as much luck and good fortune as possible, helping you to capitalize on Friday, July 13th's own POSITIVE energy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How?\u00a0 By providing you with a very special Talisman that will help you to function as a virtual \"psychic magnet\" so that you can pull in all the money, romance, power and good fortune that my senses tell me will soon be within your reach.\nHERE IS WHAT YOU MUST DO TO DRAW MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROMTHIS DAY BLESSED BY THE GODS!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it is absolutely vital that you wear, on Friday, July 13th, 2007 and for the 365 days following it, a very specially magnetized talisman...\nTHE \"MEDALLION OF HOPE\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crafted in genuine 24K gold vermeil, for purity and protection, I had the \"Medallion of Hope\" made to reflect the design of an ancient talisman that has brought me incalculable success and happiness over the years.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I want you to have this medallion, so you too can uncover its secrets and invaluable benefits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prominently featuring three mystical symbols, the \"Medallion of Hope\" has the power to attract and magnify your good luck on this unique Friday the 13th (the last of two such occurrences this year).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dragon:Energetic, strong-willed and tough...and celebrated as a symbol of prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture...the Dragon represents success in business and financial matters.\n\n\n\nThe Ankh:The ancient symbol of both physical love, the union of male and female, and spiritual love, the Ankh represents harmony and oneness between heaven and earth.\n\n\n\nThe Eagle:The soaring symbol of rebirth represents the triumph of spiritual power over sickness and the ability to see the world around you, zero in on an opportunity, swoop in and seize it.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your 24K Gold Vermeil \"Medallion of Hope\" has been designed around one of the most powerful metaphysical symbols known, The Mandala.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This symbol represents the intersection of cosmic events and earthly experiences. The circle enclosing the square represents the heavens surrounding the earth. The cardinal points, representing entrances, one on each side of the square, represent transitional axes where the transfer of energy between heaven and earth takes place.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Mandala is believed to concentrate the positive energy of the universe within its form.\u00a0 You might even feel a mild tingling when you wear your Medallion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you can see, the symbols I've already told you about, by themselves, make this an incredibly powerful piece.\u00a0 However, I have incorporated additional symbols in your \"Medallion of Hope\" to enhance and extend its considerable power.\nThe Torch:The emblem of Eros and Aphrodite, it symbolizes the flame of love.\u00a0 \nThe Compass:Contained in a circle of perfection and quartered by the four points, it is a symbol of reason and knowledge.\u00a0\nThe Key:A symbol of both opening and closing, it represents the ability to unlock hidden secrets.\nThe Laurel Garland:This symbol of purity represents victory and success.\u00a0\nPlus, you'll get the purity and protection of gold andthe calming, healing power of silver\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your precious vermeil \"Medallion of Hope\" is forged from two of the most powerful precious metals on earth --Sterling Silver and a genuine 24K Gold. For millennia, Gold has been prized for its purity and wealth-attracting energies.\u00a0 And lustrous Sterling Silver, with its superlative reflective properties, radiates with energy of healing, calm, and protection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With your \"Medallion of Hope\" you can immediately prepare yourself for an incredible year of change that starts Friday the 13th, July 2007!\nIf you prepare yourself for good fortune, Memo, positive vibrations of destiny will shower you with good luck and prosperity!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way, Friday the 13th will bring new beginnings and change to your life\u00a0- but not just any beginnings or change.\u00a0 It will help draw dynamic opportunities of the kind you have long dreamed of!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you wear your medallion on Friday, July 13th, don't just sit back and let things happen to you.\u00a0 This is a time to take action!\u00a0 Serious action!\u00a0 For efforts made on Friday the 13th have been known to be as much as four times as powerful as they would be on any ordinary day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remember, extraordinary things happen when the number 13 combines with Friday to create a magical vibration.\u00a0 That's because this is when the auspicious number 13 is combined with the powers of Venus, the planet of love and good fortune that rules Fridays.\nAn incredible value, exclusively for you\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the tremendous power of its unique, ancient symbolism -- forged in genuine 24K gold vermeil -- the \"Medallion of Hope\" is a truly rare and incredible value, unavailable in stores or on the web.
