Next, go down once and change \"user mode\" \nto advanced.  Next, go to \"keypad mode\" and set it to \"links are \nnumbered.\"  Then, work your way down to \"show cursor\" and turn that on as \nwell.  Lastly, go all the way to the top and hit enter on \"accept \nchanges.\"  This will make life a lot easier.  I can't recall if you have \nto exit lynx or not to have the changes take effect.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
