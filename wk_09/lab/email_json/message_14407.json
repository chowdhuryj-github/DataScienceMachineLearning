As of this second, quit doing less-than-excellent work.\n\nHome is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.\n\nHe that lives to forever, never fears dying.\n\nEven when the experts all agree, they may well be mistaken.\n\nFlattery is like cologne water, to be smelt, not swallowed.\n\nOne of the darkest evils of our world is surely the unteachable wildness of the Good.\n\nHappiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly.\n\nOne who imitates what is bad always goes beyond his model while one who imitates what is good always comes up short of it.\n\nChoosing goals that are important to you is one of the most essential things you can do in order to live your dreams.\n\nFood is an important part of a balanced diet.\n\nNone of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
