Matlab definitely has the edge when it comes to the interactivity of its graphs.\nIn addition I find the little operator end extremely useful in indexing arrays. (as in x(1:end,) )\nThe notation is MUCH more cumbersome in R using nrow() and ncol() recursively (as in x[1:nrow(x), ] ).\nIs there a package that might contain an implementation of the end operator ?\n\nThanks !\n\nMarkus\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
