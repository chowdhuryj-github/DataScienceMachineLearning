Iwould of course prefer using apt-get. \n(2)should I also install the r-commended bundle? I did not do this lasttime and as Peter has pointed out, this might have caused the problem.\nDeepankar\n\nOn Thu, 2007-04-19 at 21:53 +0100, Prof Brian Ripley wrote:> 'grid' is an integral part of R, so this suggests your R installation is > broken.
