This is not done by jostling in the street.\nWe grow neither better or worse as we get old, but more like ourselves.\nIt's easy to work for somebody else all you have to do is show up.\nThe wise man does at once what the fool does finally.\nLet us not be too particular it is better to have old secondhand diamonds than none at all.''\nThere is only one way left to escape the alienation of present day society: to retreat ahead of it.\nTo refuse graciously is to confer a favor.\nSometimes I have a terrible feeling that I am dying not from the virus, but from being untouchable.\nBelieving: it means believing in our own lies. And I can say that I am grateful that I got this lesson very early.\nThe sharp thorn often produces delicate roses.\nIf I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior.\nNo man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.\nAlways borrow from a pessimist, he never expects anything back.\nThe few who do are the envy of the many who only watch.\nEnthusiasm is the mother of effort, and without it nothing great was ever achieved.\nEvery man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.\nThe only practice that's now constant is the practice of constantly accommodating to change.\nEvery action of our lives touches on some chord that will vibrate in eternity.\n\u00a0"}
