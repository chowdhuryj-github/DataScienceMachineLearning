Festival wants the Festival server, that's \ninstalled on my Ubuntu machine. But when I start SD, I get the message \nthat a file named speech-dispatcher.scm was not found. Which file? Where \nto get or how to create?\nFlite runs over OSS, but for better results it was recommended to \ninstall NAS. Since I don't know the program I didn't install. Is it \nuseful, and is it easy to handle? I could use Flite with OSS, but that \ndevice blocks other sound applications, such as music and video players, \nso I don't like it.\nAny tips and hints?\nHermann\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
