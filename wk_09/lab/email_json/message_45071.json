And we all know the strong relationship between Duck Tape and\ngaffa tape.  With this information in mind, what light can we add to the\nGaffa debate?  Is Kate saying that she's suspended in duck poop?  Or\nmaybe it was a foreshadowing of The Ninth Wave?  Perhaps her boat sinks\ndue to an unintentional Duck Tape malfunction?\n\n|>oug\n\nP.S. And to those who still claim that \"gaffa tape\" is not synonymous\nwith \"gaffer's tape\", please Google \"gaffa tape\" to have your profound\nmisconception corrected.\n\n"}
