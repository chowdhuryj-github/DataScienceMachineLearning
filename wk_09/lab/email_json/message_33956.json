An ambition man, has as many as there are people who helped him get his fortune.\nAlthough it is generally known, I think it's about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.\nAmbition is not what man does... but what man would do.\nIt is a toss up whether it is worse to be old and bent or young and broke.\nIt takes a great man to give sound advice tactfully, but a greater to accept it graciously.\nAnyone can tell the truth, but only very few of us can make epigrams.\nThose who have free seats at a play hiss first.\nMiddle age is when you've met so many people that every new person you meet reminds you of someone else.\nDust is a protective coating for fine furniture.\nHe that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.\nThe authority of any governing institution must stop at its citizen's skin.\nThe broad general rule is that a man is about as big as the things that make him angry.\n\u00a0"}
