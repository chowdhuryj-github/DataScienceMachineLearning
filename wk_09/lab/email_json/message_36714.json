Your \nmachine is an Apple so things may be different, but with PCs, you \nneed to extract the firmware from the Windows drivers of the wireless \ncard (or download extracted firmware from the web).  See \nhttp://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop/2007/05/msg00055.html\n\nAlso, sending the same message to several mailing lists at the same \ntime is usually not considered good practice.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
