Windows clients\nfrequently require a reboot in order to clear any cached\ninformation about MS-DFS root shares on a server and you may\nexperience failures accessing file services on Samba 3.0.25\nservers until the client reboot is performed.  Alternately,\nyou may explicitly re-enable the parameter in smb.conf.   Please\nrefer to the smb.conf(5) man page for more details.\n\n\n\n================\nDownload Details\n================\n\nThe uncompressed tarballs and patch files have been signed\nusing GnuPG (ID 6568B7EA).
