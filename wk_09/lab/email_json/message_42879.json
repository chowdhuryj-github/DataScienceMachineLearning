After all, that\ncompiler would be materials that cannot be released in source format under\nconditions of this licence.\n\nIf so, how does that not break DFSG 9 by contaminating other software?\n\nIn practical terms, we are compiling lft with gcc\nhttp://buildd.debian.org/fetch.cgi?&pkg=lft&ver=2.0-1&arch=ia64&stamp=1045692069&file=log\nand gcc is under the GPL\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nwhich cannot be released in source format under MainNerve Public License.\nWhy are the lft binary packages distributable?\n\nThere is a slightly different licence at http://pwhois.org/license.who\nbut this part has not changed.\n\nHope that helps,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
