Each of these 79 variables have values that range\nbetween -4 to +4, and I want to subset this data frame so that in the\nresulting new dataframe, values of _all_ of these variables should\nrange between -3 and +3.\n\nLet's say I have the following dataframe (it's a toy example with 4\nindividuals and 5 variables):\n\nsubj1 <- cbind(-4, -3, -1, -5, -7)\nsubj2 <- cbind(-2, -1, -1, -2, +2)\nsubj3 <- cbind(+2, +1, +2, +1, +2)\nsubj4 <- cbind(-4, -1, -2, +2, +1, +1)\n\nmydf <- as.data.frame(rbind(subj1, subj2, subj3, subj4))\n\n>From mydf, I want to generate a new dataframe (let's call it mydf1)\nwhich will have records of only subj2 and subj3 in it since only these\ntwo individuals had all values for variables V1 through V5 in mydf to\nrange between -3 and +3.\n\nDocumentation on subsetting and indexing data frames did not help to\nsolve this specific problem. There may be an obvious solution to it\nbut I just cannot seem to get it.\n\nWould greatly appreciate your inputs.\n\n[relevant information: R-version: 2.4.1, running on Windows XP]\n\n/Arin Basu\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
