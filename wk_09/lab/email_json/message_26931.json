I don't see a checkWarning\ntest, but imagine it could be added.  Another feature that I imagine\ncould be added is to actually compare the error/warning message.  I'm\nnot sure how much benefit there is to that since it basically means\nputting the error message in two places, but I suppose it can be\nuseful to make sure that any formatting of inputs is being done\nproperly.\n\n+ seth\n\n-- \nSeth Falcon | Computational Biology | Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nhttp://bioconductor.org\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
