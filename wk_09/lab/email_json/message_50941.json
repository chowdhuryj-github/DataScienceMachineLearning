If a concern is\nincreasing RAM (which is important in R since objects are stored in\nRAM), then you will want to get 64 bit if you plan on getting a\ncomputer with over 4GB RAM. I'm not sure about this (someone correct\nme if I'm wrong), but I think that windows has problems addressing\nthat much RAM (surely the 64bit Vista is OK with it though... surely).\nLinux or Apple (the powermac) might be better bets if you're wanting\nto work with programs that use a lot of RAM. BTW, Intel does make 64\nbit chips now. They use them in macs.\n\nAs for speed, go with multicore processors with as much GHz as possible.\n\nOn 6/19/07, Robert McFadden  wrote:\n> Dear R Users,\n> I hope that there is someone who has an experience with a problem that I\n> describe below and will help me.\n> I must buy new desktop computer and I'm wondering which processor to choose\n> if my only aim is to speed up R.
