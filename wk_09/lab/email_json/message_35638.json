I see (from wikipedia:  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ \nRatio_distribution#Gaussian_ratio_distribution) that this calculation  \nis quite involved, so I'm hoping that someone has already coded a  \nfunction to achieve this.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Lawrence\nGraduate Student, Department of Psychology, Dalhousie University\n\nWebsite: http://myweb.dal.ca/mc973993\nPublic calendar: http://icalx.com/public/informavore/Public\n\n\"The road to wisdom?
