You have to locate the xml file throught the content table.\n\nI suggest you get the (huge) spec:\n http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm\n(it has both .docx and PDF files)\n\nRelevent parts of the spec are:\n\nPart 2, Annex F list the content type.\nPart 2, 10. \"Core Properties\" List the core properties from a package\npoint of view.\nPart 3, 7.2 \"Metadata\" Explain these properties\nPart 4, 7.2 \"Extended Properties\"\nPart 4, 7.3 \"Custom Properties\" These last two describe the schema and\nhow to use it.\n\nAs for opening these files, libgsf in SVN now support these OpenPackage\nfiles that the Microsoft Office OpenXML supports. This is what Gnumeric\nand the AbiWord SoC use to open the new Microsoft files.\n\n\nHave fun,\n\nHub\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
