The event was organised by Andrew Garton\nof the Open Channel Screen Resource Centre (http://www.openchannel.org.au) a\ngovernment funded film production and training centre, and was hosted by Horse\nBazaar (http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/)\na great digital-arts bar in the heart of Melbourne\nthat hosts the Digital Fringe Festival each year. Elliott Bledsoe and I from\nCCau were both there to help with training and addressing tricky issues (eg licence\ncompatibility, searching etc). \n\u00a0\nWhat we ended up with was a 10 minute film that incorporates\n110 CC-licensed works \u2013 photos, video, sound, music. This final product\nwas screened in Horse Bazaar and on the big screen in Melbourne\u2019s cultural hub, Federation Square,\nat 7pm Monday 14 May. It\u2019s also available for download under a BY-NC-SA\nlicence at http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/.\n\n\u00a0\nIt was a truly amazing experience, and a great learning\ncurve for both us and the participants. Elliott and Andrew both documented the\nexperience on their blogs (http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/\nand http://elliottsawitfirst.blogspot.com/).\n\u00a0We\u2019re also hoping to write up some of the lessons learned in an\narticle, and maybe even an academic paper.\n\u00a0\nJessica Coates\nCCau\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n"}
