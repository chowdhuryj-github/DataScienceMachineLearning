I have both a doubletalk and a tripletalk.\n\n     Okay.  Thanks.  I think the DoubleTalk will do, as long as SpeakUp\nsupports it.  I don't really have any other need but to get Linux up and\nrunning.  Most of the people I know use Windows XP now, and I can't\nreally help them with it.  Hell, I can't even find the link to change my\nlogin passwords in the thing.   \tIf I can use SpeakUp with bash,\nvi, lynx, tin, and bitchx, I'll be rolling in clover.  Give me a good\ndraft mule to do the job.  They can keep the pretty Clydesdales.\nUsed to run a Playstation for games, because I was tired of\nupgrading the computer every couple months.  I think the only reason\nthey have faster internet connections now, is so they can deluge you\nwith better looking spam.   Jeez, I'm getting old fashioned. \n     I don't plan on taking the synth anywhere at the moment.  I think\nI'd rather do synthesis in software for the laptop.  Less stuff to tote\naround, but I'm just getting into all this and don't really know what my\nneeds are going to be.  If I can get away with a pin drive for Win-Eyes,\nmaybe that'll be all I need to get someone else's system functional...if\nthat ever happens.  I don't know anyone else with a computer that lives\nclose-by.  You should see my system.  I still have one of those \"under \nthe monitor\" power panels with a strip of toggle switches across the \nfront.  Behind the monitor there three different extension cords that \nall the AC adapters are plugged into.  I like being able to switch off \nsound during a phone call, or the modem when Win-Eyes starts saying \"App \nStarting\" too many times to count.  I tried loc.gov the other day and \nWin-eyes must have said that 20 different apps had started.  Weird.  Got \nspooked and hit the master switch...shut it all down.  I don't care for \nJava and having my system running someone else's code.  I plan on \npreventing all that $#|+ with Linux.  They shouldn't be able to control \nanything but the currently active window.  Anything more is an invasion \nin my opinion.  It's also illegal here in California, by law...accessing \nor causing the access of data without permission.  Off topic.  I'll shut \nup...\n\n         Michael\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
