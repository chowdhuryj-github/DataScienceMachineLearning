Check svn or svk status.  \nRun these time-consuming analysis tests on only the modified files.\n\nMy theories are:\n\n\t* it sucks a lot less to run the full test suite if it doesn't spend a third \nof its time verifying that, yes, files that haven't actually changed are \nstill valid\n\t* people don't run the full test suite before they commit changes, in part, \nbecause it sucks to run the full test suite\n\t* if no one touches a valid file, it won't get updated in a new checkout and \nthere's no way previously-valid POD will suddenly become invalid POD\n\nThere's a reason we don't run a lot of these tests in release tarballs.  That \nreason is that it's exceedingly silly to run those tests in release tarballs.\n\n-- c\n\n"}
