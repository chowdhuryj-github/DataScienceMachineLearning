If Sun turned nasty and decided to sue me, I should not have \nto hire a *California* lawyer or fly there simply in order to defend \nmyself.  This is the problematic part.  Without choice-of-jurisdiction, \nI could simply have my lawyer file a reply saying \"No alleged \ninfrigement took place in California, throw this out, you have to file \nsuit in my home state.\"\n\nThis clause could be used in an acceptable manner, of course: if the \n\"notice contained within the Original Software\" stated that it was in \nfact subject to the jurisdiction and venue of whatever court would \nnormally have jurisdiction, then this clause would really be moot.  :-)\n\n> with\n>   the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n>   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n>   expenses.\nHaven't heard much if any comment on this.\n\n>   [...]\n>   You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n>   United States export administration regulations (and the export\n>   control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n>   distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\nProbably OK.
