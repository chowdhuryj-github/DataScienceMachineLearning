Actually, to be honest I'm not\nreally having trouble calling the commands such as La_dgesv from\nwithin my C code, but I do get warning when compiling the package\nsaying:\n\nGAUSSlkhd.c: In function 'GAUSSlkhd':\nGAUSSlkhd.c:37: warning: implicit declaration of function 'La_dgesv'\nGAUSSlkhd.c:37: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without\na cast\n\nI tried using:\n\n#include \n\nbut it won't compile the package at all with that included,\ncomplaining that\n\nbjl.h:5:30: error: Rmodules/Rlapack.h: No such file or directory\n\nCan someone explain to me how I should include the AWESOME wrapper\ncode to the Lapack libraries?  Am I not following the proper protocol\nby using these La_* commands in my package source code?\n\nTIA,\nBrian\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
