Have tried Venables and Ripley and other guides but can't find a\nsolution.\n\nI have an experiment with 12 tanks.  Each tank holds 10 fish.  The 12 tanks\nhave randomly assigned one of 4 food treatments - S(tarve), L(ow), M(edium)\nand H(igh).  There are 3 reps of each treatment.  I collect data on size of\neach fish at the end of the experiment.  So my data looks like\n\nTank  Trt   Fish   Size\n1      S     1      3.4\n1      S     2      3.6\n....\n1      S    10      3.5\n2      L     1      3.4\n....\n12    M     10      2.1\n\nTo do the correct test of hypothesis using anova, I need to calculate the\ntank means and use those in the anova.  I have tried using tapply() and by()\nfunctions, but when I do so I \"loose\" the treatment level because it is\ncategorical.  I have used \nMeandat<tapply(Size,list(Tank, Trt), mean)\n\nBut that doesn't give me a dataframe that I can then use to do the actual\naov analysis.  So what is the most efficient way to accomplish the analysis\n\nThanks\n\nTom Miller\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
