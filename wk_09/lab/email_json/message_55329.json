It is not advised for most newbies to\nuse git as is. Instead advisable to try cogito which is \"version\ncontrol system layered on top of the git tree history\nstorage system\"\n\nNow comparing different dvcs -\n\nHere's a (and partly uninformed) comparison  of different dvcs on\ntheir various flaws and features -\nhttp://changelog.complete.org/posts/528-Whose-Distributed-VCS-Is-The-Most-Distributed.html\n\nAnd all that you needed to know about scm ( discussion to death ) -\nhttp://versioncontrolblog.com/category/scm-tools-comparison/\n\nIts interesting to note the comments from the Mozilla project on their\nchoice of version control.\n\nBut common to all of them - bzr is featureful but slow currently.\n\nComing to my personal tastes -\n1. git really shines in cherry picking and multiway merge.\n2. More importantly it supports both push and pull.\n3. Personally I like git because of of its speed and size and the huge\npush it receives because of its use by the kernel guys.\n\nregards,\nChetan S\n\n"}
