Therefore\nit assumed that the user would want the write potential of the\nolder program to take precedence over the read-only potential of\nthe newer program.  It looks to me like there are some inconsistencies\nin how it made those arrangements.\n\nRich\n\n\n---- Original message ----\n>Date: Fri, 11 May 2007 21:14:31 -0400\n>From: Duncan Murdoch   \n>\n>shell.exec(\"foo.pdf\") does the same thing that \"start foo.pdf\" would do \n>from a Windows command line.
