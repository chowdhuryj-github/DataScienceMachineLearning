We know that the chances of the US winning a WTO dispute with\nThailand over Thailand's implementation of the TRIPS compulsory\nlicensing standard lie between zero and zero.\n\nDispute resolution chapters of FTAs may well set up a different\npolitical dynamic.  The degree of transparency of the dispute\nresolution process depends on what the parties have agreed to on\ntransparency.  Clearly, third parties cannot participate in the way\nthey can in the WTO.  By targeting the threat of cross-retaliation on\nthose domestic groups (usually infuential) with the most to gain from\nthe FTA, the US might get a settlement that it would never have got\nin the WTO.  A state might decide to pay some of the monetary\nassessment (a remedy available under FTAs) that US could demand if it\nwon in order to make the problem go away.  (The US would calculate\nthe monetary assessment with the help of the US pharmaceutical\nindustry.) The legal arguments available to both parties would depend\non the terms of the FTA and its negotiating history.\n\nFTAs are, in effect, setting up a system of many trade courts and\nthis will have long-term ramifications both for the WTO's dispute\nresolution mechanism and for weaker states in the trade system.  Hard\nto see how it favours the weaker players.\n\nPeter Drahos\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
