Sometimes it gets replaced.\n\nSo long as war is the main business of nations, temporary despotism -- despotism during the campaign -- is indispensable.\n\nWhatever we expect with confidence becomes our own self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nAs love without esteem is capricious and volatile esteem without love is languid and cold.\n\nI slept, and dreamed that life was beauty I woke, and found that life was Duty.\n\nFaith makes: The uplook good, the outlook bright, the future glorious.\n\nI don't build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build.\n\nMake your life a happy one. That is where success is possible to every man.\n\n\n"}
