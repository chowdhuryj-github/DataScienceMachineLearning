So you could\ncreate your own scatterplot using the plot function, then call\nloess.smooth and use the lines function (with whatever parameters you\nwant) to add the line to the scatter plot.\n\nThis gives you as much control as you want over any of the details.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
