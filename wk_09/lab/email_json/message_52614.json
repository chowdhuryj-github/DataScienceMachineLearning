In order to compute the statistic of interest I only need theta and values. The idea of having X in there is that, if values is not provided by the user, then values is computed from X.\n\nmy problem is I'm trying to write consistency checks. For instance if i say\n\noutput <- myfun(beta, val1), how do I ensure that R reads this as passing arguments to \"theta\" and \"values\". In other words is it possible to bypass X completely if values is provided. Also how is it possible for R to recognize the second argument as being values and not X. This is important because X is a matrix and values is a vector. Therefore any checks using the dimensions of either one will land in trouble if it does not correctly capture that. \n\nThanks in advance\nSincerely\n\nAnup\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
