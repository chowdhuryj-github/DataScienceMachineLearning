The title of the presentation is \"Utility-Interactive Uninterruptible Power System for Private \"Island\" Grids\". \"Alternative Energy Sources are not generally suitable as stand alone power sources, operating independent of the Grid, but need to be matched to an appropriate form of energy storage before they can act to power an Island or MicroGrid. The storage is used to level the load for sources that are constant such as Fuel Cells, or to store excess energy and time shift the energy for intermittent or time-varying sources such as PV or Wind,\" said Dr. Leo Casey, SatCon's Chief Technology Officer. \"We have a long history of powering private Islands or MicroGrids, and connecting and disconnecting these islands from the Grid. Our continued work combines that background with our experience with Utility scale Alternative Energy and Energy Storage Inverters and Systems and our background in large facility backup power systems to enhance security and reliability of the MicroGrid and to improve power quality. The result is the ability to transform Distributed Generation sources which are of limited value in Grid outage situations, by coupling them with appropriate storage and transfer switching, to create robust MicroGrids based on Alternative Energy sources that can separate from the Grid and operate as a stable power island.\" About SatCon Technology Corporation SatCon Technology Corporation is a developer and manufacturer of electronics and generators/motors for the Renewable Energy, Hybrid-Electric Vehicle, Grid Support, High Reliability Electronics and Advanced Power Technology markets.
