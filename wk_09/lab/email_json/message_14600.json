The note distributed below to a Democratic\nlistserv aims to undermine support for Thailand's historic compulsory\nlicences by wrapping pharma's monopolistic practices in the call to\nsave \"American\" jobs! As this list knows, drug companies are\ntransnational, many not even headquartered in the US; and outsourcing\nis already their middle name. - Ellen Shaffer\n\n\n>[]\n>\n>\n>Thailand has been taken over by a military regime hostile to good\n>American jobs in our science industries.
