I just tried it\nlast week, and my attempts were a total failure.\n\nI created an image called c.img with the qemu-img command, or whatever\nit is. I stuck a floppy into the a drive. Then, in the folder where I\nhad c.img, from within cmd, the xp command prompt, I did:\n\nqemu -L c:\\progra~1\\qemu\\pcbios -serial com2 -fda a: -boot a c.img\n\nI also did\n\nqemu -L c:\\progra~1\\qemu\\pcbios -serial com2 -fda a: -boot a -hda c.img\n\nand neither of those worked. No floppy spin, no hd activity,\nnothing. I was just still in the cmd window, and the only things on\nthe screen were the command-line I typed, which seemed to be repeated\nfor the second time when I read the screen with wineyes, but the\nsecond time had pauses between the words in the reading (I.E. qemu\n... -fda ... a: ...) and so on.\n\nWhen I tried just:\n\nqemu -L c:\\progra~1\\qemu\\pcbios c.img\n\nIt worked, but qemu told me that c.img was not bootable. That's fine,\nbut how am I supposed to install an os in the first place? Any other\noptions besides that, even just adding -fda a: to the command-line\nmade it not work. Before you ask, yes, I did make an image of the\nfloppy under gnu/linux, and tried using the file, instead of the a:\ndrive, and yes, I did try leaving out the serial port, as well as the\n- -boot a option. No luck. The only thing that worked is just to specify\nthe path to the bios files, and c.img at the end, which I can't\nobviously boot from. If I left out the bios path and the -L flag, and\njust did qemu c.img, qemu complained that it couldn't find the bios,\nno surprise there.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 21, 2007 at 09:11:01AM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hiya,\n>     Just thought I'd throw this out there.  For those of you who are comfortable in command lines--most Speakup users, I'd say--I'v'e found an alternative to VMWare.  This is the open source and free software Qemu.  It is quite fast, and is able to emulate several types of CPU as well as different types of sound card, network card, etc.  Running under Windows I can create .bat files, and run different systems from each.  I'm currently trying to get LFS working--I know, it's a lot of waiting and compiling, but I've got time.
