As y is binary, I use \"class\" method and get the\nfollowing result.\n> rpart(y~x,data=dat,method=\"class\")\nn=778 (22 observations deleted due to missingness)\n\nnode), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob)\n      * denotes terminal node\n\n1) root 778 67 0 (0.91388175 0.08611825) *\n\n\nIf with the default method, I get such a result.\n\n> rpart(y~x,data=dat)\nn=778 (22 observations deleted due to missingness)\n\nnode), split, n, deviance, yval\n      * denotes terminal node\n\n1) root 778 61.230080 0.08611825\n  2) x< 19.5 750 53.514670 0.07733333\n    4) x< 1.25 390 17.169230 0.04615385 *\n    5) x>=1.25 360 35.555560 0.11111110 *\n  3) x>=19.5 28  6.107143 0.32142860 *\n\nIf I use 1.25 and 19.5 as the cutting points, change x into factor by\n>x2 <- cut(q34b,breaks=c(0,1.25,19.5,200),right=F)\n\nThe coef in y~x2 is significant and makes sense.\n\nMy problem is: is it OK use the default method in rpart when response\nvaribale is binary one?
