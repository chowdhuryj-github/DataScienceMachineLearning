I have 600E that runs\netch flawlessly except for the sound system and modem (which never work\nunder linux on any laptop in my experience) and some issues with the\nPCMCIA and USB ports.  But if someone had a DVD that would solve any or\nall of  those problems, I would be very keen:  I simply cannot afford a\ncouple of days per issue, which is what it usually takes even with a good\nADSL connection.\n\nrichard\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
