If so, then there is a\nlogical bug somewhere in the preceding 24 lines.  If you didn't expect\n$y to have a value then this is normal.  There are a couple ways of\nmaking the warning go away (note: you should only make the warnings go\naway if $y is expected to sometimes have no value).\n\n#probably the best way\nmy $y = param('sss');\n$y = '' unless defined $y;\n\n#a less verbose way that only works if \"0\" is not a valid input\nmy $y = param('sss') || '';\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
