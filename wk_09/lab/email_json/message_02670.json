In particular, SAS was designed from to store\ndata items on disk, and to read into core memory the minimum\nneeded for a particular calculation.\n\nThe kind of data SAS handles is (for the most part) limited to\nrectangular arrays, similar to R data frames. In many procedures\nthey can be read from disk sequentially (row by row), which\nundoubtedly simplifies memory handling.  It seems logical to\nsuppose that in developing SAS, algorithms were chosen to\nsupport that style of memory management. Finally, the style of\nwriting programs in SAS consists of discrete steps of\ncomputation, between which nothing but the program need be held\nin core memory.\n\n\n\"Gabor Grothendieck\"  wrote:\n\n> I think SAS was developed at a time when computer memory was\n> much smaller than it is now and the legacy of that is its better\n> usage of computer resources.\n> \n> On 4/10/07, Wensui Liu  wrote:\n> > Greg,\n> > As far as I understand, SAS is more efficient handling large data\n> > probably than S+/R.
