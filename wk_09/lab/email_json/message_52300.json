Do you have more thoughts on specifically how this could be distinguished from Etoys?\nAdditionally, there is the Sophie project, but I'm not that familiar with it or how far along they've come with the project on the XO.\n- EbenOn 6/21/07, Rebecca Gettys <rebecca.gettys@comcast.net> wrote:\nHello all,I had an idea while playing witha green machine...this may be a littlelate, I don't know.
