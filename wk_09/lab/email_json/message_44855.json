It's harmless.\n\nI haven't released eSpeak 1.26 yet.  You must have got it from the\ndevelopment page :-)\n\nThe problem was only that I didn't re-compile the phoneme data after i\nchanged the version number in the program code, so it thought the data\nwas for the wrong version of eSpeak.\n\nThe SourceForge  file release system seems to be not working at the\nmoment (unless I'm doing something wrong).\n\nBTW, I've improved the German spelling-to-phoneme rules, but there's\nstill a long way to go!\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
