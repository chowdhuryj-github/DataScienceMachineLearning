I was just making an observation.\n\nIt's just like forgetting that it actually costs something to burn a\nLinux distribution onto a CD and ship it to somebody. This doesn't\ninvalidate the whole concept of free Linux distributions, but it does\nrepresent costs which must be paid *somehow*.\n\nSpecially crafting a license which scuttles the means of recovering\nthose costs was, let's say \"sub-optimal\".\n\nI think a mental model of commons production that ignores the costs of\ndistribution can lead you to such sub-optimal results. It's fuzzy\nthinking, which IMHO reduces the credibility of the whole argument --\nregardless of its actual merits. :-)\n\nSo I have this tendency to mumble corrections under my breath when\nlistening to this kind of talk. Which doesn't necessarily invalidate the\nwhole argument -- but may do so in principle, so you have to second\nguess the speaker, and figure out for yourself whether the point\nmattered or not.\n\nOTOH, this is probably more text than the point really merits. ;-)\n\nCheers,\nTerry\n\n-- \nTerry Hancock (hancock@AnansiSpaceworks.com)\nAnansi Spaceworks http://www.AnansiSpaceworks.com\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
