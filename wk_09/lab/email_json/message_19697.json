Normally the the ipw2200 \nfile is extracted and the ipw2200-1.1.0 is made and installed.  Then the \nipw2200 fw 3.0 is unzipped and the four files are placed in \nthe/lib/firmware folder.\nEtch won't let me move files in the firmware folder, says I don't have \npermission.  If I choose change user from the \"Desktop\" menu, it won't \nlet me log in as root.  I'm at a loss as to how to make this happen.\nJim\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
