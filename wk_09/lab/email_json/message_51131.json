This is really strange.\n\nYes, but\n\n- the Matrix library is the file Matrix.so or Matrix.dll which\n is part of the installed (aka \"binary\") Matrix *package*\n Maybe you really need to read the result of\n    fortune(\"package.*Maechler\")  # after installing package 'fortunes'\n\n- \"please report\" was not meant to say to report to R-help,\n  but to the package maintainers,\n\n- since you cannot reproduce it yet, we cannot do much about it.\n  It may be a bug in the Matrix package (and Jose has told me\n  that he's using the latest released version 0.99875-2),\n  but in theory it could even be your own mistake, namely by\n  wrongly manipulating the slots of a Matrix object.\n\nPlease try to produce an R script - even if not small -- with a\nreproducible example;\n[and then do report to  Matrix-authors@r-project.org].\n\n    JQ> Thanks -- Jose Quesada, PhD.\n\nBest regards,\nMartin Maechler, ETH Zurich\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
