While && behaves properly when the condition turns out\nto be true, the result of the condition turning out to be false is\nwhatever the condition turned out to be.\n\nStill, Damian has a good point - which renders the bulk of this\ndiscussion moot.  The one thing left to consider (IMHO) is whether or\nnot it's worthwhile (or even possible) to go back to '$c ? $t : $f' or\nto '$c ? $t ! $f'.  As I said, the primary concern originally\nexpressed about the Perl 5 syntax involved matters of ambiguity which\nseem to have been resolved since then.  A case could be made that if\nthe Perl 5 syntax for this doesn't clash with the rest of Perl 6, it\nshould be used: anything else would be change for change's sake.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
