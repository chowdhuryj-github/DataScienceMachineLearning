The OpenSSL license has the\nobnoxious advertising clause\n\n * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software\n *    must display the following acknowledgement:\n *    \"This product includes cryptographic software written by\n *     Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)\"\n *    The word 'cryptographic' can be left out if the rouines from the library\n *    being used are not cryptographic related :-).\n\nThe current draft of GPLv3 allows some additional provisions such as\n\n  d. limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n  authors of the material; or\n\nbut nothing like the advertising clause.\n\nCheers,\nWalter Landry\nwlandry@ucsd.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
