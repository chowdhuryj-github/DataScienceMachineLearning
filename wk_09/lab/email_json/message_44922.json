Besides, practice forms a man to anything.\n\nAll you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.\n\nAll I want is a warm bed and a kind word and unlimited power.\n\nNothing resembles an honest man more than a cheat.\n\nThat a peasant may become king does not render the kingdom democratic.\n\nNot without a shudder may the human hand reach into the mysterious urn of destiny.\n\nLife is an offensive, directed against the repetitious mechanism of the Universe.\n\nWhen we remember that we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained.\n\nFor a manager to be perceived as a positive manager, they need a four to one positive to negative contact ratio.\n\nI will praise any man that will praise me.\n\nWhat the public criticizes in you, cultivate. It is you.\n\n\n"}
