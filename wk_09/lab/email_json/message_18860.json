(I think this is a good\nthing since it diminishes accidental or malicious changes). \n\nWith R the problem surfaces when trying to install packages.  The problem is\neasily mitigated by running R as the administrator and installing the\npackages or updates.  (Subsequent R sessions can be run by double clicking\non the icon, as usual.)  To do that, right-click on the program's icon and\nchoose \"Run as administrator.\"  Perhaps this will solve your RWinEdt\nproblems as well.\n\nBest wishes!\n\nCharles Annis, P.E.\n\nCharles.Annis@StatisticalEngineering.com\nphone: 561-352-9699\neFax:  614-455-3265\nhttp://www.StatisticalEngineering.com\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Dimitri Szerman\nSent: Saturday, April 28, 2007 11:51 AM\nTo: R-Help\nSubject: [R] RWinEdt and Windows Vista\n\nHi,\n\nI have a new computer with Windows Vista and I am trying to use\nRWinEdt, which I have always used. I am using R version 2.5.\n\nThe installation of the RWinEdt library is funny. First, it didn't\ninstall at all. Then, I uninstalled/reinstalled both R and WinEdt,\ndownloaded the package again from the CRAN repositary, got some error\nmessages, but RWinEdt initialized. I closed R and WinEdt, launched R\nagain, type \"library(RWinEdt)\", and got several dialogue boxes\n(again), asking if I wanted to creat shortcuts, etc. Then, RWinEdt\ndidn't work anymore.\n\nI'm sorry for the messy email, but I've done so many\ninstallations/uninstallations/re installations, that I am alos\nconfused.\n\nI guess the ultimate questions is: are there any known issued between\nR, RWinEdt and Windows Vista?\n\nI appreciate any help.\nThanks,\nDimitri\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
