I know that I can get the names of the imported variables with names(). It works. The variable \"ca\" consists of several elements. I want to get the names of the elements to handle my output better. But names(ca) doesn't work. Why? I did the following commands:\n> \n>> class(ca)\n> [1] \"array\"\n>> mode(ca)\n> [1] \"list\"\n>> dim(ca)\n> [1] 66  1  1\n>> length(ca)\n> [1] 66\n> \n> How can I now get the names which are stored in ca?
