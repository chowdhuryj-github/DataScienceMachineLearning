Does anybody know how hazard ratios are extracted\nfor each factor level in a stratified Cox proportional hazard\nregression model? I have a cancer data set where the variable\n?differentiation? is a factor with three levels: poor, intermediate and\ngood. I would like to extract the hazard ratio for each grade level and\nrelate it to another prognostic factor. I?ll appreciate very much if\nsomebody helps me sort out this.\n\nSincerely,\nDora\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
