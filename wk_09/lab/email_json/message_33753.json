For example, if you are\nmeasuring the density of some material, and you determine a lot\nof pairs (mass, volume), you know that mass = density * volume,\nwith intercept zero.\n\nAlberto Monteiro\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
