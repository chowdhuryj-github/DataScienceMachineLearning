Home is heaven for beginners.\n\nEvery man's life lies within the present for the past is spent and done with, and the future is uncertain.\n\nGuilt is the source of sorrows, the avenging fiend that follows us behind with whips and stings.\n\nThe greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work.\n\nThe destiny of man is in his own soul\n\nAll bodies are slow in growth but rapid in decay.\n\nThe bravest are the most tender the loving are the daring.\n\nWhen one has tasted it [Watermelon] he knows what the angels eat.\n\nThere are no uninteresting things, there are only uninterested people.\n\nIf other people are going to talk, conversation becomes impossible.\n\nDeath, so called, is a thing which makes men weep, and yet a third of life is passed in sleep.\n\nHe cannot be strict in judging, who does not wish others to be strict judges of himself.\n\n\n"}
