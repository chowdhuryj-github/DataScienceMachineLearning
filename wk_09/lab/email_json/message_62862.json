In 2005 and 2006, we brought you UIC2005 and UIC2006 in San Francisco. We now present UIC2007, our 4th annual Utility Integration Conference aimed at transforming utility performance and compliance.\n\u00a0\nUIC is focused on business improvement solutions for utilities and ISOs that harness the power of integration. These are people-process-technology solutions that result in total business integration by bridging organizational silos, streamlining end-to-end business processes, and connecting IT applications.\n\u00a0 \nCredible case studies suggest that such business integration can result in increased customer satisfaction, reliability, productivity, agility, and compliance. UIC provides a forum for sharing experiences of industry leaders who have begun integrating their business. \n\u00a0\nUIC promotes excellence in the utility industry by challenging you with the following questions about the \u201cmaturity\u201d of your business processes. Are they...\n\n Consistent and repeatable?\n Well documented and auditable?\n Favorably compared with best practices?\n Compliant with business rules and regulations?\n Instrumented to easily monitor, measure, and manage?\n Easy to learn?\n Easy and efficient to execute?\n Easy to change, improve, and optimize?\n\nToday, not many utilities can say YES to most of these questions. We can do better. \n\u00a0\nUIC2004, UIC2005, and UIC2006 showcased pioneering work of leading utilities who have applied business integration to improve processes such as outage restoration, asset management, maintenance management, work management, automated meter reading, demand response, and customer service.\n\u00a0 \nUIC2007 will present a wealth of additional case studies from leading utilities. You will also hear from business integration experts about valuable strategies, concepts, and tools such as Business Transformation, Organization Change Enablement, BPM Frameworks, Process Simulation, Business Intelligence, Predictive Enterprise, SOA Governance, and Semantics Integration. Technology vendors will share with you the latest innovations in integration technologies.\n\u00a0\nThe pre-conference training workshop will provide the requisite background and share best practices for implementing business integration at utilities.I want to acknowledge the critical role that the UIC2007 Advisory Board members have played in shaping this year\u2019s conference. I am grateful to them for their invaluable contributions. \n\u00a0\nI invite you to join our quest for improved performance of utilities. I look forward to meeting you in Houston at UIC2007.\n\u00a0\nAli Vojdani, Ph.D.\n                      Conference Chair\n                      President, UISOL\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n  Carbon \n                            Sequestration Development & Finance Summit\n  Houston, TX\n July 11-13, 2007\n  Coal Combustion \n                            Products\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  T & D Asset \n                            Management\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  Wind Power \n                            Development Tutorial\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 16-18, 2007\n  FERC Electric \n                            101\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 17-18, 2007\n  Electric Power \n                            Planning\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  NERC Reliability \n                            Standards\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  Project Finance \n                            Tutorial\n New \n                            York, NY\n July 23-25, 2007\n  Diversity and \n                            Inclusion- Best Practices\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-25, 2007\n  Energy \n                            Efficiency, Demand Response and Load Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-27, 2007\n  Revenue \n                            Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 26-27, 2007\n  New FERC Filing \n                            and FASB Fair Valuation Standards\n  Chicago, IL\n July 30-31, 2007\n  Power Delivery \n                            Planning: Managing the Distribution Planning Process to Maximize \n                            Value\n  Chicago, IL\n Aug 1-2, 2007\n  Electric Safety \n                            in Utilities\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 15-16, 2007\n  Protective \n                            Relaying\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 16-17, 2007\n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
