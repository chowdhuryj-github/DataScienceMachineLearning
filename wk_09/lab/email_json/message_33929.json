My understanding is that you\ncan take opposite colors on a color wheel, but there are of course various\ncolor wheels available. With \"colorspace\" you can experiment with this,\ne.g.:\n  x <- \"#81A9D0\"\n  y_hcl <- as(hex2RGB(x), \"polarLUV\")\n  y_hcl@coords[1, \"H\"] <- y_hcl@coords[1, \"H\"] + 180\n  y_hcl <- hex(y_hcl)\nwhich is a bit more balanced than\n  y_hsv <- as(hex2RGB(x), \"HSV\")\n  y_hsv@coords[1, \"H\"] <- y_hsv@coords[1, \"H\"] + 180\n  y_hsv <- hex(y_hsv)\n\nhth,\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
