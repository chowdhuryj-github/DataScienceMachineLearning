The problem is the following: I would like to\ncreate a data.frame with two components (columns), the first component being\na matrix and the second component a vector. Whatever I have tried so far, I\nend up with a data.frame containing all the columns from the matrix plus the\nvector which is not what I am after. I have seen this kind of data.frame\namong R example datasets (oliveoil and yarn).\n\nI would greatly appreciate some help with this problem!\n\nKind regards,\n\nLina Hultin Rosenberg\nKarolinska Biomics Center\nKarolinska Institute\nSweden\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
