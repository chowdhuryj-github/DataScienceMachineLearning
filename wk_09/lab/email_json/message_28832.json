Recently I have been confronted with \n> longitudinal data in a treatment vs. control analysis. My \n> dataframe is in the form of:\n> \n> subj | group | baseline | time | outcome (long) or subj | \n> group | baseline | time1 |...| time6 | (wide)\n> \n> The measured variable is a continuous one. The null \n> hypothesis in this analysis is that the Group factor does not \n> significantly influence the outcome variable. A secondary \n> null hypothesis is that the Group x Time interaction is not \n> significant, either. Visual of the group means indicates the \n> outcome measure decreases linearly (more or less) over time \n> from baseline values. The time==1...time==6 intervals are \n> equally-spaced and we have equal sample sizes for the groups.\n> \n> I've done a little reading around and found (at least) four \n> possible approaches:\n> \n> A. Linear mixed model using lme4 with random intercept and slope with\n> lmer() or lme()\n> \n> B. Repeated measures ANOVA using aov() with Error() \n> stratification (found in Baron & Li, 2006), something along \n> the lines of:\n> aov(outcome ~ group * time + baseline + Error(subj+subj:time))\n> \n> (from: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baron-rpsych.pdf, p. 41)\n> \n> C. \"Repeated measures\" MANOVA as follows (using data in wide format):\n> response <- cbind(time1,time2,time3,time4,time5,time6)\n> mlmfit <- lm(response ~ group)\n> mlmfit1 <- lm(response ~ 1)\n> mlmfit0 <- lm(response ~ 0)\n> # Test time*group effect\n> anova.mlm(mlmfit, mlmfit1, X=~1, test=\"Spherical\") # Test \n> overall group effect anova.mlm(mlmfit, mlmfit1, M=~1) # Test \n> overall time effect anova.mlm(mlmfit1, mlmfit0, X=~1, \n> test=\"Spherical\")\n> \n> (taken from http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/11/15744.html)\n> \n> Now, on with the questions:\n> \n> 1. This is really a curiosity. I find lmer() easier to use \n> than lme(), but the former does not allow the user to model \n> the correlation structure of the data. I figure lmer() is \n> presently assuming no within-group correlation for the data, \n> which I guess is unlikely in my example. Is there a way to \n> compare directly (maybe in terms of\n> log-likelihood?) similar models fitted in lme() and lmer()?\n> \n> 2. Baron & Li suggest a painful (at least for me) procedure \n> to obtain Greenhouse-Geisser or Huyn-Feldt correction for the \n> ANOVA analysis they propose. Is there a package or function \n> which simplifies the procedure?\n> \n> 3. I must admit that I don't understand solution C. I can \n> \"hack\" it to fit my model, and it seems to work, but I can't \n> seem to grasp the overall concept, especially regarding the \n> outer and/or inner projection matrices (M & X). Could anyone \n> point me to a basic explanation of the procedure?\n> \n> 4. Provided the assumptions for ANOVA hold, or that \n> deviations from them are not horrible, am I correct in saying \n> that this procedure would be the most powerful one? How would \n> you choose solution A over solution B (or viceversa)?\n> \n> My sincerest gratitude to anyone who will take the time to \n> answer my questions!\n> \n> Best Regards,\n> \n> Marco\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
