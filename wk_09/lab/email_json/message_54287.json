In this case, not only can the\npre-flop be decisive, but the board as well.\nOur\nadvice is not to be too selective with\nyour opening hand, trying to hit more: your advantage is to be unpredictable. \nIs it\nbetter to emphasize more on the flop or on the opening hand? And how should you\nadapt to the post-flop strategy? \nIt always\npays to be aggressive on the\npre-flop! Sometimes you have to face opponents playing quite bad in post-flop,\nand in this case, you can use the\nsituation to your advantage. Put maximum pressure on them, and make them\nask themselves lots of questions, get them to pay in order to discover if you are bluffing or not.\nThis is\nthe very essence of Poker, mainly of\nno-Limit: making your opponents\nplay, not the cards!\nGood\ncards are not there to wait for you all the time: you have to seize your\nopportunity the moment you feel that your\nopponent can be easily defeated. \nTry this\nnew winning strategy, and check out other online gaming tips at the Titan Poker website.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -----------------------------------------------\nTitan Poker \u00a0click here to visit \nFreerolls up to $550\neveryday on simple registration, without making any deposit.\nSpecial welcome bonus entering bonus code WD500\nat the registration\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n100%\nbonus up to $500 For example when you make a deposit of $50 you are\ngetting a $50 bonus.
