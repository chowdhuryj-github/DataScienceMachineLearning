I chose the Nine of Pentacles, and that tells me that you are about to go through a period of introspection.  I have always been fond of this card, and I want you to know that it indicates that you are entering a period of satisfaction and bliss, but not the typical kind.  You should feel safe and contented with what you have in life, without longing for much more.  The universe works in strange ways.  One important life lesson that I'll share with you is that gratitude for our blessings makes even more abundance comes through for us.  The Nine of Pentacles tells me that you are apt to feel thankful for the good things in your life.  You can sit back now and enjoy the bountiful fruits of your labor, even if it's just emotional satisfaction that you feel for now.  You may not be surrounded by a lot of people at this moment, but you are not likely to feel lonely at all.  You can find your happiness within yourself right now, rather than looking outside of yourself for life's delights.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This week begins with a real burst of energy and ideas.\u00a0 The Sun enters Gemini, joining Mercury, which in turn is linking up with both expansive Jupiter and unpredictable Uranus.\u00a0 Expect the phone to ring off the hook, Memo, and to bump into folks who just love to chat each time you leave your home.\u00a0 This is a time for planning rather than doing, as there's little practical help from the planets, because none of them are occupying earth signs.\u00a0 But the Moon passing through Virgo on Thursday and Friday helps you get urgent chores done.\n\n\n\n\n\nMemo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May 21 - May 27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, I want you to take maximum advantage of the luck coming your way this week.

There's nothing wrong with taking the day off.  Curl up with your favorite book, movie, or TV shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You could discover a hidden talent quite by accident.  Be sure to develop this gift through classes and instruction.  You can't afford to let this ability go to waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A heavy work load could weigh you down.  Arrange to spend a quiet time by yourself this evening.
