My code and help files work through\nsmoothly when I run Rcmd check. However, examples couldn't pass the check.\nThe reason maybe that the data files I wanted to use were not created and\nloaded. What I have done is the following:\n\n1. use \"save\" command to save two data lists as .rda files;\n2. put .rda files in the data folder of the package;\n3. load data in the example using \"data\" command;\n4. run my R code for the example.\n\nI have difficulties to pass Rcmd check before building the package. My\nexample codes can run through in R console without any problems. I don't\nknow how to solve this problem. Can some experts in the package building\nhelp me? Thank you very much in advance.\n\nDeli\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
