For the survival time l would like to have treatment 1-strata 1  using a different rate  from treatment 2 -strata 2 etc to generate the  survival time.\n    \n    the program l used above does nt do this so if you can help\n \n---------------------------------\nFinding fabulous fares is fun.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
