I think we just\nneed agreement.  We have too much code reformatting (based\non personal preference) in our patches.   There's been a\nloose agreement on formatting in the past and I've never\nbeen a big fan of Coding Style rules.  But as we try to\nexpand the developer pool, an unspoken agreement is insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGf+b6IR7qMdg1EfYRAmwcAKCsKuAzjDNqj4osEcBHMqaaKnM5LACglfee\n/zGEB12sRUtRahqCMv7uUX4=\n=A5S7\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
