Mainly\n* We landed the new Presence Service.* We are heavily refactoring the Graphics API and controls.* We started to integrate the new Data Store.Also, not as exciting:* We are switching back to Python \n2.4 in sugar-jhbuild. (It's unclear iffinal will actually use 2.5 as initially planned and it's really bad tokeep developing on 2.5 in sugar-jhbuild and build images with 2.4).As a result we have a lot of new dependencies. Yesterday I spent some\ntime to rationalize the jhbuild modules structure.I dropped the build-base phase because it was getting too complicated tomaintain. jhbuild has commands to rebuild single or part of the modulesanyway.\nIf you are brave enough go ahead, do a clean rebuild and let us knowabout the problems. Most of the activities will not work because of theAPI changes, that's known.Marco_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing listSugar@laptop.orghttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n"}
