As to why it keeps saying \"No such\nfile or directory\", well, if I remember correctly $! is the system\ncall errno, not the return from system.  I think you want $?\n(specifically $? >> 8).  Here is what I think you want\n\nsystem(\"perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0 ajtest\") == 0\n    or die \"vplan_all failed with an exit code of \" . ($? >> 8);\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
