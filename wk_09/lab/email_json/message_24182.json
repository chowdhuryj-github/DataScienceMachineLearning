I suppose it might not be a bad idea to copy some of the text at\nthe URL above into debian/copyright.\n\n> I dislike the FDL because of all these complexities and stange interactions\n> when an FDL'd manual accompanies GPL'd software.  GPL the manuals!\n\nI entirely agree with you, but the GCC steering committee is of the\nopinion that there is no chance of persuading RMS to sign off on it.\n[I do not know whether they ever tried, but I think they're right.\nJoseph, again, might know more.]\n\nzw\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
