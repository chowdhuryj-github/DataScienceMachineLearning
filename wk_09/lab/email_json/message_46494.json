The reason I wanted to use textpad is to make use of\nthe syntax highlighting a la SAS.\n\nSo I installed textpad and according to the instructions given in\nhttp://www.data-for-all.com/blog/?p=68  .  everything worked out fine until\nI ran the following test code:\n\n\n*setwd('C:/Temp/SampleR')\n#\nN<-250\nx<-1:N\ny<-0.53*x +rnorm(x, 0.42*N, 0.14*N)\nmodel1<-lm(y~x)\nprint(summary(model1)) *\n\nOnce I submitted the R code using the SUBMIT R FILE in TOOLS from the\ntoolbar menu the following message displayed.\n\n\nThe filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.\n\nTool completed with exit code 1\n\n\n\nNow even If I run a simple code like *a<-10;a* still the same message is\ndisplayed.\n\n\n\nI am kind of sure it is nothing wrong with the code but something is wrong\nwith the way the textpad installation. Any help? I am not a techie person.\n\nThx for your help\n\nOn 6/11/07, Mary Royerr  wrote:\n>\n> I have installed textpad and tried running R code.
