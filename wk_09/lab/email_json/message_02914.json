I have \nbeen thinking a lot before I made this first step and I hope you accept it \nand support me.\nI have read your profile and found a lot of common between us. I like \ntraveling, swimming, walking along the sea shore, theatre. I am cheerful and \nenergy, well balanced and flexible person.  I don't have too many dislikes. \nWhat I don't want to do, I don't do.  I seldom have contact with people that \ncarry around too many dislikes. If there is hope to remedy them, I tell \nthem. People fail in life most because they don't say what they really want. \nAnd this is the reason why they accumulate dislikes. What do I like? Some of \nit you have already learned from my profile: I like my life, my job, and the \nway I've developed as a person over the years.\nI think it is not polite to start all sentences from \"I\" or \"I am\". I would \nlike to hear something about you. Tell me more about yourself. I am here to \nmeet my beloved and special ONE.  I wish him to understand my inner world \nand to share his rich inner world.\nToday I had felt the smell of spring outside and I believe hot sunny summer \nwill come soon though the streets are full of snow. My dreams about YOU are \nrealistic as well. I hope to get letter from you \nat http://flirtwithmedirect.com/sweetkiss to start our \ncommunication and will be pleased to answer your questions you may have. \n\n\nWaiting for your response\n\nAnastasya\n\n\n"}
