Only you must be carrrefuly if you have on your system\n.asoundrc which is not compatible with a new version of alsa but if you\nhave a new linux installation then will be OK.\n\n\nFor playing you need alsa clients or for oss client you can install\nalsa-oss on debian for example. Then you can play with command: aoss\nplaycommand FILE .\n\nBest\n\n-- \n\nJan Buchal\nTel: (00420) 24 24 86 008\nMob: (00420) 608023021\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
