'cls' !! 'clear');\n\nIs it already legal syntax to write, or, if not, would it be possible\nand desirable to allow:\n\n      system('cls' !! 'clear' ?? ($?OS eq any ));\n\n?\n\nIf your answer is that it's not yet legal but perhaps ought to be,\nthen can this be done outside of core (a macro perhaps?) or would it\nhave to be part of core?\n\nIf your answer is no, then how best would one express what the above\nis trying to, retaining the endweighting of alternatives at start,\nselection logic at end?\n\nFinally, but very importantly imo, what if there are 3 or more\nalternatives?\n\nlove, raiph\n\n"}
