If you have simple box constraints, you can use the \"L-BFGS-B\" method in optim.  If not, optim may not be directly applicable, unless you can somehow transform your problem into an unconstrained minimization problem. \n\nRavi.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: domenico pestalozzi \nDate: Wednesday, July 4, 2007 11:26 am\nSubject: Re: [R] how to solve a min problem\nTo: R-help \n\n\n> S is an array 1-dimensional, for example 1 X 10, and mean(S) is the \n> mean of\n>  these 10 elements.\n>  \n>  So, I want to do:\n>  \n>  minimize mean(S) with 0 < b_func(S) < 800.\n>  That is, there are some boundaries on S according the b_funct\n>  \n>  The function apply an iterative convergent criterion:\n>  \n>  f_1=g(S), f_2=g(f_1), f_3=g(f_2), ecc....\n>  The function stops when\n>  f_n - f_n-1 <=0.1e-09\n>  and g(S) is a non-linear function of S and the convergence is mathematically\n>  assured.\n>  \n>  Is it possible to use  'optimize'?\n>  \n>  thanks\n>  \n>  domenico\n>  \n>  \n>  2007/7/3, Spencer Graves :\n>  >\n>  >      Do you mean\n>  >\n>  >      minimize mu with 0 < b_func(S+mu) < 800?\n>  >\n>  >      For this kind of problem, I'd first want to know the nature of\n>  > \"b_func\".
