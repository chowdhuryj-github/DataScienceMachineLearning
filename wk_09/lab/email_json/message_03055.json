The 600e\nrecognizes the card and sees the network (evidence in iwconfig\noutput), but dhclient fails to get a lease.  The LED on the lucent\nlights up, but doesn't blink as much as it does with my x31.  I\nbelieve they're both using orinoco_cs, and the same version of\ndhclient (3.0.4).\n\nAny ideas of where to troubleshoot next?\n\nGabe\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
