It replace the previous plot every time I call a new levelplot. I can't put them into the same matrix and plot them all at once because the scale of each data type is very different, i.e.g probability=c(0,1), days=c(0,10), etc. I'm wondering if you could suggest a way to solve this problem.\n>\n\nIt all depends on the details.

Again, please give details.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
