OMG Tubes!\n\nTubes are an application-level protocol (strictly speaking, extensions\nto each of several application-level protocols, with a common API).\n\nThe reason OLPC apps are expected to use Tubes is that they integrate with\nTelepathy contacts (which we use for Buddy communication/identification) and\nhave a common API regardless of whether you're using local sockets on the\nmesh, forwarding through a server, traversing through NATs (in future\nversions), etc. - if you write an app to use Tubes for mesh communication,\nit'll also work for communication across the world via an XMPP server.\nThe Telepathy connection manager will work out the right way to get the\nbytes to the other participants.\n\nYou can't just open a socket and do TCP/UDP if the peers aren't behind the\nsame NAT (e.g. collaboration between two schools, or a child at school and a\nchild in an internet cafe).\n\n\tSimon\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
