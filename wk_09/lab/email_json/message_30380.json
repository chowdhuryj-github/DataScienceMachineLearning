For\neach given directory $dir in its argument list, the lib pragma also checks\nto see whether a directory named $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so, the\n$dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding platform-specific\ndirectory, so is added to @INC (in front of $dir).\n**************************************\n\nI definitely want this, because I have different platforms (os x, linux,\nirix) running this script and I'd like them to use the module binary\ncorresponding to it...\n\nAnybody know how I can make that work?\n\n- B\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
