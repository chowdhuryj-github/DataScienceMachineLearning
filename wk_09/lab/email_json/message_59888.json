Gentoo logo artwork\nlicense is available at http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/name-logo.xml\n\nI'm asking about this because Gentoo logo have two different license\nfor commercial\nand not commercial use. And I decided to remove GRUB splash screen that shows\nGentoo logo form grub-splashsimages package, as it was requested in bug #266480.\n\nUnfortunately it breaks GRUB installation that uses this logo. I'd\nlike to add it back.\nThis artwork is still in stable version of grub-splashsimages.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nKrzysztof Burghardt \nhttp://www.burghardt.pl/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
