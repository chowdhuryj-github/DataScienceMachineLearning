In order to talk\nabout that intelligently, we have to look at specific instances of the\nsymbol's use in a specific font within a specific package and the\nprocess that resulted in creating the glyph.\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nIf you have the slightest bit of intellectual integrity you cannot\nsupport the government. -- anonymous\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
