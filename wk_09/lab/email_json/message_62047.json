I have Fedora 7 so I cannot really check what my entry would look\nlike. I recently installed Kubuntu on a friends notebook so there the\nreadme from http://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html\ndid actually work. I just had a second look at your mail so could it be\nthat there is a missing slash after feisty? If that does not work try\nanother mirror like\n\ndeb http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/linux/ubuntu/ feisty/\n\nthere is also no main stated there in the readme... sorry I copied that\nfrom your mail so thats obviously not following the readme...\n\nI hope this works now.\n\nStefan\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-\n...
