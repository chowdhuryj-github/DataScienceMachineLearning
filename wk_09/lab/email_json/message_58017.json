The problem with using 'source' is that the user environment gets\ncluttered.\n\nI 'save' the most useful functions to a single file (\"MMmisc.Rda\"), put it\nin the HOMEPATH directory (use Sys.getenv(\"HOMEPATH\") to find where that\nis), then I put the line\n\nattach(what=paste(Sys.getenv(\"HOMEPATH\"), \"MMmisc.Rda\", sep=\"/\"))\n\nin Rprofile.site in C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.5.0\\etc folder.\n\nWorks for me! You don't have the luxury of help files, etc, but it's easy to\nupdate.\n\nHTH -- Mike.\n\n\nGavin Simpson wrote:\n> \n> On Thu, 2007-06-28 at 17:29 +0800, R. Leenders wrote:\n>> ...
