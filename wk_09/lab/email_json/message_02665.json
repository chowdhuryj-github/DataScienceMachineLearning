Printer is already working to make a hardcopy.\n\nTo your problem:\nEven voting which harmonics are for which fundamental is difficult, \nsince for polyphony, the problem is not identifiable (i.e. there is no \ngeneral unique solution; e.g. quints, octaves etc. do share some \npartials) ...\n\nI know of some heuristics by a physician in our university who has \ninvented an algorithm (still unpublished) that extracts the partials \n(and of course has the problems mentioned above for polyphony) on its \nway to another target. We (i.e. a phd student rather than me) are in the \nprogress of trying to implement the algorithm - which appears to be \nrather complicated  ...\n\nBest,\nUwe\n\n\n> Hadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
