The pain of trying to keep in it the 3.0.26 tree\nwhile moving to the PIDL generated server and client stubs\nis unnecessary IMO.\n\nI would like to remove it form SAMBA_3_0_26 and siable it\nin the SAMBA_3_0 tree (but leave it in place in case someone\nwants to revisit it after the migration to PIDL is finished).\n\nCOmments?\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXzlAIR7qMdg1EfYRAoTtAJ0aGHeb5JRH3tdqrvFq4lj228wATQCgw3hP\nxYOjiVd16nC7FUrv1aZfUC4=\n=BRnQ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
