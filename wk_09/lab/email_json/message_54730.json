I've just done a major upgrade of my M70 laptop, running\nGentoo Linux, and i've got an application which integrates: Geant4.8.3,\nOpenSceneGraph-2.0, and Histoscope\nhttp://fermitools.fnal.gov/abstracts/histoscope/abstract.html.\n\nThe upgrade included moving to gcc-4.1.1 (previously gcc-3.3.5, circa 2005),\nunder which histoscope no-longer compiles.  I've managed to get it hacked\ntogether via a binary from the old disk, and having the gcc-3.3.5 associated\nlibs available on the new disk, as well, but it's still a hack.\n\nSo, that's where I'm coming from.  Thank you, R community, for such nice\nsoftware!\n\nCharles Cosse\n\nOn 6/23/07, Prof Brian Ripley < ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk> wrote:\n>\n> On Sat, 23 Jun 2007, Charles Cosse wrote:\n>\n> > Hello,\n> >\n> > sorry if this is a duplicate message -- the R mail-server told me that\n> my\n> > original post was being held for moderator approval.
