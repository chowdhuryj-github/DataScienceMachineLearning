The \ndocumentation states that it calculates t(Q) %*% y via a previously \nperformed QR matrix decomposition.\n\nIn order to do that, I tried following basic example:\n\nm<-matrix(c(1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1),ncol=3) # 4x3 matrix\nqr.qty(qr(m),matrix(c(1,2,3,4,2,3,4,5,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2),nrow=4))\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]   -1   -2   -1   -2\n[2,]   -4   -5   -1   -2\n[3,]    3    4    1    2\n[4,]   -2   -3   -1   -2\n\nAs far as I understood the documentation a call such as\n\nt(qr.Q(qr(m)))%*%matrix(c(1,2,3,4,2,3,4,5,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2),nrow=4)\n\nshould produce the same result, but this produces a 3 by 4 rather than a \nfour by four matrix as t(qr.Q(qr(m))) has only three rows.\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]   -1   -2   -1   -2\n[2,]   -4   -5   -1   -2\n[3,]    3    4    1    2\n\n\nSo the last line is missing. Any hints how R adds the last line would be \nappreciated.\n\nRegards,\nSebastian\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
