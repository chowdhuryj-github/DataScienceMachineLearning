I'm trying to accomplish a search and replace in a number of files in the same directory from the command line (cmd.exe). The problem is that the command perl -i -e \"s/old/new/\" * fails silently, i.e. no changes take place. My question is: does * indicate all files in the current directory (this did work in the Windows version of sed I tried)? I cannot find this in the docs or using Google. Or am I making another mistake?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nJohn Degen \n\n-- \nSane sicut lux seipsam, & tenebras manifestat, sic veritas norma sui, & falsi est. -- Spinoza\n\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet your own web address.  \nHave a HUGE year through Yahoo!
