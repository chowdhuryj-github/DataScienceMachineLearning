Basically I want to overload the function\nin C++ talk, so if I give foo and object of type A something (and this\nis my question) dispatches the call to, say, foo.A, and if I give foo\nand object of type B something dispatches the call to, say, foo.B.\n\nI want to write foo.A and foo.B. How to I perform the method \ndispatch? From what I understand there are two ways in R:\nS3 and S4. What is the simple S3 way?\n\nThanks!\n\nJack.\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
