Serial ports just work,\nsince speakup isn't taking them as under linux. The disadvantage is that\nwindows is very unstable, to the point of needing to be rebooted every\ncupple of days.\n\nIf you run vmware under linux and emulate windows, the windows at least for\nme was sort of slow. Also, sharing between the two operating systems will be\nan issue - either way. Samba can help with that, or windows file sharing on\nthe windows side.\n- - Tyler\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (FreeBSD)\n\niD8DBQFGHPbrTsjaYASMWKQRAkkUAJ9RD5tcLtzuvZWJ1h0ueLaoD+gtaQCePMgZ\nwY43UECWrvrN7gjYI/t4eyE=\n=dnZt\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
