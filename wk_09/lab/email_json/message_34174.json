A simple wiki will not work, since it will be necessary in each browser window to display the four fields for legislation, comments, draft model language and motivation for model language. However perhaps an more complex wiki might work.We would also like the ability to track who said what when and what changes we've made.ThanksAndrew Rens\nNever miss an email again!Yahoo!
