Do a clean install on the\nmachine you want to run it on.\n\nSay what? This is not true, I have done it dozens of times. I have in \nfact set up machines as build machines for others. The only thing that\nis \"molded\" is the kernel. As said in recent thread, what you need is \na generic kernel, not pentium or amd specific. To be more clear, in \nthe kernel config, you want 386 processor:\n\nSubarchitecture Type\nPC-compatible  (CONFIG_X86_PC)\n\nProcessor family \n386  (CONFIG_M386) \n\nA 386 kernel will boot on anything. You also want generic chipset\nstuff, not anything specific to the original hardware. The easiest way\nto achieve this is to get one of the already made generic kernels, \nthe ones that boot when you run an install. On slackware that is \ncalled bare.i, it will boot on anything! Equivalents are available on \nother distros. And repeating what I said before: if a kernel will \nnot boot on any system, boot with floppy or cd, load the kernel\nfrom that media but use the root= parameter to boot into the \nroot on the hard drive. This has never failed for me unless the\ndrive is toast. You need to catch the boot: prompt and do \nsomething like \n\nboot: bare.i root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro \n\nwhere bare.i is the name of your generic kernel. You should\nbe able to find a generic kernel for debian. Once you have \nbooted from the CD or floppy, with the root= to your hard\ndrive, you have a running system, build a kernel on the target\nand then update bootloader. It is definitely possible to move \ndrives from one machine to another. \n\n  -- Spie\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
