It provides no semantic search featurewhatsoever,\nand can't, because Perl's documentation wasn't built like that.\n\nThe documentation for CGI is very different from the documentation for\nIO::Socket::INET, although both are (can be) OO.\n\nThat's okay if you read the things like a book, but structured\ndocumentation with structured interfaces allow readers to more easily\nuse the documentation for reference.\n\n> Let the same thing happen with Perl 6: allow innovation, and if you, or\n> Markov, or anybody creates a particularly fine site then people will\n> admire it, use it ... and then perhaps it can be made official.\n\nSure, but it's a huge chicken-egg problem that doesn't have to exist.\n\n> There isn't really anything to be gained by pre-empting this and picking\n> something initially.\n\nI disagree very strongly.\n-- \nkorajn salutojn,\n\n  juerd waalboer:  perl hacker   \n  convolution:     ict solutions and consultancy \n"}
