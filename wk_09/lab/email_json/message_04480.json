How can I force the fonts (just default fonts) to\nbe embedded. embedFonts seems to only embed unusual fonts, not the\ndefault ones that are used in a simple eps generated by using\n\"postscript\".\n\nI've tried:\n\nps2pdf14 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress bland-altman_v2.eps bland-altman_v2.pdf\npdftops -eps bland-alman_v2.pdf bland-altman_v2_embed.eps\n\nbut the box size is wrong and I don't know how to correct it - if I\ncorrect the bounding box in bland-altman_v2_embed.eps, the size is\ncorrect but not all of the figure shows. The reference I found mentions\nfixing the \"box size\" but doesn't say how this is done.\n\nI would appreciate any insight on this.\n\nRick B.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
