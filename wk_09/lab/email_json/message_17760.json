But I can't find it happening anywhere in the code you posted.\n\nA single quoted string is just syntax for a literal string. But double\nquoted strings in Perl may be more than just literal strings; they can\nimplicitly invoke join() or concatenation, for example. Still, in the\ncode you posted, your strings are merely string literals, with no\ninterpolation going on. Single quotes would have worked as well.\n\nSometimes, people have the idea that 'fred' is a different string than\n\"fred\". But they're analogous to writing 255.0 versus 255.00000; even\nthough they look different to human eyes, they mean the same to Perl.\n\nMaybe the quote marks made a difference in another program, such as a\ntext editor? Or maybe you fixed a missing quote mark when you changed\nfrom singles to doubles? In any case, I'm glad that you were\nsuccessful.\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
