I know this is not\ncurrent, but I'm on a machine used and administered by others, and\nupdating libxml2 would require updating libc, and things get pretty\ncomplicated from there.\n\nTrying to install through R (1.9-0), I eventually get the error:\nXMLTree.c: In function `xmlBufferWrite': \nXMLTree.c:729: error: void value not ignored as it ought to be \nmake: *** [XMLTree.o] Error 1 \n\nI manually downloaded version 1.8-0 and got the same problem.  I took a\nlook at that part of the code, but do not understand enough to start\ntinkering with it.  I was able to install an earlier version a couple of\nyears ago, and it was extremely useful (thanks!) but the relevant\nmachine has been decommissioned.\n\nCan you make any suggestions about which component of my system this\nmight indicate needs to be changed?  I checked the mailing list\narchives, but didn't find anything.  I'm hoping there's an alternative\nto changing libxml2, with all the cascading requirements that would\nbring (and no guarantee, with what I know now, that that's the problem).\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt Wiener\n\n> version\n               _\nplatform       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\narch           x86_64\nos             linux-gnu\nsystem         x86_64, linux-gnu\nstatus\nmajor          2\nminor          4.1\nyear           2006\nmonth          12\nday            18\nsvn rev        40228\nlanguage       R\nversion.string R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotice:  This e-mail message, together with any attachments,...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
