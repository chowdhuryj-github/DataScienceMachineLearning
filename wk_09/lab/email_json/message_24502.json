According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.\nRemember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!\n\n--\nIf you have any more questions please contact to me.\nPlease include all previous messages in your email's.\n-------------------------------------------\nThank you and best regards\nRoosevelt Jorgensen\nEmail: ldahfxx@kotnet.org\nWWW: http://bemkkt.administr.com/?einacwejszpv\n\n\n\n\n"}
