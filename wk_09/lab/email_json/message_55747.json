A good explanation of the problems with this exact \napproach, that\nis adding up the sums of squares of the individual functions,  is described\nin Numerical Recipes for C, second edition, p 382 (see \nhttp://www.nrbook.com/a/bookcpdf.php)\nBriefly there will often be a great number of local minima even when \nthere is only a single\nroot of the original equations.\n\nRob\n\n\n\n\n\nRavi Varadhan wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> I have written a simple function to solve a system of nonlinear equations.\nI\n> have called it nlsolve().
