To do much less of it. \n\n\nHe wants people to make many more decisions at a local level, and take much more control over running their communities - harnessing the philosophy of the \"wiki-generation\".\n\n\n\"Every time we see a problem, we don't just ask what government can do. We ask what people can do, what society can do. That's the big difference between us and Zombie Brown, \" he said.\n\n\nIs it right to devolve power in this way or should we leave it to the politicians we elect to make decisions on our behalf? Is it achievable? Is it something politicians find easy to promise in opposition, but harder to deliver on in government? Is it a new idea, or is it one that is fundamental to the idea of Conservatism anyway?\n\n\nTell us what you think.\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO POST YOUR COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \nSEARCH BBC NEWS\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make changes or cancel your newsletter visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email/newsnight\n\nTo sign up for other newsletters or the personalised BBC Daily E-mail visit:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/email\n\nIf you have an editorial related comment, e-mail mailto:newsnight@bbc.co.uk?subject=email\n\nProblems with links?
