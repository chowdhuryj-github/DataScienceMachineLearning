We include plenty of copyrighted\nmaterials which are DFSG-free.\n\nIf by \"legal composition of copyright\" you mean \"license texts are used to\nindicate how other things are copyrighted, and cannot do that if they are\nmodified\", that's wrong.  You're assuming that \"modifying a license\" means \n\"trying to relicense the thing the license is attached to\".  That's incorrect.\nOne might want to modify a license in order to reuse the license somewhere\nelse.  Modifying a license in this way has no bearing on the licensing of\nthe work to which the license was originally attached, and the copyright of\nthe work does not restrict modifying the license this way.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
