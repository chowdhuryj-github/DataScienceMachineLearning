The TechBlog \nis where CC/SC software people, interns, Summer of Code students, etc \ncan blog about the technical side of things at Creative Commons.  We \nplan to blog about things which may be of interest to software \ndevelopers or technologists, but which don't rise to the level of \ngeneral interest to make them relevant to the main CC blog.\n\nCheck it out at http://techblog.creativecommons.org.\n\nNathan\n\n-----\nNathan R.
