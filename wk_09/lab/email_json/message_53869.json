The BSD init setup is strange \nafter working in System V.  I have a really strange problem.  I saved a \nfew of my own aliases in a file called .aliases, and then made and added \nthe lines to .bashrc:\n\necho 3 > /proc/speakup/rate\nsource ~/.aliases\n\n     It didn't work, so I unaliased all of my aliases and tried again. \nThat didn't work either, so I deleted every single file in the home \ndirectory, deleted every alias, logged out, logged vack in, and guess \nwhat?  The stoopid default aliases were back!  wtf?  Is Windows haunting \nmy Linux drive now?  Anyone know how to get rid of the default aliases \nand add my own?  .bashrc doesn't seem to work in Slack for some odd \nreason, and yeah, I'm using bash.  Ran Debian for over two years, so I'm \nnot TOO stupid.   Thank the gods I'm running sendmail.  Best \nnews I've had since January.  I wonder if there's a way to generate an \ninstalled  package list.\n\n         Michael\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
