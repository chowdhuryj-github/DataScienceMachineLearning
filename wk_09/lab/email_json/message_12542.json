As I've tried to\ntell him for years, this is a problem that needs solving by Speakup.\nSpeakup simply needs to deactivate itself in the gui environment. No\nother solution is rational. It is unacceptable to have to kill Speakup\nby hand, and it seems that doesn't even work for some. Surely, we\nshoulden't have to choose between Speakup and Orca?\n\nJanina\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
