OTOH if message elements can contain\nmixed content (embedded markup like  for example),\nthen that would be a reason to avoid XML::Simple.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n--\nmirod\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
