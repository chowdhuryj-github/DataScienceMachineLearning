Is there an easy way to install (or load, if that's the easier way) those packages under 2.5.0, without having to install each package by hand?\n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
