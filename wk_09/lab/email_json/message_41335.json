This is not the\ncase for the FDL, and certainly not for works combining GPL and FDL\ncovered works.\n\n> the further modifications Debian claims they need are not needed;\n\nFortunately, the DFSG is drafted to let the *recipient* decide what\nmodifications they need to make to the work.\n\n> invariant sections are *tiny* in comparison with the rest of the GNU\n> manuals\n\nWe're not discussing GNU manuals. We're discussing works under the\nFDL, a license that is available for anyone to apply to their works.\n\n> I doubt that the FSF would sue for GFDL compliance\n\nAgain, the FDL is available for any party to apply to their work, so\nspeculation as to what the FSF would or would not do doesn't seem to\nbe relevant here.\n\n> Also, it just doesn't make sense to modify some things\n\nFortunately, the DFSG requires that works be licensed such that the\nrecipient of the work can decide what modifications make sense.\n\n-- \n \\       \"I filled my humidifier with wax.
