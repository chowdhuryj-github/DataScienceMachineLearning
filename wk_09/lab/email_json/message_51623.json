Iraqi insurgents\n  joined 10,000 U.S. troops\n  in the offensive and took control of several areas north of Baghdad today. David Martin will have the\n  latest.\n\u00a0\nAnd our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan will update\n  us on the orphanage story she reported on Monday. She\u2019ll give us some\n  encouraging news about how the once-neglected Baghdad orphans are doing now. \n\u00a0\nBack in the United\n   States, a South\n    Carolina community is beginning the process of\n  mourning nine firefighters who died in massive furniture factory blaze.\n  Tonight, Kelly Cobiella will share the story of one man who escaped from the\n  inferno. \n\u00a0\nAnd there\u2019s extraordinary new animation that\n  shows more clearly than we\u2019ve seen before why the World Trade\nCenter towers collapsed\n  on 9/11 after being hit by airplanes.\n\u00a0\nWhat if a Web site could tell you that going to one\n  hospital in your area rather than another could dramatically improve your\n  odds of survival? Now, one has been set up by the U.S. government. Wyatt Andrews\n  will give you all the details.\n\u00a0\nFinally, it\u2019s been 35 years since the\n  Watergate scandal drove former President Richard Nixon out of office. Now\n  historians at the National Archives are poring over his speeches, gifts and\n  recordings \u2013 yes, even that 18 \u00bd minutes of blank tape \u2013 for\n  installation at the Nixon Library. Richard Schlesinger will take us inside\n  the vault for a fascinating history lesson. \n\u00a0\nThanks and I hope you\u2019ll join us tonight,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
