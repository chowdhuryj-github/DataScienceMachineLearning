This is a wonderful enhancement to the build-in ls() already and I now have it sourced in my Rprofile.site at startup. \n\nThe only drawback is, 'size' is just the length/dim of an object. For matrices and data frames this is good enough. But for a list, knowing how many elements in there doesn't help much. I need to know the totality of the content in a common unit, eg. byte. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\nHorace\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
