For a short example how to use it, type:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tuneR\")\nlibrary(tuneR)\n?tuneR\n\n\nFor polyphonic sound, I do not know any method that is both sufficiently \nfast (i.e. calculates results for a 1 minute sound in less than a day) \nand accurate.\n\nUwe Ligges\n\n\n\n> I'd say the fundamental harmonics are about 1, 2, 3.5 and 4.5 - but\n> how can I extract these automatically?
