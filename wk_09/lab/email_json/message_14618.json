The initital \nstartup takes almost 10 seconds because R has to load a bunch of \nlibraries as well as a moderately large, previously created workspace.\nI am thinking that it would be so much more eficient to instead have \nR act as a server and fork off a thread for each client query. Is \nthat possible at all ?\n\nThanks!\nMarkus\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
