At the moment, tdb and ldb \nare already in sid. talloc was initially refused (because of some \nlicensing issues), but should enter sid soon.\n\nMetze mentioned there is a bug in the DCE/RPC code when marking the \nconnection dead that should be fixed before TP 5. Are there any other \nissues people think should be fixed for TP 5?\n\nCheers,\n\nJelmer\n\n"}
