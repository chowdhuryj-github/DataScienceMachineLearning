I tried your suggestion, but the same outcome: the command fails without any complaints. BTW, the files didn't have extensions. They are three test files (plain text) containing respectively \"love, live and luve\". The actual command that I tried was perl -i -e \"s/ve/ver/\" *.*\nAny other ideas I might try?\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Bob McConnell \nTo: John Degen ; beginners@perl.org\nSent: Monday, June 18, 2007 2:31:00 PM\nSubject: RE: [Perl 5.8.8 on WinXP] Command line usage\n\nWindows uses file extensions for a variety of reasons, so it expects the\nperiod in file names. In most cases, the file spec \"*\" will only return\nfiles with no extension, such as \"README\". Have you tried \"*.*\" instead?\n\nBob McConnell\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: John Degen [mailto:jeehannes@yahoo.com] \n> Sent: Monday, June 18, 2007 8:26 AM\n> To: beginners@perl.org\n> Subject: [Perl 5.8.8 on WinXP] Command line usage\n> \n> Hello,\n> \n> I'm using Perl 5.8.8 from ActiveState on Windows XP.
