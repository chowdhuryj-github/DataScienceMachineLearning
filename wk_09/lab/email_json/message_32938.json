The wounded were taken to hospitals in nearby Muqdadiyah and the main Shiite district of Sadr City in Baghdad.\n\nHospital officials and victims said it appeared chlorine gas was used in the attack as many of the wounded were having difficulty breathing and had their sight affected. But officials at the provincial police's joint coordination center denied that toxic gas was involved.\n\nOne man had a white cloth across his eyes as he lay in his hospital bed; others were bandaged from head to toe.\n\nAbu Saydah is a mainly Shiite village about 25 miles northeast of the Sunni insurgent stronghold of Baqouba, the capital of the province that has seen a recent spike in violence largely blamed on militants who fled Baghdad ahead of a U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown.\n\n--!>      To stop receiving announcements Deeds4Dollars228 West Lincoln Highway #133 Schererville, Indiana 46375  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
