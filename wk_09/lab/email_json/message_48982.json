What V8 and QuadFX show is that both Intel and AMD are on a path to\noffering true, enthusiast-class, dual-socket platforms. And that's a good\nthing. Perhaps AMD is a little further down the path thanks to a more\ntweaker-friendly motherboard in the QuadFX-compatible Asus L1N64-SLI WS,\nbut until consumers have more motherboards to choose from and perhaps\nquad-core processors from AMD, we can't very well declare that the time\nfor QuadFX has arrived. One motherboard does not a platform make.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/15/1729206\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/25/1511210&tid=118\n    1. http://www.hothardware.com/Articles/Intel_V8_Media_Creation_Platform__Dual_Sockets__Dual_Xeons/\n    2. http://www.hothardware.com/articles/Intel_V8_Media_Creation_Platform__Dual_Sockets__Dual_Xeons/?page=6\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| YouTube to Host Presidential Debate                                |\n|   from the bringing-dancing-cats-to-the-world-of-politics dept.    |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday June 15, @15:23 (Media)                 |\n|   http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/15/1726236     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]skotte writes \"Wired is reporting that July 23 at the Citadel in\nCharleston, South Carolina, Anderson Cooper will host presidential\ndebates in which debaters are asked 20-30 questions [1]culled from a\nspecially designated section of YouTube, where the voting populace can\npost questions directly.
