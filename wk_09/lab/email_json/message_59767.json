Given that unlicensed legal advice is a\ncriminal matter as Sean mentions, there is more to be concerned about than\nhis local laws.\n\n> Does this line of argument mean that when I watch \"Boston Legal\", and \n> decide to follow the advice some of those (fictional) lawyers gave their \n> clients, I can sue the program when it all goes wrong, because the word \n> \"Legal\" in the name gave me a reasonable expectation that they were \n> providing \"legal advice\"?\n\nNo, because nobody in Boston Legal is advising you the watcher to do\nanything.\n\n-- \nSteve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS\nDebian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.\nvorlon@debian.org                                   http://www.debian.org/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
