[(Romans 7:19]\nWhen the product is right, you don't have to be a great marketer.\nGet action. Seize the moment. Man was never intended to become an oyster.\nIt takes a certain courage and a certain greatness to be truly base.\nThe best thing to do with the best things in life is to give them up.\nYou can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jelly beans.\nDon't be against things so much as for things.\nThey can because they think they can.\nPeople who know the least always argue the most.\nBreed is stronger than pasture.\nBudgets are for cutting, that's why you set them.\nI have known a German Prince with more titles than subjects, and a Spanish nobleman with more names than shirts.\nMake every decision as if you owned the whole company.\nBackbone beats wishbone every time.\n\u00a0"}
