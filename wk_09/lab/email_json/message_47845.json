Hash keys are\nstrings.  The stringified version of undef() is the empty string.\nTherefore, accessing it via $hash{\"\"} should work.\n\nHave you tried examining your hash using Data::Dumper, to see what's\n*really* in it?\n\nuse Data::Dumper;\nprint Dumper(\\%hash);\n\nWhat is the output of these two statements?\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
