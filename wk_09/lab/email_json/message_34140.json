The example on that help page shows how\nto use the function to get the correlation between the original\ndistances and cophenetic distances.\n\nHTH\n\nG\n\n-- \n%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%\nGavin Simpson                     [t] +44 (0)20 7679 0522\nECRC                              [f] +44 (0)20 7679 0565\nUCL Department of Geography\nPearson Building                  [e] gavin.simpsonATNOSPAMucl.ac.uk\nGower Street\nLondon, UK                        [w] http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfagls/\nWC1E 6BT                          [w] http://www.freshwaters.org.uk/\n%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
