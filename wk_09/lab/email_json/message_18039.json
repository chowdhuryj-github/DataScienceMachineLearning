You don\u2019t throw somebody overboard just because it\u2019s a deflection. \n      Is that honorable? It\u2019s not honorable to me,\" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley. \n      \u00a0He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and \n      frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president\u2019s inner \n      circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the \n      country\u2019s darkest hour in modern times. You\u2019ll hear and see his feelings \n      on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its \"enhanced \n      interrogation\" methods he says were not torture and saved \n      lives.\u00a0Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn\u2019t torture,\u00a0 \n      these individuals had to have their interrogations \"enhanced,\" Tenet, \n      leans forward to respond, \"Because these are people who will never, ever, \n      ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who\u2019s responsible for the \n      next terrorist attack\u2026.[who] wouldn\u2019t blink an eyelash about killing you, \n      your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.\" \n      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWatch An Excerpt Of Pelley's \n      Report.\n\u00a0\nWith the questions still \n      hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft \n      explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It\u2019s the fact \n      that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to \n      purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a \n      40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally \n      ill.\u00a0Kroft reports that the law isn\u2019t enforced because many states \n      have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom \n      still want their records sealed and not shared with other government \n      agencies. Even the NRA won\u2019t go that far.\u00a0The sad fact is that Cho \n      wasn\u2019t the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased \n      freely, nor will he be likely the last.\n\u00a0\nWatch Kroft's Reporter's \n      Notebook.\n\n\u00a0\nThese stories and some \n      interesting items from Andy Rooney\u2019s mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on \n      60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT. \n      \n\u00a0\nFor an early look at this \n      week\u2019s stories, please click \n      here.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n\u00a0\n"}
