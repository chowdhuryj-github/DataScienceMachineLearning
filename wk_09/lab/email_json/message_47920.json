I want it to work such that if an\nargument is not specified, it is not included in what subset() goes\nlooking for.  So if I were to input:\n\nfunction1(arg2=5, arg3=6)\n\nthen in function1, the subset command will look like\n\n\ttemp.frame <- subset(master.frame, b == 5 & c == 6)\n\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n--\n\njared tobin, student research assistant\ndept. of fisheries and oceans\ntobinjr@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
