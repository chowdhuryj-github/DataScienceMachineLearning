4:28 Or\nif his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall\nbring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for\nhis sin which he hath sinned.\n\n4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and\nslay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.\n\n4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,\nand put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall\npour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.\n\n4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken\naway from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall\nburn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n4:32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a\nfemale without blemish.\n\n4:33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and\nslay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt\noffering.\n\n4:34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\nand shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:\n4:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the\nlamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the\npriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made\nby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his\nsin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a\nwitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,\nthen he shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of\nan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of\nunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall\nbe unclean, and guilty.\n\n5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it\nbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he\nknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.\n\n5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do\ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it\nbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one\nof these.\n\n5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,\nthat he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he\nshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he\nhath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,\nfor a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him\nconcerning his sin.\n\n5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his\ntrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a\nburnt offering.\n\n5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that\nwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his\nneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of\nthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest\nof the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a\nsin offering.\n\n5:10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to\nthe manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin\nwhich he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth\npart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil\nupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a\nsin offering.\n\n5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\nhis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\naccording to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin\noffering.\n\n5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his\nsin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:\nand the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.\n\n5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a\ntrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;\nthen he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without\nblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.\n\n5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the\nholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the\npriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of\nthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are\nforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist\nit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with\nthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance\nwherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against\nthe LORD.\n\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and\ncommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that\nwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken\naway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found\nthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in\nany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall\nbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that\nwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully\ngotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing\nwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he\nshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part\nmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day\nof his trespass offering.\n\n6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram\nwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass\noffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of\nall that he hath done in trespassing therein.\n\n6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his\nsons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt\noffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the\nmorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.\n\n6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen\nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the\nfire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall\nput them beside the altar.\n\n6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and\ncarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\n\n6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not\nbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and\nlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the\nfat of the peace offerings.\n\n6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go\nout.\n\n6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall\noffer it before the LORD, before the altar.\n\n6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat\noffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is\nupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet\nsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.\n\n6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with\nunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\n\n6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for\ntheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the\nsin offering, and as the trespass offering.\n\n6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It\nshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall\nbe holy.\n\n6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering\nof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the\nday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for\na meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof\nat night.\n\n6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou\nshalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt\nthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall\noffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly\nburnt.\n\n6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it\nshall not be eaten.\n\n6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and\nto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place\nwhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed\nbefore the LORD: it is most holy.\n\n6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy\nplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when\nthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt\nwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.\n\n6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and\nif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed\nin water.\n\n6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most\nholy.\n\n6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the\ntabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,\nshall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most\nholy.\n\n7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill\nthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round\nabout upon the altar.\n\n7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the\nfat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat\nthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above\nthe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest\nshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD: it is a trespass offering.\n\n7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten\nin the holy place: it is most holy.\n\n7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one\nlaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have\nit.\n\n7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the\npriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he\nhath offered.\n\n\n\nRead Next Part online | Table of Contents | Discuss this Book\nPlease use our feedback form if there are any problems with your book selection.\n\n\nPrinter Friendly Version |\n      Send this story to a friend |\n      Search on Amazon\u2122\n\n\n\n\nNew Books\n Peace on Earth, Good-Will to Dogs: Eleanor Hallowell Abbott What The Animals Do and Say: Eliza Lee Follen Lost Face: Jack London North of Boston: Robert Frost What Every Woman Knows: J.M.
