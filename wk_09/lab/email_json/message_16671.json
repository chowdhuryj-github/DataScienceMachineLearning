Probability of claim being accepted by the insurance company, say, 0.8\n2. Probability of payout by the insurance company, say, 0.999\n\nCould anyone suggest how one might do this?\n\n\nplatform i386-pc-mingw32\narch     i386\nos       mingw32\nsystem   i386, mingw32\nstatus\nmajor    2\nminor    2.1\nyear     2005\nmonth    12\nday      20\nsvn rev  36812\nlanguage R\n\nThanks,\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
