I want to test my hypothesis by\ncreating a null hypothesis for this population. Since the distribution\nfor the length and the distribution for the intersection size do not\nfollow any known distribution, I think I need to use sample with\nreplacement to simulate those \"parameters\". And use the parameters to\npermutate genes; but I am not very sure if it is alll right.\n\nBTW, is there any general package or I just need \"sample()\" to do\nthat? (just tried to make my question on-topic:)\n\nthanks,\n\n-- \nWeiwei Shi, Ph.D\nResearch Scientist\nGeneGO, Inc.\n\n\"Did you always know?\"\n\"No, I did not.
