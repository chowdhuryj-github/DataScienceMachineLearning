It's only been since I put that script in that I've been \nunable to run either Gnome *OR* Speakup.  Gnome gives me a lovely (NOT) \nprinted error message that I can't even read, and speakup doesn't start \nautomatically or manually.  I tried deleting the script I'd created with \nthe speech-dispatcher and speechd-up commands in it, but I'm still getting \nthe same error.\n\nTerrence\n\nOn Sun, 17 Jun 2007, Hermann wrote:\n\n> I use Ubuntu Feisty and never had any difficaulties to load the\n> speakup_sftsyn module.\n> Hermann\n>\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Speakup mailing list\n> Speakup@braille.uwo.ca\n> http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n>\n>\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
