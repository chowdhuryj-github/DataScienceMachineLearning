Common knowledge defines \"fee\" as\n\"something involving the transfer of money\". If it isn't, then the GPL\nis also non-free, by the very same rationale: the fact that you are\nrequired to produce source when so asked if you do distribute binaries\nfrom source under the GPL means that you are giving up a right (\"the\nright not to distribute any source\") which you might otherwise have,\nwhich could be considered to be a fee.\n\nHey, if we're going to accept leaps of logic, I can do one too.\n\n> Finally, by placing works under licenses with such clauses into\n> non-free, we advise people that they should be examining the license\n> more closely before deciding whether or not they should (or can) use\n> the software.\n\nEveryone who really cares about anything should do that anyway.\n\n-- \nShaw's Principle:\n\tBuild a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will\n\twant to use it.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
