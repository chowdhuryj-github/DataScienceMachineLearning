I thought most licence texts were covered by themselves, being\nshipped as part of the software, but we can't modify the ones shipped\nin debian because we need to accurately pass on the permissions given\nto users.\n\nAFAIK, the few which have different terms for modifying the licence\nrather than the rest of the software (such as the GPL) come with explicit\npermission to modify.\n\n> Historically, this exception has been an unwritten assumption; [...]\n\nHas it?  I've seen a few people write down this assumption, but I've\nusually disagreed with them.\n\nWe don't need this exception.  It would allow another way for people\nto argue for including non-free software in debian ('but it's part of\nthe licence'), just like some use the current non-free logo licences\nto argue for inclusion of their non-free logos.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
