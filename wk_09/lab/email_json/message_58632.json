Here perl doesn't seem to\nunderstand that vplan_all.pl is the script name and 5.6 and 24.0 are\noptions to be passed.\n\nThe exact same text ie. perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 21.0 works fine when i\njust run it from the command line. Confusing! :\\\n\n\nOn 6/29/07, Chas Owens  wrote:\n> On 6/28/07, alex.jamestin+usenet@gmail.com  wrote:\n> snip\n> > I've tried bypassing the shell [ system(xxx,xxx,xx)] but that doesn't\n> > seem to help.\n> snip\n>\n> Hmm, what OS are you using?
