I did try the solution but the result is not\nwhat I expect and I also get the following warning message:\n\n-------------------\n Warning message:\n number of columns of result\n        is not a multiple of vector length (arg 1) in: rbind(1, c(6, 9, 10,\n12, 13, 14, 19, 22, 29, 30, 42, 45, 47,\n -------------------\n\n        The \"list of data frames\" that sapply returns has same number of\ncolumns *but* different number of rows depending on the index of sapply.\n\n        Any idea what might be going wrong?\n\n        Many thanks in advance!.\n\nCheers\n\nAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/29/07, Spielas Bates  wrote:\n>\n> On 4/28/07, Ajit Pawar  wrote:\n> > Greetings,\n> >       This might be something very simple but a nice solution eludes\n> me!!\n> >\n> >        I have a function that I call within sapply that generates data\n> frame\n> > in each call.
