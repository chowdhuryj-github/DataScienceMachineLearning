I really complicated that as it was one of the modules in the \n\"etch\" install.  I heard about supplicant from a local linux user and \nhad downloaded the tarball for 0.5.7. I proceeded to try to install it \nbefore I finally did some checking and discovered that the preloaded \nversion was 0.5.5.  After removing 0.5.7, shutting down and removing my \nnetwork cable, I restarted and the supplicant gui came up asking for my \npassword. Entered and voila.  Connected like a champ. \n    \n\n\nThat seems like a lot of work.  Not to detract from your good results\nbut I think that much effort was not needed.\n\nThe default installation of Etch will install NetworkManager by\ndefault.  Internally NetworkManager already uses wpa_supplicant.\nTherefore I think that if you use NM to connect that you will get\nwpa_supplicant without needing to compile and install it explicitly.\n\nIt \"just worked\" for me when I connected up to a WPA wireless node.  I\nhave always been a low-level type of guy and only recently tried using\nNM to manage these things.  But so far I am quite impressed, like it\nquite a bit, and think the relationship with NM will be a long one.\n\nBob\n\n\n  \n\nHear you Bob.\u00a0 I make the whole thing much toooo difficult by trying to\nconfigure the later version of supplicant while the one in etch was\nalready installed.\u00a0 It was a matter of forging ahead without having\nread enough about etch and knowing that supplicant was already there.\u00a0 \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
