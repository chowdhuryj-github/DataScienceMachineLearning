He doesn't exist!\n\nThat man is idle who can do something better.\n\nOne enemy can do more hurt than ten friends can do good.\n\nThe apparel oft proclaims the man.\n\nBad excuses are worse than none.\n\nPeople whose sensibility is destroyed by music in trains, airports, lifts, cannot concentrate on a Beethoven Quartet.\n\nNever trust the artist. Trust the tale. The proper function of a critic is to save the tale from the artist who created it.\n\nFriendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.\n\nMore persons, on the whole, are humbugged by believing in nothing than by believing in too much.\n\n\n"}
