This is Anthony\n  Mason filling in.\n\u00a0\nCBS News reported today that the patient with\n  extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis is 31-year-old Atlanta lawyer Andrew Haley Speaker. In a strange\n  twist, Speaker\u2019s new father-in-law is a government scientist who has\n  studied tuberculosis \u2013 but he says there\u2019s no connection to his\n  son-in-law\u2019s infection. Kelly Cobiella will have the very latest on\n  this evolving story and will also tell us how the public is reacting. Also, the\n  ease in which the patient crossed the country\u2019s border has exposed\n  cracks in the national security system. Nancy Cordes will look at what this\n  case can illustrate about our country\u2019s preparedness.\n\u00a0\nIn Iraq,\n  the troop surge has reached full strength. But does it have a chance of\n  succeeding by September? David Martin will talk with one lieutenant general\n  who is not optimistic.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, President Bush prepared to clash with\n  other world leaders at the upcoming G-8 summit by announcing his own plan for\n  battling climate change. Who\u2019s backing it and who\u2019s calling it\n  just another smoke screen? Jim Axelrod will have the answers.\n\u00a0\nThe environmental impact of 9/11 is still potentially\n  being felt by tens of thousands of Americans: those who worked on rescue and\n  cleanup after the attacks. Now, as Kelly Wallace will report, a third-wave of\n  Ground Zero-related illnesses is appearing \u2013 in the form of cancer.\n\u00a0\nHate e-mail Spam? You might be seeing a little bit\n  less of it. Robert Alan Soloway, now known as one of the world\u2019s top\n  spammers, was arrested today. Bill Whitaker will tell you how this could\n  affect your in-box.\n\u00a0\nAlso tonight, we\u2019ll take you inside where a\n  sophisticated form of drug dealing takes place \u2013 and it looks just like\n  a doctor\u2019s office. It is one of thousands of \u201cpill mills\u201d across\n  the United States.\n  They are the subject of a CBS News investigation, which reveals the ease with\n  which prescription drugs can be purchased \u2013 without a prescription. Chief\n  investigative correspondent Armen Keteyian will report.\n\u00a0\nFinally, Byron Pitts will give you a look at the\n  library dedicated today to Rev. Billy Graham. I hope you\u2019ll join us for\n  this and more,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Mason\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
