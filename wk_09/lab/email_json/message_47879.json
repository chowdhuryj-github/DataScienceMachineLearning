I\ndid actually do quite a bit of googling and searching of the R help\nbefore posting, and whilst there is quite a lot on each topic\nindividually, I failed to find articles that compare and contrast PCA\nand MDS.  If you know of any, of course I would be happy to read them.\n\nMany thanks\nMick\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Mark Difford\nSent: 14 June 2007 12:49\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] Difference between prcomp and cmdscale\n\n\nMichael,\n\nWhy should that confuse you?  Have you tried reading some of the\nliterature\non these methods?  There's plenty about them on the Net (Wiki's often a\ngoodish place to start)---and even in R, if you're prepared to look ;).\n\nBestR,\nMark.\n\n\nmichael watson (IAH-C) wrote:\n> \n> I'm looking for someone to explain the difference between these\n> procedures.
