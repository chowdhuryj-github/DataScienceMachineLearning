If you are trying to connect to a\ndifferent telnet server, then please provide the name of the server\nand operating system it is running under so we can duplicate your\nenvironment.\n\nfrom Perldoc Net::Telnet\n       Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine\n\n       By default MS-Windows doesn't come with a TELNET server.  However third\n       party TELNET servers are available.  Unfortunately many of these\n       servers falsely claim to be a TELNET server.  This is especially true\n       of the so-called \"Microsoft Telnet Server\" that comes installed with\n       some newer versions MS-Windows.\n\n       When a TELNET server first accepts a connection, it must use the ASCII\n       control characters carriage-return and line-feed to start a new line\n       (see RFC854).  A server like the \"Microsoft Telnet Server\" that doesn't\n       do this, isn't a TELNET server.  These servers send ANSI terminal\n       escape sequences to position to a column on a subsequent line and to\n       even position while writing characters that are adjacent to each other.\n       Worse, when sending output these servers resend previously sent command\n       output in a misguided attempt to display an entire terminal screen.\n\n       Connecting Net::Telnet to one of these false TELNET servers makes your\n       job of parsing command output very difficult.  It's better to replace a\n       false TELNET server with a real TELNET server.  The better TELNET\n       servers for MS-Windows allow you to avoid the ANSI escapes by turning\n       off something some of them call console mode.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
