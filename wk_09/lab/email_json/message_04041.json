Some of us have been there\nand we should be able to help. No need to learn everything the hard way!\n\n\nWhat I didn't know until just this past week is that the DEC Talk\nSpeakup driver is indeed broken. It may not have been your serial port,\nthough the serial port being off in bios by default has been the case on\nmany Thinkpads forever.\n\nAlso, as you've discovered, you want to get your Win in place first\nbefore installing Linux. Win doesn't share with the other kids on your\nhd very well. Got flagged \"needs improvement,\" but can't seem to pass\nout of sand box. May have to be held back a grade or two.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJanina\n\nBeth Hatch writes:\n> \n> \n> Hi everyone,  Because so many of you kindly posted on this list and \n> privately to me concerning getting Linux on my Thinkpad, I figured I \n> would update you all on what has happened in case it saves some of you \n> the trouble and annoyance I have been experiencing lately.
