Among the topics that I would like to cover are linear\nalgebra related to least squares calculations, optimization and\nroot-finding, numerical integration, Monte Carlo methods (possibly\nincluding MCMC), bootstrap, smoothing and nonparametric density\nestimation. Needless to say, the software I will be using is R.\n\n1. Does anybody have a suggestion about a book to follow that covers\n   (most of) the topics above at a reasonable revel for my audience? \n   Are there any on-line publicly-available manuals, lecture notes,\n   instructional documents that may be useful?\n\n2. I do most of my work in R using Emacs and ESS. That means that I\n   keep a file in an emacs window and I submit it to R one line at a\n   time or one region at a time, making corrections and iterating as\n   needed. When I am done, I just save the file with the last,\n   working, correct (hopefully!) version of my code. Is there a way of\n   doing something like that, or in the same spirit, without using\n   Emacs/ESS? What approach would you use to polish and save your code\n   in this case? For my course I will be working in a Windows\n   environment. \n   \n   While I am looking for simple and effective solutions that do not\n   require installing emacs in our computer lab, the answer \"you\n   should teach your students emacs/ess on top of R\" is perfecly\n   acceptable.\n   \n\nThank you for your consideration, and thank you in advance for the\nuseful replies.\n\nHave a good day,\nGiovanni\n\n-- \n\nGiovanni Petris  \nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences\nUniversity of Arkansas - Fayetteville, AR 72701\nPh: (479) 575-6324, 575-8630 (fax)\nhttp://definetti.uark.edu/~gpetris/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
