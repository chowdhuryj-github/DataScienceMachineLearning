Then you could use lrm(y ~ ., \ndata=mydata[continuous]) if it were not for a problem with lrm which \nCharles Thomas Dupont (the Design package maintainer) and I will work \non.  Until then you can write a command to compose a formula, e.g.,\n\nform <- as.formula(paste('y', paste(names(mydata)[continuous], \ncollapse='+'), sep='~'))\nlrm(form, data=mydata)\n\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
