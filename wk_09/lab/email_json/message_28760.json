I\ntried as.numeric in various ways and failed miserably. Currently I use\na function like: for (e in v) { if (e=='1/50') vn<-c(vn,0.02) ...} but\nthat feels bad because it needs to be (humanly) modified everytime a\nnew fraction appears in v.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n-- \nMihai.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
