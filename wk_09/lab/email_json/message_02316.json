New\nYork-based Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., maker of Grand Theft Auto\ngames, had no Wii titles when the player was released and now plans to\nhave three this year, said spokesman Jim Ankner. Activision Inc., based\nin Santa Monica, California, plans to release six Wii games this year,\ngiving the second-largest publisher a total of 11, said spokeswoman\nMaryanne Lataif.\" Though that's great news for Wii gamers, the question\nis: how many of these titles are going to be 'shovelware'?\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/10/1839240\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amWmy6_JG16U&refer=home\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| In EU, Internet Use From Work May Be Protected                     |\n|   from the just-because-they-can-see-you dept.                     |\n|   posted by Zonk on Tuesday April 10, @14:41 (The Courts)          |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/10/1810256          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]athloi wrote with a link to an Ars Technica article on a case\ninvolving [1]the right to privacy on the internet. \"A Welsh university\nemployee has successfully sued the UK government in the EU court of human\nrights over monitoring of her personal internet use from work. According\nto the complaint, the woman's e-mail, phone, Internet, and fax usage were\nall monitored by the Deputy Principal (DP) of the college, who appears to\nhave taken a sharp dislike to her. The woman claimed that her human\nrights were being abused, and pointed specifically to Article 8 of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, which governs private and family\nlife.\" The courts agreed; despite a lack of a notion of 'privacy' in\nEnglish law, the EU convention forced their hand. The ruling doesn't try\nto dissuade employers from monitoring employees, but does encourage them\nto inform employees about surveillance.\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/10/1810256\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://user-advocacy.blogspot.com/\n    1. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070409-european-court-of-human-rights-personal-calls-and-internet-usage-from-work-is-maybe-protected.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Water Found in Exoplanet's Atmosphere                              |\n|   from the so-close dept.                                          |\n|   posted by Zonk on Tuesday April 10, @15:22 (Space)               |\n|   http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/10/1840248      |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nanthemaniac writes \"Astronomers have long suspected that water should\nexist in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.
