Is there some way to get to know the estiamtes at each iteration?

I need to know the estimate values at each iteration.\n>\n>   \nIt might help if you actually _read_ the description of the trace \ncontrol parameter (hint: it is not an on/off switch) in ?optim... And, \nas it says, this is method dependent, so you may have to study the \nsource code.\n\n> Deepankar\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
