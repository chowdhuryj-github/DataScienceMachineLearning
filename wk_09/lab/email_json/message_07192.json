YOu can find the HOW-TO at this \naddress.\n\nhttp://www.maysville-linux-users-group.org/ftopict-193.html#425\n\nHope this helps.\n\n--\n\nI ran Synaptic upgrade from Sarge to Etch without bothering to read the \nupgrade\ndocs first:-(\nSynaptic completed ok, just the usual questions about\nwhat to keep and what to replace. Noted that menu fonts in firefox were \nchanged.\nI rebooted and now have just a command line. GUI tries to start, but fails.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nJohn\nSys.
