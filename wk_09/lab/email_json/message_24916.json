If this is not an error then try changing the loop to\n\nwhile (defined(my $ifile_line = <$IFILE>)) {\n    my $hits = substr($ifile_line, 0, 6);\n    next unless defined $hits;\n    push @id_hits, $hits;\n}\n\nAlso, you should never use a straight string in a regex; it should\naways be quoted.\n\n$line = shift @log until $line =~ /\\Q$prime_id\\E/;\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
