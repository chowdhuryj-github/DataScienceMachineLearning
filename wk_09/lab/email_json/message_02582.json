I can produce the plots fine in R, but so far\nI have had to do the superimposition externally, which makes it tedious to do exploratory work.\nI have looked to see if there is some capability to put a background picture on a plot window,\nbut I have not found anything.\nAdvice, anyone?\n\nCheers\nRobert Biddle\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
