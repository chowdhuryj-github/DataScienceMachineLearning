I tried to RTFM;\ndidn't help.\n\nI want to do a series of regressions over the columns in a data.frame,\nsystematically varying the response variable and the the terms; and not\nnecessarily including all the non-response columns.  In my case, the\ncolumns are time series. I don't know if that makes a difference; it\ndoes mean I have to call lag() to offset non-response terms. I can not\nassume a specific number of columns in the data.frame; might be 3, might\nbe 20. \n\nMy central problem is that the formula given to lm() is different each\ntime.  For example, say a data.frame had columns with the following\nheadings:  height, weight, BP (blood pressure), and Cals (calorie intake\nper time frame).  In that case, I'd need something like the following:\n\n\tlm(height ~ weight + BP + Cals)\n\tlm(height ~ weight + BP)\n\tlm(height ~ weight + Cals)\n\tlm(height ~ BP + Cals)\n\tlm(weight ~ height + BP)\n\tlm(weight ~ height + Cals)\n\tetc.\n\nIn general, I'll have to read the header to get the argument labels.\n\nDo I have to write several functions, each taking a different number of\narguments?  I'd like to construct a string or list representing the\nvarialbes in the formula and apply lm(), so to say  [I'm mainly a Lisp\nprogrammer where that part would be very simple. Anyone have a Lisp API\nfor R? :-}]\n\nThanks,\nchris\n\nChris Elsaesser, PhD        \nPrincipal Scientist, Machine Learning\nSPADAC Inc.\n7921 Jones Branch Dr. Suite 600  \nMcLean, VA 22102  \n\n703.371.7301 (m)\n703.637.9421 (o)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
