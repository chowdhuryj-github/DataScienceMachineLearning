I thought it wasn't necessary (lexpad holds\n   all the info we'd need). The segfault I got must have been a symptom\n   from another GC bug.\n\nCan I mark this \"resolved\", then?\n\n   Also, what about the other GC bug?  Is it fixed?  Can you reproduce\nit?  GC bugs in the core of the interpreter are scary . . .\n\n   Thanks for checking my patch.\n\nNo problem; thanks for sending it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob\n\n"}
