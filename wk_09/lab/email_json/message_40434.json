It is designed to replace the\npurchasing of CDs.  Buying CDs is inefficent.  With\ncurrent peer-to-peer technology their is no cost for\ndistribution.  The real value is in the process of\ncreation.  \n\nSo pay artists for creation.  Funding the creation process\nhas many benefits.  It is more efficent, resulting in\nhigher profits for artists and lower costs for consumers,\nit removes the threat of piracy as a revenue drain on\nartists, it allows fans to take part in the creation\nprocess.  \n\n\n--------------------------------------\nEasy + Joy + Powerful = Yahoo!
