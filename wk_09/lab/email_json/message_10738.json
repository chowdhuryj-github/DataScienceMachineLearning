While I would have no problem with this, there is clearly scope \nfor confusion and errors on the part of my colleague, who is more used to \n'one click' (wince!) loading and saving of .SAV files.\n\nOkay, I could opine that someone who cannot be trusted to run SPSS syntax \nfiles shouldn't be using SPSS, but that sort of snobbery aside, is anyone \naware of a wrapper that runs in R that to produce the standard .SAV files?\n\n\nDr Stuart J Leask DM MRCPsych MA BChir\nSenior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant in Clinical Psychiatry\nUniversity Dept of Psychiatry, Duncan Macmillan House\nPorchester Road.
