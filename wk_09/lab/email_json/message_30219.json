To install Linux in place of your \ncurrent MS Windows operating system you would need to download one of the ISO \nimages, then burn it to an optical disk (CD-R or DVD-R) to enable you to \ninstall it. If you would rather just test-drive Linux before choosing to \ninstall it please let me know - I will burn a live-cd for you and then send \nit to you.\n\nPlease let me know if I can assist you in any way.\n\nIt was a pleasure to meet you over the phone.\n\nCheers,\nJohn T.\nHome: (512) 288-1721\n\n"}
