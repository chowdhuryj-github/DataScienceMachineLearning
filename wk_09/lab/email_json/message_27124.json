We're lucky enough to\nlive in a city where busses, trains and cabs are plentiful. \nLiving just about anywhere else, we'd have to buy a \nstupid car. We also have no children though I have a \nson from a previous marriage who is married and has \none child. We do try to recycle, especially newspapers.\nI reuse plastic grocery bags as garbage pail liners.\nWe have Central Air Conditioning but try to use fans in\nthe windows on all but the hottest days. We live in an\napartment, not a house (again by choice). \n\nI figure we're doing our bit. \n\nVickie\n\n\n-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nMusic's the way, the only way I know...\n\nHappy Rhodes MySpace page: http://www.myspace.com/happyrhodes\nHappy Rhodes song samples: http://wretchawry.com/happy/samples\nHappy Rhodes on YouTube: http://wretchawry.com/happy/rarities/videolist.html\nHappy Rhodes Subtitled videos: http://wretchawry.com/happy/rarities/googlevideo.html\n\nSuspended In Gaffa: http://suspended-in-gaffa.com\nStreaming audio: http://www.myspace.com/gaffashow\n\n-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n"}
