I've had to on several\noccassions work to ensure that a 32bit libnss_winbindd\ncould communicate with a 64bit winbindd.  This is a\nbig pain.\n\n> Should I just change those?

The pstring/fstring change is just to\nsupport a list of group names rather than a single one.\nShould be a marshalled string in reality but until we nove\nto IDL, static sized structures are the rule of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGX0XVIR7qMdg1EfYRAhnuAJ0b56fTFgB0DZuHWL6FuaBiPfHe3QCglx0w\ngHSU5ae1eqgPLvvZh6wSqcw=\n=4vrM\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
