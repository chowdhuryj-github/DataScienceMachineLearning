We know that the problem with the\nspelling is.  First of allthat it is not the kernel.  Forget about\nrecompiling kernels.  We should not have to do this when it is not\nnecessary.  Forget about changes to priorities of processes, that's\nbunk.  \n\nLet's look at this a little.  It seems to depend on what machine the\nthing runs on as to whether or not re-nicing the speechd-up process to\nnegative 20 or infinity, who really knows, if it will work.  Here it\nis.  \n\nIf the speech-dispatcher and speechd-up people are lerking on this\nlist, or if they have access at all to any of this, here's what you\nneed to do.  \n\nTest your speechd-up with the preempt on in the kernel like it is\nsupposed to be.  If the thing spells instead of reads right, fix the\nbuffering or the way you read from /dev/sftsynth.  \n\nI might be able to fix it but I don't have the time nor the desire.  I\nhave several development paprojects I need to get moving on and I need\nto get my web site up, now that I have this new hardwere.  I am not\ngoing to touch it.  Whoever wrote speechd-up and/or speech-dispatcher,\nshould be the ones to fix the problem.  \n\nIf you are reading this, please fix the buffering or whatever it might\nbe in the way speech-dispatcher and/or speechd-up reads from\n/dev/sftsynth, and it should be fixed.  \n\n\n\nYours most sincerely.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nI use grml (http://grml.org/)\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
