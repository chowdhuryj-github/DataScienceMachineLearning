Except in really special cases,\nsoft references are a terrible idea, and this snippet is a perfect\nexample of a case when you should NOT use them.\n\nWhy not\n\nfor ( 1 .. 100 ) {\n push @buttons, $mw->Button->pack;\n}\n\nNow you have a nice list of 100 buttons in @buttons\n\n-- \n\tLawrence Statton - lawrenabae@abaluon.abaom s/aba/c/g\nComputer  software  consists of  only  two  components: ones  and\nzeros, in roughly equal proportions.
