Unfortunately, I had a look on the\nexample before posting but not much of a help... I did some further\ntests and in order to have the same results I must run mahalanobis\nwith the predictors only dataset, ie.\nmahalanobis(predictors, colMeans(predictors), cov(predictors)).\n\nNow, on a first glance it seems to me a bit strange that the influence\nof these points on a regression are measured without taking into\naccount the response variable (provided that the other stat software\ncalculates the mahalanobis distances correctly).... but I guess this\nis something that I have to resolve by doing some studying on my own\non the mahalanobis distance...\n\nthanks again.\n\n>\n> now cross check with other software\n>\n> best\n>\n> Anup\n>\n>\n>  ________________________________\n> No need to miss a message.
