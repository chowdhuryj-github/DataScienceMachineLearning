The goal of\nthe site is provide an alternative means for musicians,\nprogrammers, movie producers, and authors to fund,\npublicize, and distribute their works.  I would like to\nget feedback on the concept and the site itself.\n\n \n\n\u2013 The Philosophy \u2013\n\nHistorically publishing companies provided many useful\nservices for creative producers.  They provided equipment\nand facilities, funded artists, developed worldwide\ndistribution channels, and publicized and advertised on\nartists\n\u001b$B!G\u001b(B behalf.  But as time went on the industry became\nbloated and corrupt.  Artists have been forced into\nrestrictive contracts, lost control of the copyrights, and\ngiven small cuts of the revenue.  Consumers have been\nforced to pay exorbitant prices and suffer DRM and nasty\nlawsuits.  \n\n \n\nBut the industry has undergone massive change.  In the\nInternet age, the functions of the media industry are\nbeing taken over by consumers and artists themselves.  The\nprice of equipment has dropped so that individuals can now\ncreate professional quality productions independently. \nFans now use blogs, messengers, and e-mail to spread the\nword about what they like.  There is no longer a need to\nship CDs, books, or DVDs as File sharing services offers a\ncostless distribution method.  \n\n \n\nThe only missing piece now is \u001b$B!H\u001b(Bfunding\u001b$B!I\u001b(B.  While file\nsharing is great, the result of unchecked piracy will\nleave artists with no way to make money and therefore no\nincentive to produce new media.  It is time for the\nfunding model to evolve.  Historically, bundled into the\ncost of each CD or book is the cost of production and\ndistribution.  But now with the internet distribution is\nnearly costless.  Let\n\u001b$B!G\u001b(Bs move the payment forward to the point of creation.  \nRecording companies pay artists upfront to create\nsomething new and then charge the consumers per copy; let\n\u001b$B!G\u001b(Bs have fans pay the artists directly and give them the\nfreedom to use and share.  They will use this freedom to\ndistribute and promote, providing a valuable service to\nartists.  The end result would be lower total costs, more\nfreedom and control for artists and consumers, and new\ncommunities with strong ties between artists and fans.\n\n \n\n\u2013 The Site \u2013\n\nWith actualizing this vision in mind, I created\nwww.strayform.com.  It works like a social network for\nartist and fans with specialized features to promote,\nfund, and distribute new media.  A library of CC licensed\nmedia leads to you to discover new artists.  Becoming fans\nof these artists and selecting media as one of your\nfavorites allows us to rank and provide recommendations,\nwhile giving you specialized privileges and notifications.\n People with similar interests surfing your pages use\nthese connections and find new favorites and artists as\nwell.  These massive connectivity provides a network that\nfunnels interest into Proposals.  Proposals are artists\n\u001b$B!G\u001b(B offers to create new CC licensed media funded by fans. \nThe more proposals that are completed the large the\nlibrary grows.  For artists, the more of their media\ncirculating the more fans they gather.  The more fans an\nartist has the more money he can make on each successive\nproposal, the greater the incentive to create new works. \nAs the ecosystem grows we have a new system for funding,\npromotion, and distribution built by fans and artists.  \n\n \n\nWe are a very small company, but have created an expansive\nsystem based on this concept.  We have just launched and\nwould like feedback on how to improve our system and would\nlike to get the word out about Strayform.  So please try\nour site out and give me your feedback, I am Member \n\u001b$B!H\u001b(BStray Brandt.\u001b$B!I\u001b(B  We are new and small so I am sure we\nhave a lot of room for improvement, but please join us and\nhelp us reach this vision.\n\n \n\n \n\nBrandt Cannici\nFounder\nwww.strayform.com\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nEasy + Joy + Powerful = Yahoo!
