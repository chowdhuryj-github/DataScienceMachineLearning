Just came in this evening.  Hooked that puppy up first thing,\nthen tried playing with Slackware.  Only came back to Windows to ask wtf \nabout where speakup.i went, and on another mailing list on which fs was \nbetter, EXT3 or reiserfs.  I think I'll stick with the EXT3 file system \nfor now, and go over the Slackware docs again.  Will do the install \ntomorrow, when I'm fresh and re-indocumentrinated.   Thanks for \nall the help folks,\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
