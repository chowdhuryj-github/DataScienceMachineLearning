It may not be elegant, but\nit is practical... and Perl has weighed in on that side of the dilemma\nbefore.  I think part of Perl 4's success was the \"one stop shopping\"\navailability of numerous useful functions that would otherwise have\nrequired linking in a library, e.g. dbmopen, crypt, shmget, gethostbyaddr,\nmath functions, etc.  I think the synergistic effect of the combination of\nall these functions being so readily available helped Perl take off. \nPlease continue the tradition of tending to err on the side of \"practical\"\nover \"elegant\".  It may not seem rational that avoiding the need to type\n\"cpan Foo::Bar\" makes a huge difference, but I believe it does, for\ncertain modules.\n\n-- \nPeter Scott\nhttp://www.perlmedic.com/\nhttp://www.perldebugged.com/\n\n"}
