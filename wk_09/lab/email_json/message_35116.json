Tuesday, February 27.\u00a0  The 9% overnight melt-down shook every market across the planet over the  next 12 hours.\nHad  you followed my instructions, issued via a special email Flash Alert on  Wednesday morning, you would have today, 10 weeks later\u2026\n\u2026gains  of 48% in Aluminum Corp. of China\n\u2026gains  of 30% in Apple\n\u2026gains  of 29% in both China Petroleum and Suntech Power\n\u2026gains  of 27% in China Life\n\u2026gains  of 24% in The9 Limited\n\u2026gains  of 22% in both Comtech and CTrip\nThat\u2019s  2- 3 Years Of Profit\u2014\nIn  10 Weeks!\n\u00a0The February Surprise may never be satisfactorily  explained, but the subsequent April Dash, in which the Shanghai market roared  back 45% is more important to understand:\n\nA  vast economy growing at over 11% pulls stocks along with it as surely as  day follows night.\u00a0 It's just inevitable.\n\nHi\u2014Robert Hsu here  and I am sending you this urgent Flash Alert today because, for the THIRD TIME inside a few months, you  are about to be totally BLINDSIDED by China.\nFIRST by the  shocking Shanghai melt down in February\u2026\nSECOND by the  surprising melt UP this spring by China stocks\u2026\nAND NOW comes The  June Surprise.\nAre  You Ready\nThis  Time?\n\u00a0Please listen to me  carefully.\u00a0 The gains of 22% - 48%  my subscribers made this spring were made possible because we were ready.\nWe  knew that, on Wednesday morning, February 28, we had to buy and buy with both  hands.\u00a0 We scooped up profits in  that one move that gave us 2 or 3 years\u2019 worth of profits in just 10 weeks.\nThis  week I have told my subscribers: GET READY FOR THE JUNE SURPRISE.\u00a0 It\u2019s a doozy, my friend, and when I  tell you about it, you will have a stark  and urgent choice.\nIGNORE  ME AGAIN\u2014OR PREPARE TO ACT.\nIn  this short message I will do everything in my power to convince you that you must prepare.\u00a0  Please\u2014just hear me out.\u00a0  Then decide for yourself.\nWhat  No One Is\nTelling  You\n\u00a0The world is changing faster than most of us can  even grasp, my friend. \nJust  ask the CEOs of Alcoa and Alcan.\u00a0  The pending merger of these archrivals in a $30 billion deal is happening  because China\u2019s headlong economic growth will DOUBLE the demand for aluminum in  the next few years.\u00a0 If Alcoa and Alcan don\u2019t put aside  their differences, they\u2019ll simply vanish\u2014swallowed whole by a Russian or  Chinese rival.\nEven  if they do merge, they could still be  taken over.\nThis  was unthinkable, even a few years ago.\u00a0  But from Chrysler to Kodak, from The Wall Street Journal to Winnebego,  from Alcoa to IBM, you can see for yourself the ground splitting, you can hear  the roar, you can feel the icons rattling and crashing\u2026as a massive China  economy, bulging and growing at an 11% rate, pulls the world as we know it into  a new shape.\nThe  profits you make from this Chinaquake over the next few years will far exceed  all the money you\u2019ve made in a lifetime of work and investing.\n\nPROOF: While Alcoa and Alcan were figuring out how to  mate, Aluminum Corp of China soared 48% for my subscribers.\u00a0 That\u2019s 5 years\u2019 of profit\u2014in just 10  weeks!\n\nWhich brings us to  the coming JUNE SURPRISE.\nIt\u2019s Inevitable\u2014\nAnd Totally Unforeseen\nI laughed so hard  at breakfast, my family looked worried.\nOn February 28,  after the 9% drop in the Shanghai Index, guru after guru appeared on my morning  TV, trying to tell me that the China market was\u2014and I quote\u2014due for a breather.\u00a0 Needed some steam taken out.\u00a0 \nLike this was a  horse\u2014or a boiler.\u00a0 \nI dashed my Flash  Alert to my subscribers in the next few minutes.\nListen to me on  this, please:\n\nAN ECONOMY\u2014ESPECIALLY ONE AS BIG AS CHINA\u2019S\u2014GROWING AT  11% A YEAR\u2014MAKES ALL VALUATION ARGUMENTS WORTHLESS AS SOON AS THEY ARE MADE!\n\nSure,  an economy chugging along, as the U.S.  economy is, at a steady 3%, will be accompanied by a market that runs ahead,  stops, drops behind, runs around in circles\u2014and offers value investors  reasonable opportunities to target nice opportunities.\nBut  an economy pounding ahead at 11% or more  (I suspect more, by the way) makes this mornings\u2019 valuation of a company out  of date by tonight!\nTake  our Aluminum Corp example.\u00a0 It  doesn\u2019t even POSSESS a relevant valuation metric.\u00a0 It\u2019s a well-run company in a market that\u2019s doubling, in an  economy that will twice today\u2019s size in  2015.\u00a0 \nSo  the 48% we made in the last 10 weeks was neither a lot\u2026nor a little\u2026 because  there are simply no guideposts for this.\nAnd while Wall  Street gurus confidently look forward to a traditional market slowdown,  beginning in June, guess what will happen to China stocks.\n\nTHEY\u2019LL POUND AHEAD\u2014leaving investors behind\u2026again!\n\nRight  now in China, a billion people are just arriving back at work after a long  holiday.\u00a0 The Olympics are only a  year away.\u00a0 Beijing is flooding the  system with cash.\nAnd  well-run companies like China Life, CTrip, Mindray Medical, Suntech Power and  Focus Media will  continue to soar 5%, 10%, 15% a day.\nYes, a day.\nIn  June, when Wall Streeters are day-dreaming about how to beat the rush to Long  Island beaches this summer\u2026\n\u2026stock  after stock on today\u2019s Buy List will be crashing through 52-week highs.\nI  Want You To Be\nReady  For This\n\u00a0Let Wall Street slumber.\u00a0 You and I need to get busy making money.\nPositions  carefully built in the next 10-15 days, following my explicit instructions, can  be expected to rise as much as 25% by the July 4 holiday.\nPositions  established now in the 5 top Buys named in today\u2019s issue of China Strategy could be 50%, maybe 70% higher by Labor Day\u2026and  could be doubles for you by year end.\nThis  list of stocks for immediate accumulation is available instantly here.\nYou  Know This\n\u00a0You already know this: The last time there was an  economy growing at this rate, men like Morgan, Carnegie and Rockefeller  bestrode the land.\u00a0 People like you  and me could only grab scraps of the immense wealth being created in those days.\nIt\u2019s  different this time. Draw up a chair and dig in.\nIf  you\u2019re not quite sure how, try China Strategy.\u00a0 Our China stocks are  doubling and the reason is: we get out there and kick over some rocks.\nMe and my team of  analysts, my hand-picked team of mini-Peter Lynches, if you like, looking at  what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, in inland cities and outlying suburbs all over  China.\u00a0 Asking questions\u2014and  discarding the lies, which make up an astoundingly high volume of the answers.\nNo one else does  this.\u00a0 I know because I  checked.\u00a0 \nDon\u2019t  miss The June Surprise.\u00a0 The China  economy is NOT going on summer break!\u00a0  I expect positions established now in our 5 top China stocks could be  25% higher by July 4th, 50% higher by Labor Day\u2014and doublers by year  end.\nGet in now.\n\n        Robert Hsu, Editor\nChina Strategy\nProfiting from The China Miracle\nP.S. DON\u2019T GET BLINDSIDED  AGAIN.\u00a0 Establish your positions  now and you won\u2019t miss out again on the huge gains my China Strategy subscribers are getting.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ignore me this time.\u00a0 Click here. \n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nMANAGE YOUR INVESTORPLACE ACCOUNT:\nWe hope this timely investing advice is valuable to you.\n        Please tell us if your email has changed by visiting here:\nhttp://investorplace.com/ipi/e/\nIf you would rather not receive actionable investing advice from InvestorPlace advisors, you can let us know by visiting http://www.investorplace.com/u/?p=8BX249-1&e=IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA\nWe will honor your request within 7-10 days.\nACP Phillips Investment Resources, LLC,\n        2420A Gehman Lane\n        Lancaster, PA 17602\nCopyright (c) 2007 ACP Phillips Investment Resources, LLC.\n        All rights reserved.\n05/23/2007 6:26PM\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Thank you for subscribing to InvestorPlace.com.
