If you have to use lattice, then the following may help you.  It's\nclose, but not quite what you want; you almost certainly need to write a\ncustom panel function.  Hopefully Deepayan will step in (as he usually does)\nto help you.\n\n1) Look at ?strip.default, as well as ?xyplot (search for \"strip\",\n\"strip.left\")\n\n2) Example:\n\nxyplot(y ~ x | interaction(g1,g2, drop=TRUE), groups=g3, data=DF,\nstrip.left=strip.custom(factor.levels=c(\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\")),\nstrip=strip.custom(factor.levels=rep(c(\"g1=a\",\"g1=b\"),2)))\n\nHope that helps,\n\nRegards,\nMark.\n\n\nPablo Lewinger wrote:\n> \n> I've searched the archives and read the xyplot help but can't figure \n> out the 2 lattice questions below?\n> \n> Consider:\n> \n> library(lattice)\n> DF <- data.frame(x=rnorm(20), y=rnorm(20), g1=rep(letters[1:2], 10),\n>                   g2=rep(LETTERS[1:2], each=10), \n> g3=rep(rep(letters[3:4],each=5),2))\n> \n> xyplot(y ~ x | g1 + g2, groups=g3, data=DF)\n> \n> 1) Is there a way to get one strip per row and column of panels as \n> below instead of the default?\n> \n> \n>         _|__a__|__b__|\n>          |\n>        B\n>          |\n>         --\n>          |\n>        A\n>          |\n> \n> 2) How do I control the text of the strips so that for instance \n> instead of \"a\" and \"b\" it reads\"g1=alpha\", \"g1=beta\" where \"alpha\" \n> and \"beta\" stand for the corresponding greek symbols?
