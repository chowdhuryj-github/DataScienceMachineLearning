I just realized that introducing a postfix:<.>\noperator would complicate matters in unexpected ways by forcing\ninfix:<.> to require disambiguating whitespace, as per S02.  This\nwould be Very Bad in several ways, e.g., an infixed dot is given as\nthe appropriate way to separate a postfix operator from the term in\nfront of it when whitespace is forbidden.  Or the fact that 'foo.bar'\nwould no longer parse as expected.  :sigh:\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
