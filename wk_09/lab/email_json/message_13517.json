I use mutt and fetchmail (which I set up using advises from this list :)) to retrieve my email from gmail. It works fine and I have several filters on procmail to order my mail in several folders. \nIf I use procmail while retrieving my mail, filtering works fine. But I also have a mailbox which has already several hundred messages I want to sort using the filters from procmail.Here is the problem: I did'nt find a way to launch procmail on an existing filled mailbox when not retriving the mail at the same time.\nI looked into options and man pages, but this option does not seem to exist.In clear, I want be able to make something like:procmail .procmail/debian-list.rc Mail/inboxwhere debian-list;rc is the filter rule and inbox the inbox on which to apply the filter.\nIs that even possible using procmail? If yes, what options do I have to use?Thanks a lotRegardsAlexandre\n"}
