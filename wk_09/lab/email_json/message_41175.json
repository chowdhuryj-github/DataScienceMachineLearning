Any ideas?\n\nKai,\nkeep in mind not all machines in the build farm behaves perfectly.\nSometimes they just fail for reasons not related to your change.\n\nJust examine the logs (and build history in that host) and if you are\nreasonably sure it is not related to a change you made, just wait some\ntime (a day or so) and check later to see if anything changed.\n\nAlso some hosts are so slow that they may take several svn revisions\nbetween tests, so make sure the fault is not due to others code.\n\nSimo.\n\n-- \nSimo Sorce\nSamba Team GPL Compliance Officer\nemail: idra@samba.org\nhttp://samba.org\n\n"}
