I'm hoping that I could get some advice.\n\nAll of my users will have access to a database server.  I am going to limit their access to certain databases--a sizeable warehouse in a SAN, and then smaller storage that they can use for temp files and personal tables.  I want to present these to the user using a tktree widget, rather like you might see in Enterprise Guide, with the top level of each tree being a specific database and branches being tables.\n\nCan I get some advice on a good way to accomplish this?\n\nRight now I can create and connect to a DSN that does not specify a database.  I suppose that upon connection I could use sqlQuery to get the names of databases and their tables, then use the result to populate the tree.  However, once a table has been selected, would I need to create a new connection (since the existing connection does not specify a database) or could I use the existing one for everything and just specify database and table in my queries?\n\nAlso, any additional advice on would be appreciated if anyone has any.\n\nThanks,\n\nPete\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
