The information is in help(\"Memory-limits\").\n\nWe are aware that at some point we will need to raise this limit and have \ndiscussed ways to do so.  But it is not going to be an issue for a while: \nworking with 16Gb objects needs the sort of amount of memory that will not \nbecome common for anouther 5 years or so.\n\nOn Fri, 1 Jun 2007, Marc Schwartz wrote:\n\n> Harold,\n>\n> Actually there is a maximum size, even if one had sufficient memory.\n>\n> Since a matrix is a vector with a dim attribute, and these objects are\n> indexed using integers, the maximum sized vector one 'could' create is:\n>\n>> .Machine$integer.max\n> [1] 2147483647\n>\n> which is:\n>\n>> 2^31 - 1\n> [1] 2147483647\n>\n> and that does not differ on 64 bit systems.\n>\n> HTH,\n>\n> Marc Schwartz\n>\n>\n> On Fri, 2007-06-01 at 17:36 -0400, Doran, Harold wrote:\n>> There is no maximum size.
