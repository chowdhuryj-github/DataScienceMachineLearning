Tsay\n\nas one other message says, it depends a lot on your ideas what you want \nto do with R. And, I'd like to add, how familiar you are with statistics.\nOne book I am missing in your list is Venables / Ripley: Modern Applied \nStatistics with S. I can highly recommend it.\nIf you are going to buy yourself only one book, then I would say: buy \nVenables/Ripley\n\nBest,\nRoland\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
