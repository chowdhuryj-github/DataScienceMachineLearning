One cabinet was labeled \"A to N,\" and the second was \n      labeled \"O to Z.\" \n      \nTONIGHT ON THE CBS \n      EVENING NEWSHere is an early preview of what we \n      are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing \n      Editor, Katie Couric... Hi everyone, Tonight, \n      we'll be broadcasting from Philadelphia, home of the Independence Hall, \n      the Liberty Bell and a vibrant population that is the sixth-largest in the \n      United States. Philly is also known as the city where American democracy \n      was born - and tonight we'll have a cultural and historical view of a city \n      that has contributed so much to our country's history. This city, \n      which was home to the country's first hospital - founded by Benjamin \n      Franklin in 1751 - now is having a health-care crunch that's particularly \n      acute for pregnant women and the care they're getting when it counts. \n      I'll take a closer look at this story for you. Before that, \n      the news of the day. To start out our broadcast, David Martin will \n      have an exclusive report on Pentagon planning and the war in Iraq. \n      Meanwhile, are Democrats blinking first on the prospect of a withdrawal \n      deadline? Sharyl Attkisson will fill you in. A different \n      kind of debate is heating up on the streets - and on the Web. An \n      anti-informant \"stop snitching\" campaign now has a high-tech edge. And \n      this is infuriating federal prosecutors, Bob Orr will explain. \n      As hurricane season approaches, National Weather Service \n      forecasters warn that they expect between 13 and 17 tropical storms this \n      year, with at least seven of them becoming hurricanes. Is the Gulf Coast \n      ready? Hari Sreenivasan will examine New Orleans' levee system and \n      whether it is equipped to survive a major storm. We've been \n      following the story of the two whales stranded 60 miles up the Sacramento \n      River in California. Sandra Hughes will tell you about the \n      obstacles still in their way en route to their ocean home - and the hope \n      spectators have for their safe return. Finally, we'll come back to \n      Philadelphia, where we will settle down with a cheese steak and channel \n      some memories from decades past in the City of Brotherly Love. \n      I hope you'll join us.
