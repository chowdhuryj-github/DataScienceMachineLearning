To the best of my knowledge, the\nFSF is like most of the free software community in generally\ndiscouraging the creation such derivative licenses.  In any case, the\ncopyright owner for this software really should talk to the FSF about\ngetting permission to use the text of the GPL in a \"GPL+limitations\"\ntype of license.\n\nMichael Poole\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
