From my point\nof view one of the biggest strengths of Parrot is that it's a target for \nmany (and why not all?)\ndynamic languages and as I know there's no other VM like it. Well... since \nnow.\n\nCheck this article: http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=404\nMicrosoft announces a dynamic layer for CLR, so they will be able to\nsupport dynamic languages on their VM.\nAnd JVM 1.6 already has this, plus it's opensource and has\nsupport for the mainstream platforms.\n\nSo, is one of parrot's biggest strengths gone? Are we too late?\nWhy would the developers use Parrot instead of JVM/CLR/Mono? \n\n\n\n"}
