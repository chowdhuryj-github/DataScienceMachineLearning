Never mind that Mashelkar himself has said that his report has nothing to do with sec 3(d) of Indian patent law: http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/commons-law/2007-February/002358.html\n>>>[Mashelkar] says that he's \"in total agreement with Section 3(d). The benchmarks that we set depends entirely on us. It is for any individual country to decide the threshold limits and it is through these thresholds that the governments can exercise control.\"<<<\n\nThe upside - for all those \"critics\" out there, with enemies like this, who needs friends?\n--\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
