I did what I thought was right for our country\" Tony Blair said today. \n\n\nTonight, in an extended programme, Jeremy will be joined by guests including Alastair Campbell, Michael Howard, Charles Kennedy and David Hare for the definitive assessment of the Prime Minister's time in office.\n\n\nWith the help of Michael Crick in London, David Grossman in Sedgefield, and retrospectives by Martha Kearney - we'll assess what impact the Blair decade has made on Britain, and how it changed the face of politics. Will the Iraq war dominate his legacy, or will history judge that his reforms to public services have irreversibly changed this country?\n\n\nDo join Jeremy for what's certain to be a fascinating show.\n\n\nYou can watch Martha's films right now.
