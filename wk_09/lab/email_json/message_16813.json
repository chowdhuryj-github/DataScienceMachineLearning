My main concern is the home directory mapping.  Currently the\nshell mapping isn't an issue, but it seems reasonable to address this at\nthe same time.\n\nThe site, is primarily a MS windows site with over 10,000 users.  There\nare six Windows 2003 Servers as the domain controllers. There are many\nhundreds of OUs which represent member offices, committees, admins and\nother SIGs.\n\nIf the situation were simple, the default group might have been\npossible.  However, admins being admins, they frequently somehow create\naccounts where the default group is domain users rather than the\nappropriate group. There are cases where the default department group\nisn't possible for a user such as admins or committee people.\n\nThe mapping would address our issues.  For example, a getent passwd user\nwould have the mapped home directory in it.\n\nThanks,\nWayne\n\n"}
