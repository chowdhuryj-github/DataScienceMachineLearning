What are people's views on the above\nproposed additions?\n\nAlso, Jerry mentioned sharing of queries on RT.  How does one go about\nthis?  I have my own searches for [TODO], [CAGE], [BUG], and [PATCH]\nand I don't know if they are of any help to others, but they might be.\n How do I use other people's other queries?\n\nPaul\n\n"}
