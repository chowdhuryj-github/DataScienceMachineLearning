You can inspect them in Explorer via tools|folder options|File types, by finding the file type and looking at the advanced options. \n\nI would suspect that installing acrobat and the reader in different order on different machines will have changed the default file open action. You can override the defaults by specifying your own.\n\nbut it will have essentially nothing to do with R... you should see the same behaviour in explorer.\n\n\n\n\n>>> \"Richard M. Heiberger\"  12/05/2007 00:37:13 >>>\nI have Windows XP machines with different software configurations.\nMy laptop has Adobe Reader 8 and Adobe Acrobat 6.\nMy desktop has Adobe Reader 8 and does not have Adobe Acrobat.\n\nOn both machines, PDF extensions are registered to Adobe Reader 8.0,\nand double-clicking a pdf file in Windows Explorer opens Adobe Reader\n8.0.\n\nIn R-2.5.0, with all Adobe windows closed, the command\n  shell.exec('c:/Program Files/R/R-2.5.0/doc/manual/R-admin.pdf')\nopens an Adobe window.\nOn the laptop, it opens Adobe Acrobat 6.0.\nOn the desktop, it opens Adobe Reader 8.0.\n\nWhen an Adobe window is aleady open, shell.exec() uses the already\nopen Adobe window.\n\nNeither machine has any Adobe directories in the shell(\"PATH\").\n\nI am puzzled by shell.exec() opening \"Adobe Acrobat\" when the file\nextension is registered to \"Acrobat Reader\".  The documentation in\n?shell.exec says \"Opens the specified file or URL using the\napplication specified in the Windows file associations.\"\n\n\nthanks\nRich\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html \nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n*******************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential.
