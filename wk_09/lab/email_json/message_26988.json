Regenoud is quite apt to solve that kind of problems, but\nthe precision of the optimal values for the parameters is sometimes\nfar from what I need. Optim seems to be more precise, but it can only\naccept box-constrained optimization problems. I read in the list\narchives that optim can also be used with nonlinear constrains through\npenalizations. However, I am not familiar with the technique of\npenalizations. Could someone please indicate to me a site or a book to\nlearn about that penalization technique?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
