We're such a small market that it's \nnecessary to charge so much to recoup the expense of making the stuff. \nIt's relativity.  For every action, there's an equal and opposite \nreaction, and someone is gonna starve.  That's why I feel like Linux is \nso special.  People freely offer what we now have, without really \ndepriving little Cindy of what's on her dinner plate.  Money doesn't \neven enter the picture.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
