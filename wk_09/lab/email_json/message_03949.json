So it at best ends up saving it in some  \ntemporary location, and it has to be downloaded again next time R is  \nrestarted.\n\nAs a result, I have always downloaded the tgz file from my browser,  \nthen go to the terminal in that folder and do a \"sudo R CMD INSTALL  \npackagename.tgz\".\n\nBut perhaps I am doing something wrong and one can do this properly  \nfrom within R.app, I would love to be wrong on this one.\n\n > sessionInfo()\nR version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)\npowerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0\n\nlocale:\nen_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] \"stats\"     \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"utils\"     \"datasets\"   \n\"methods\"   \"base\"\n >\n\nHaris Skiadas\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science\nHanover College\n\nOn Apr 12, 2007, at 6:04 PM, Weiwei Shi wrote:\n\n> Hi, there:\n>\n> After I upgraded my R to 2.4.1, it is my first time of trying to use\n> MASS and found the following error message:\n>> install.packages(\"MASS\")\n> --- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---\n> trying URL 'http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/universal/ \n> contrib/2.4/VR_7.2-33.tgz'\n> Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 995260 bytes\n> opened URL\n> ==================================================\n> downloaded 971Kb\n>\n>\n> The downloaded packages are in\n> \t/tmp/RtmpmAzBwa/downloaded_packages\n>\n>> library(MASS)\n> Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :\n> \tunable to load shared library\n> '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/library/ \n> MASS/libs/i386/MASS.so':\n>   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/ \n> library/MASS/libs/i386/MASS.so,\n> 6): Library not loaded:\n> /usr/local/gcc4.0/i686-apple-darwin8/lib/libgcc_s.1.0.dylib\n>   Referenced from:\n> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/library/MASS/ \n> libs/i386/MASS.so\n>   Reason: image not found\n> Error: package/namespace load failed for 'MASS'\n>\n>\n>> sessionInfo()\n> R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)\n> i386-apple-darwin8.8.1\n>\n> locale:\n> en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n>\n> attached base packages:\n> [1] \"stats\"     \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"utils\"     \"datasets\"\n> \"methods\"   \"base\"\n>\n> other attached packages:\n> randomForest        dprep\n>     \"4.5-18\"        \"1.0\"\n>\n>\n>> version\n>                _\n> platform       i386-apple-darwin8.8.1\n> arch           i386\n> os             darwin8.8.1\n> system         i386, darwin8.8.1\n> status\n> major          2\n> minor          4.1\n> year           2006\n> month          12\n> day            18\n> svn rev        40228\n> language       R\n> version.string R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)\n>\n>\n> Thanks\n> -- \n> Weiwei Shi, Ph.D\n> Research Scientist\n> GeneGO, Inc.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
