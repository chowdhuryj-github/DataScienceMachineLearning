Anyway, this is my \nfirst post on a subscriber list at all.\nI'm not a person who write a lot in english. I wish you will understand me.\n\n I've got the Debian 4.0 r0 \"Etch\" DVDs and I want to install it on a Laptop \nToshiba satellite P200\n(PSPB0C-RT208C). It's possible (compatibility)?  Windows Vista won't give me \nsome problems (I'm expecting a dual boot)?\n\nRecently, someone told me about tatooed laptops. It is the case of \nToshiba's laptops? Do someone know?\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
