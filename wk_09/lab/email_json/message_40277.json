But as we\nfirst have to find that word, we have an ordered list of the words...\n\nSo there is no perfect candidate in the above list.\nBut in my opinion they are still more \"english\" than \"hash\".\nAdditionally I believe it would be easier to learn that it's (e.g.) a\ndictionary that just is not ordered than learning a whole new word like\na \"hash\" (which it was for me as a non-native english speaker).\n\n-- \nThomas Wittek\nhttp://gedankenkonstrukt.de/\nJabber: streawkceur@jabber.i-pobox.net\n\n"}
