So, regardless of\nwhether the person agrees to the license, they have the freedom to use\nthe work.\n\nThe problem comes when the installer refuses to install the work\nwithout receiving acceptance of the GPL; this goes against what the\nlicense says (i.e. that even a person who says \"no\" to such a question\nhas the right to install and use the work.\n\nHaving received such a work, I suppose the license grants permission\nto use the work *despite* what the installer does; so, installing the\nsoftware \"manually\" by extracting it in a way that avoids such a\nquestion would be explicitly granted. That's a pointless hurdle to put\nbefore the user, though; ideally the meaningless \"Accept the license\"\nstep should be removed.\n\n-- \n \\            \"Beware of and eschew pompous prolixity.\"  -- Charles A. |\n  `\\                                                         Beardsley |\n_o__)                                                                  |\nBen Finney\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
