Have you perhaps tried get file1.tar file2.tar? I have not tried this myself; however, I think it may be workable. As for how often Ncftp/Lftp will try putting before giving up, I \nthink Lftp is more agressive than Ncftp. In fact, I have never actually seen Lftp time out a transfer because of a drop in net connection/etc, whereas Ncftp times out after a while. There may \nbe a way to get Ncftp to wait forever; perhaps there is a setting somewhere to control the timeout value(s).\nOn Sun, Jun 24, 2007 at 11:26:22PM -0700, Gregory Nowak wrote:\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n> \n> Hi all.\n> \n> Say I want to get 2 files via ftp, but I want to do it in a specific\n> order, and I don't want file2 to start downloading until file1 is\n> finished downloading.
