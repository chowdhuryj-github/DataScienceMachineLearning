A much abridged version ran in Wired a while back. From\nthe original: \"Ryan Lackey wears body armor to business meetings. He\nflies armed helicopters to client sites. He has a cash flow problem: he\nis paid in hundred-dollar bills, sometimes shrink-wrapped bricks of them,\nand flowing this money into a bank is difficult. He even calls some of\nhis company's transactions 'drug deals' \\u2014 but what Lackey sells is\nInternet access. From his trailer on Logistics Staging Area Anaconda, a\ncolossal US Army base fifty miles north of Baghdad, Lackey runs Blue\nIraq, surely the most surreal ISP on the planet.
