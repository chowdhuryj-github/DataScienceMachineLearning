Plus, heightened planetary energy in October will seal in the lucky effects for you. With the meeting of the Venus and Uranus on May 25th bringing you powerful vibrations for changing your life for the better, you can get in synch with an unusually fortunate series of astrological events that will mark the beginning of 367 days of Intense Happiness for you!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You must understand that we have to join forces against the negative waves that are frustrating you and\u00a0affecting your life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The urgency and power of this unique situation for your happiness made me realize that my dear friend, Joan Mudle, a psychic astrologer with 27 years of experience, was the ideal person to do some essential personal psychic groundwork for you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one is better than Joan Mudle at transforming powerful waves of psychic energy, so to give you the clearest understanding of the forces around you and how you can turn them to your extreme advantage, I want Joan Mudle to explain everything to you in her own words.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I know Joan Mudle can really help you, Memo, so please pay close attention to what she has to tell you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My dear Memo,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, I can't believe how lucky it was that Rochelle gave me this chance to make contact with you, especially at this time of such tremendous opportunity for change and good fortune in your life. As Rochelle mentioned, I've done some essential personal psychic groundwork for you, and you've probably already noticed some positive changes around you.\u00a0 Think about it...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My groundwork is now finished, and it has proved to be particularly encouraging. But there's still a lot to be done. May 25th will start an extremely interesting period that you must not let pass you by under any circumstances.\u00a0 That's why I absolutely want you to rediscover your full personal luck potential before this date!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I know you're a good subject for this kind of experience. You seem to be particularly receptive to my positive waves. Maybe you even have some gifts as a medium without even knowing it!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I see us reaching that blessed day together, when we'll be able to announce your extraordinary success for everyone to hear, when you will finally be free of all your stress and financial and other problems... and when everything in your life will be back in order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we're not there yet, Memo. Before celebrating this great day, we need to work together to analyze the different aspects of your current difficulties.\u00a0 Your main problem is most likely a money problem. This is the problem most of my correspondents and friends ask me to solve first. So this is the one we will attend to first and foremost.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's true that for certain people this money problem is particularly dramatic. That's why I'm especially sensitive to it. I must say, though, that I received contradictory impressions from you.\u00a0 Yes, contradictory, because I was seeing you with no financial problems whatsoever!\u00a0 That probably makes you smile. I'm sure that this impression from me must surprise you... but I can assure you that I am very rarely mistaken.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, what does this \"impression\" mean?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think it means that very soon you won't be bothered by financial problems anymore. That they will have disappeared, flown out of your life as if they had never existed for you. Otherwise, what other explanation could there possibly be for my impression?\u00a0\nIt even seems to me that an opportunity to win a lot of money recently presented itself to you, perhaps just several months ago. Think about it...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look, I have to be sincere with you.\u00a0 You were totally incapable of taking advantage of this generous opportunity that was offered to you. And for what very good reason?\u00a0 You were then -- and still are -- under the influence of these frustrating negative waves.\u00a0 You didn't dare to act, and the opportunity passed you right by, as it often does.\u00a0 A little too often, in fact...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But above all, Memo, don't be angry with yourself.\u00a0 Anyone else in your situation would have reacted in the exact same way, believe me.\u00a0 But this period has changed; from today on you're no longer isolated in the face of your destiny -- you and I are partners now.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You and your faith, me and my psychic powers!\nThis new period of luck will be bountiful. I can already feel it vibrating very deeply in me!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This lucky period starts for you at the very beginning of May 25th, 2007 and will reach its peak exactly 159  days later, on October 31st, 2007 (the second very important date in your life...)!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that, you'll still have 208 days left in the lucky period, then, that's it. It'll all be over -- unless you've learned by then to take charge of your luck, to grab it with both hands and direct it where you choose!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should seize this new financial opportunity being offered to you together!\nYou should profit from this financial opportunity. As I told you, my psychic impressions prove it!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What surprises me the most, Memo, is that despite repeated failures, your luck since your birth has remained almost totally intact. That's so rare that it deserves mention.\u00a0 That means that you still have the ability to change the course of your life.\u00a0 Your luck is there, intact and ready to act for your benefit. It's just waiting for you to order it into action. So I'm telling you: Don't wait!\u00a0 Act now!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we're only talking about your financial problems now -- we are forgetting the emotional side of your personality.\u00a0 You are also in the midst of negotiating a very important turning-point in your emotional and family life.\u00a0 Despite your financial difficulties, Memo, you've succeeded in maintaining a certain bond of intimacy with your close friends and loved ones.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so much the better for them and for you.\u00a0 You really must decide to free yourself from this heavy burden created by the negative waves you've been accumulating for so many, many years.\u00a0 It's your happiness and your future that we are talking about now, and by extension, the happiness and future of your close friends and loved ones.\u00a0 Yes, I see happiness and love headed your way, Memo, the love which you've always aspired to and which YOU DESERVE!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0YES, HAPPINESS AND LOVE WILL BE THERE, FAITHFULLY ON TIME FOR THE APPOINTMENT WE HAVE MADE WITH THEM!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Experience has shown me that very few people can single-handedly determine the deep reasons for their despair, much less chase them away.\u00a0 In fact, these particular reasons are often tied to what we could call unusual or \"paranormal\" reasons -- because it's not normal for fate to hound the same person to such a degree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put your mind at ease, Memo. The more I work on your personality, the more it appears to me, through the vibrations I receive from your spirit, that you do possess the positive elements of a better future.\u00a0 That's why, with this precious information about your future, I'm offering you here and now my personal beneficial help to free in you all the positive waves that are sleeping in your subconscious!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To free your positive forces and to drive away from your spirit the negative waves, that's my divine mission!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I possess this science, this philosophy, that makes me the true LIBERATOR of your hidden forces!\u00a0 I want to accomplish for you this \"magic\" intervention that you've been awaiting for so long and that will turn you into a HAPPY person!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Say YES to Luck.\u00a0\u00a0 Say YES to Love.\u00a0 Say YES to Happiness.\u00a0 You can, and above all, you DESERVE it!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understand me well, Memo, I'm offering to guide you towards a path paved with happiness and joy... but we have to act fast, because May 25th will mark the beginning of a period of intense luck which you cannot and should not miss!\u00a0 The coming weeks are going to be crucial for you, as well as for those close to you -- don't forget it!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Listen carefully! Your beneficial period of luck begins on May 25th, and will last 159 days and not one day more!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 159th day will be the highest point of this incredible period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your lucky period will end at dawn on the 367th day and won't recur for several years (according to my psychic estimate)!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your auspicious spiritual vibrations and I are offering you our help; above all, don't refuse it. Believe me, facing your destiny alone, it will be hard to win, while together we can do it much more easily, I'm giving you my word!\u00a0 In addition to the personal work I'm going to do on your behalf, indispensable in our fight against the negative forces that are blocking you, I will have to do for you a multi-contact telepathic action, as well as an intense psycho-magnetic action.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MY HELP IS FREE!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put your mind to rest, you won't have to spend a penny for all these miraculous actions. I am very pleased to offer them to you FREE.\u00a0 It will be my First Free Gift to you. Yes, my First Free Gift because I am going to offer you one more!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's my own way of welcoming you into the wonderful new world that awaits you...
