If you want to\nreplace the observations from 1985-01-02 until 1985-01-09 by a single\nobservation, maybe you want something like\n  new.time <- as.Date(8 * floor(as.numeric(time(z))/8) + 7)\n  z2 <- aggregate(z, new.time, mean)\nwhich gives averages for 8 days (anchored on the last day of the 8-day\nperiod).\n\nDoes this what you're looking for? Look at the \"zoo\" vignettes for more\ninformation/examples.\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
