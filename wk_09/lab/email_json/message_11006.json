Alas, I have more modest\nneeds.  I was wondering if it was possible to just send a string to\nSTDERR with cat() while in CMD BATCH mode.\n\nIs it not possible to open STDERR in R?  (Or does R use STDERR for\nitself and redirect it into the output stream?)\n\nThis would be on a standard Unix (gentoo) system and R 2.4.x.\n\n/iaw\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
