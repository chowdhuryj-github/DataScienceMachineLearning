But I've got it working now.  Here are my notes \n(including some nekkid T23 pictures!)\n    http://home.comcast.net/~jyavner/T23/\n\nGetting it all to work was so much effort that there must be lots of \nother people out there with T23's whose Debian just doesn't work right.  \nMaybe I should make up a DVD install disk that wipes a T23's hard drive \nand installs a system that \"just works\", the way Debian is supposed to?\n\nI looked around on eBay.  Lots of people are selling generic Etch \ninstall disks for $10, but I can't find anyone selling Etch pre-tuned \nfor a specific platform, which seems much more valuable.  It took me \nabout 50 hours to get Debian-on-T23 working; how much is your time \nworth?\n\nWhat do others think?  I suppose it would be less unusual to buy used \nT23's, install Debian, then resell them, but I want to avoid those \ninventory hassles.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
