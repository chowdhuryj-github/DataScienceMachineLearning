Abas, you will learn in our lead story, is \n      trying to convert Muslims to the true, peaceful path of Islam. Abas once \n      lived for the jihad, helping to run a terrorist training school in the \n      jungles of Southeast Asia, until the new dictum from Osama bin \n      Laden to kill civilians shocked his sensibilities. It was too late to take \n      back what he had already done. He realized that he had trained the \n      terrorists who had detonated two bombs that killed 202 people on \n      Bali in 2002. But he vowed to make up for \n      his mistakes and at no small risk to himself, has testified against agents \n      of his former al Qaeda-affiliated group, Jemaah Islamiya, and speaks \n      regularly to Islamic students to urge them to reject radicalism and \n      violence. \"We need to educate \n      people.\u00a0We need to give more explanation, about what is right, what \n      is wrong\u2026this is my new jihad,\" Nasir tells correspondent Bob \n      Simon.\n\u00a0\nWatch an excerpt of Simon's \n      report.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTalk radio has no shortage of \n      hosts who have declared jihad against illegal immigrants, but now \n      television has one too, and an unlikely one at that.\u00a0In our second \n      story, you'll meet the transformed Lou Dobbs, CNN anchor who once reported \n      business news with all its elite corporations and profits, now reborn as a \n      populist pundit standing up for the common man and, oftentimes, railing \n      against a common enemy: illegal immigrants.\u00a0Correspondent Lesley Stahl is \n      surprised to learn that Dobbs, though he never called for their \n      deportation, believes the U.S. could deport all the \n      estimated 12 million illegal immigrants if it wanted to. \"Because this is \n      the United \n      States. I think this country can do \n      anything it sets its mind to,\" says Dobbs.\n\u00a0\nWatch an excerpt of Stahl's \n      report.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeventy-four year-old Teri \n      Horton, an ex-truck driver, has set her mind to something and she won't \n      let go.\u00a0She has turned down $2 million for a painting she paid $5 \n      for. She\u2019s not crazy, just convinced \u2013 and there\u2019s a fingerprint on the \n      back that matches one from the artist\u2019s studio \u2013 that the big, drippy \n      painting is a Jackson Pollock. Our third story pits this feisty, \n      plainspoken woman against the connoisseurs of the art world who won\u2019t \n      accept that this thrift store purchase is really an abstract impressionist \n      masterpiece maybe worth $50 million.
