I'll keep rolling the Fedora packages in the\n3.0.24/3.0.25 series (ass needed) and you pick up the\npackaging/RHEL directory in SAMBA_3_0_26.  I'll do the\nsame for packaging/Debian/.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXICQIR7qMdg1EfYRAkdsAJ4lV5Zyo8szKgx7UCRpPB0kQ7TffgCeO2AN\nFboaxGGzVzi727QxEBkitMk=\n=tfE4\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
