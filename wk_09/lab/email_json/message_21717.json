The encrypted password consists of\n       13 to 24 characters from the 64 character alphabet a thru z, A thru Z,\n       0 thru 9, \\. and /. Optionally it can start with a \"$\" character. This\n       means the encrypted password was generated using another (not DES)\n       algorithm. For example if it starts with \"$1$\" it means the MD5-based\n       algorithm was used.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
