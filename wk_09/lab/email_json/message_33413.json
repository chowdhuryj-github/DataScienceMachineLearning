I don't want to go home in the dark.\n\nEnemies are so stimulating.\n\nPower is the by-product of understanding.\n\nWith me a change of trouble is as good as a vacation.\n\nThey are the only honest hypocrites, their life is a voluntary dream, a studied madness.\n\nThe place of justice is a hallowed place.\n\nKnowledge and human power are synonymous.\n\nTake no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself. [Matthew 6:34]\n\nDon't be humble, you're not that great.\n\nAll animals, except man, know that the principal business of life is to enjoy it.\n\nSetting goals for your game is an art. The trick is in setting them at the right level neither too low nor too high.\n\nSmile, for everyone lacks self-confidence and more than any other one thing a smile reassures them.\n\nWe don't laugh because we're happy -- we're happy because we laugh.\n\n\n"}
