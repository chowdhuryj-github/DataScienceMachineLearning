Kimpel)\n  - range checks disabled again (flexcel needs this)\n  - some other small fixes\n\n\no Function declarations as per v1.3.2\n  - read.xls( file,\n              colNames = TRUE,\n              sheet = 1,\n              type = \"data.frame\",\n              from = 1,\n              rowNames = NA, colClasses = NA, checkNames = TRUE,\n              dateTimeAs = \"numeric\",\n              stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors() )\n\n  - write.xls( x, file,\n               colNames = TRUE,\n               sheet = 1,\n               from = 1,\n               rowNames = NA )\n\n  - dateTimeToStr( odate, format = \"\" )\n  - strToDateTime( sdate )\n  - dateTimeToIsoStr( odate, isoformat = \"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\" )\n  - isoStrToDateTime( sdate )\n\n\no Download\n\n  - CRAN (v1.3.2; from within RGui) or\n  - http://treetron.googlepages.com/ (v1.3.3)\n    - direct link to package:\nhttp://treetron.googlepages.com/xlsReadWrite_1.3.3.zip\n    - direct link to test-/demoscripts:\nhttp://treetron.googlepages.com/xlsReadWrite_TestData_1.3.3.zip\n\n  - the testscript is used for our internal \"unittests\". It will show\nyou many examples of how to use the package.\n\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome.\nHope you enjoy using xlsReadWrite!\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nHans-Peter\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
