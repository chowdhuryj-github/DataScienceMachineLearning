As I will\nexplain further, you are restricted to file sizes of less than 4 GB.\nI agree, it is compatable with both linux and windows so at least you\ncan share files back and forth.\n\nI have a 200 GB USB drive I bought a year or so ago and it had a FAT32\nfile system on it.  I thought I would go ahead and start using it to\nbackup my stuff.  Well, both tar and winzip dutifully built my backups\nfor me but they each resulted in archives larger than 4GB and both\nsubsequently failed with size limit errors.  I either would have to\nbreak them up into chunks to fit or do what I ultimately did.  I\nrepartitioned the drive with two partitions - one with NTFS and the\nother being ext3.  Now I can backup all I want with no size limit\nissues; unless I get too big and run out of space:) but that's another matter.\n-- \nHolmesGrown Solutions\nThe best solutions for the best price!\nhttp://holmesgrown.ld.net/\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
