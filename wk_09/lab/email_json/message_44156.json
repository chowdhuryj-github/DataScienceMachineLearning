She also insisted Democrats should focus their policy critiques on Republicans, especially        President Bush.\n\n\"The differences among us are minor. The differences between us and Republicans are major, and we don't want anybody in America to be confused,\" she said.\n\nShe chuckled as her rivals were quizzed over what role her husband, former President        Bill Clinton, would play in a Democratic administration. The consensus: He'd be a roving global ambassador.\n\nObama, who in the first debate in late April appeared nervous and insufficiently prepared, had a smoother delivery this time and a more detailed grasp of policy issues.\n\nSo it was left to Edwards, struggling to catch up to Clinton and Obama in most national polls, to throw the sharpest elbows, accusing them of being passive and cautious on urgent issues, like        Iraq, health care and gay rights.\n\n--!>              \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
