These only relate to\ntcpwrappers, the tcpd or inetd daemons which can \ncontrol port access. I personally think such \"super\"\ndaemons are dangerous and do not run them at all.\nOne process, inetd, or similar, has the ability to open\nany or all ports, seems like a great possible target to\ncompromise a system.\n\nUsing hosts.deny is not equivalent to the iptables, \nwhich will drop packets at the firewall, I think \nTyler's intention is a good one, better than deny \nby the tcpwrapper process.\n\n> I don't have an ip.deny file\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
