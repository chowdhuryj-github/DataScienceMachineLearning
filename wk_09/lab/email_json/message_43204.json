The below toy dataset is\nsummarized from http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/modules/wtol_transpose.htm.\n\nI have searched CPAN and google and the list to the best of my ability for any\nhints related to transposing a \"long\" dataset to a \"wide\" dataset and vice\nversa. I assume I am missing an obvious solution to what I presume is a common\ndilemma?\n\n\nLONG:\nfamid year faminc\n1 96 40000 \n1 97 40500 \n1 98 41000 \n2 96 45000 \n2 97 45400 \n2 98 45800 \n3 96 75000 \n3 97 76000 \n3 98 77000\n\ndesired output,WIDE: .\nObs    famid    _NAME_    faminc96    faminc97    faminc98\n 1       1      faminc      40000       40500       41000\n 2       2      faminc      45000       45400       45800\n 3       3      faminc      75000       76000       77000\n\nVariables I think I would need to make use of would be:\n1) BY--uniquely identifies an individual, an observation, a primary key etc\n2) ID--the category or grouping \n2) var--the variable values to be transposed\n3) prefix--(concatenated to the id for naming column output in long to wide)\n\nif anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem or pointers to an\nalready rolled solution I would be most appreciative.\n\nbest,\nsg\n\n\n\n-- \n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
