I've got like 38gb of music, and other files, and my hd is only 40 gb.\nMy idea was to move some folders that are expanding like the music folder to the other hd, and then mount it in media where the normal music folder was, and call it music.\nAny help would be appriciated.\nI tried hooking it up to the ide cable on the cd drive like it told me, and it didn't register it.\nThanks,\n~~TheCreator~~\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
