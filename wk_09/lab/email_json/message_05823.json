It would be nice to reduce that significantly.\n\nEither ResizableBooleanArray has been significantly refactored since\nthis ticket was submitted last year (it has been), or the ticket was\nnever true in the first place (possibly also true). In the current\nimplementation of ResizableBooleanArray and FixedBooleanArray, each bit\nof information is stored as a single bit of an unsigned char (Parrot_UInt1).\n\n"}
