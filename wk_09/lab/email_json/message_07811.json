I am aware that one could write a small\nprogram to do that, but I am speculating about whether a command is\nalready existent.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
