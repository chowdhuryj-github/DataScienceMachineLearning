Hence there is no Windows version for R-2.5.0 currently \navailable on CRAN.\n\n\nFor older versions of R (down to R-1.7.x):\nPlease either use the Windows binary version, r.g. by typing\n    install.packages(\"Design\")\nof the package or compile from sources yourself. Look like you just \nuncompressed some source package without installing it.\n\n\nQin Qin wrote:\n> Hi all:\n> \n> I tried to install design package for R used under the window.
