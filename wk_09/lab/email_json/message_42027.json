I am just wondering what is the advantages of the different\ndistros (what is the good points and bad points to each one). I have\npreviously used slackware, but found sometimes compiling software could\nbe a problem due to the continuation of using a 2.4 kernel and some of\nthe libs. I have also used gentoo which seemed to work well except for\nall configuration was left to be done by hand and if not careful while\ndoing an update you may find the system fails because of a change in the\nconfiguration options. How does debian compare? Also could anyone point\nme in the direction of a comparison of the different distros.\n\nFrom\nMichael Whapples\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
