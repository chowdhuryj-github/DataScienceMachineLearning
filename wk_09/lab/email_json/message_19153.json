Paths on Unix are\ndone by slash  eg /data/scripts/xyz.pl,  this represents (typically) C:\n\\cygwin\\data\\scripts\\xyz.pl.\n\nTo convert between Windows paths and cygwin paths use cygpath command\nline tool,  may be a function in perl as well.\n\nFor paths to files you can use the cygwin UNC\npaths.  //c/some/where/on/C/drive/xyz.pl or //server/share/directory\n\nActivestate is a perl implementation that is straight windows if you\nlike.  This might be a better fit to your task.\n\n-- \nKen Foskey\nFOSS developer\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
