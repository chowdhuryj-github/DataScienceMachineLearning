Using the RPMS from CRAN or from Fedora Extras?\n\nAlso, note that FC5 will reach EOL (End of Life) on June 29, which means\nthat you will receive no further updates (security, bug fixes, etc)\nafter that date.  You should really consider upgrading to FC6. \n\nF7 just came out and I am running it, but I would recommend that typical\nusers wait a while before doing so to give it time to stabilize.\n\nHTH,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
