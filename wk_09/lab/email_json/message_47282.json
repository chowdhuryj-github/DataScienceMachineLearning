Below is \nan example of what I want to do ->\n\n@line = <>;\n$surname = $line[1];\nchomp ($surname);\n$fname = $line[2];\nchomp ($fname);\nprint \"$surname, $fname\\n\";\n\nthis needs to loop through the array till the end but on each loop the \n$surname and $fname elements need to increment by 3, so the next time \nthe loop runs it will look something like this ->\n\n@line = <>;\n$surname = $line[4];\nchomp ($surname);\n$fname = $line[5];\nchomp ($fname);\nprint \"$surname, $fname\\n\";\n\nI would like to end up with a list of names only, eg ->\n\nsurname, firstname\nsurname, firstname\n\ni would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction on \nthis one. TIA.\n\nGian\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
