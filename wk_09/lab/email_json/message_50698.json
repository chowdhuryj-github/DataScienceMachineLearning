The option is written on a stock that today has a price of X. Nine months before i will have this situation:\n\nIf ab the option pays nothing\n\nThe price of the title is described by a geometric brownian motion, so i need to start a Montecarlo simulation to find the stock price using the gbm, and then using it for the evaluation of the option.\n\nMany thanks to anyone.\n\nLuca, from Italy.\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
