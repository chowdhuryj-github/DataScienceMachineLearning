Each individual answers as many\nquestions as they want, so there are a different number of rows per\nindividual.\n\nFor each number of questions, I want to run a logit on all the\nindividuals who saw that many questions, predicting whether they\nchoose to answer anymore afterwards by their choices on the earlier\nquestions.\n\nthe second logit would look like\nanswered_only_2~answer_1_pos+answer_1_neg+answer_2_pos+answer_2_neg\n\nThis will result in over 100 regressions, with different numbers of\nRHS variables.  I'd like to iterate over the sequence of numbers and\nrun a logit for each, but I can't find any means for dynamically\ngenerating the RHS variable from an array, or vector.  The only way I\ncan think of to write the function would still require the same number\nof RHS variables in each regression.\n\nIs there a way to dynamically generate the right hand side?\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
