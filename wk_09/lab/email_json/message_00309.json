I found that bug report after I had submitted my query.\nI would like to know whether compiling a pristine kernel 2.6.19 would\nnot break IPtables, because I think the IPTables package in Debian\nrequires certain kernel patches not found in the official sources.\n\nRegards.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
