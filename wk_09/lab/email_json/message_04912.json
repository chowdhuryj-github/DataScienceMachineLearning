So if you insert a picture into an HTML \nfile, then the picture is \"copied\" into it.  It doesn't have to be \nphysically copied (to save space) but can just be copied when it needs \nto be (e.g., if the original image is edited or deleted).\n\nThis seems simple to explain to users (because you don't have to explain \nit to users at all, things Just Work).  It requires a richer sense of a \nresource than just a file -- a web page, for instance, is not just an \nHTML file, but a whole set of files that include all the embedded resources.\n\n-- \nIan Bicking | ianb@colorstudy.com | http://blog.ianbicking.org\n             | Write code, do good | http://topp.openplans.org/careers\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
