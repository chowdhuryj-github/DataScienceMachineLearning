That  is probably the major problem I am\nhaving getting the files to load in SAS. I knew it was\na format problem but since the format worked with SPSS\nI didn't think of that.\n\n\n> \n> Also, is the carriage return after '\"C:/Program  in\n> the code below caused\n> by copying and pasting into the email or is the code\n> that way in your\n> program?\n\nThat's a Cut & Paste problem but thanks for catching\nit.\n\nWell time to finish lunch and hike back to the\ncomputer lab.  I'm beginning to regret being to cheap\nto ask for an SAS licence :(\n\nI may get this running today after all.  I really\ndon't want to do a SAS > SPSS > R route.  It is a bit\ntoo much like a Rube Goldbeg cartoon.\n\nThanks\n\n> \n> Regards,\n>     -Cody\n> \n> \n> \n>                                                     \n>                       \n>              John Kane                              \n>                       \n>                                     \n>              ca>                                    \n>                    To \n>              Sent by:                 \n> tchur@optusnet.com.au               \n>              r-help-bounces@st                      \n>                    cc \n>              at.math.ethz.ch           R R-help\n>  \n>                                                     \n>               Subject \n>                                        Re: [R]\n> sas.get problem             \n>              04/11/2007 07:41                       \n>                       \n>              AM                                     \n>                       \n>                                                     \n>                       \n>                                                     \n>                       \n>                                                     \n>                       \n>                                                     \n>                       \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> --- Tim Churches  wrote:\n> \n> > John Kane wrote:\n> > > I  have 3 SAS files all in the directory F:/sas,\n> > two\n> > > data files\n> > > and a format file :\n> > > form.ea1.sas7bdat\n> > > form.ea2.sas7bdat\n> > > sas.fmts.sas7bdat\n> > >\n> > > F is a USB.\n> \n> > > I am using R2.4.1 under Windows XP\n> > > SAS files were created with SAS 9.x\n> > > They convert easily into SPSS 14\n> \n> > > Example.\n> > >\n> > > library(Hmisc)\n> > > mydata <- sas.get(library=\"F:/sas\",\n> > mem=\"form.ea1\",\n> > >              format.library=\"sas.fmts.sas7bdat\",\n> > >            sasprog = '\"C:Program Files/SAS/SAS\n> > > 9.1/sas.exe\"')\n> > >\n> > > Error message  (one of several that I have\n> gotten\n> > > while trying various things.)\n> > > The filename, directory name, or volume label\n> > syntax\n> > > is incorrect.\n> > > Error in sas.get(library = \"F:/sas\", mem =\n> > \"form.ea1\",\n> > > format.library = \"sas.fmts.sas7bdat\",  :\n> > >         SAS job failed with status 1\n> > > In addition: Warning messages:\n> > > 1: sas.fmts.sas7bdat/formats.sc? or\n> > formats.sas7bcat\n> > > not found.
