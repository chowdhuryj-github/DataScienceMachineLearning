I think it's the scrole lock. I cant\nremember the name of the button. sorry. it's late. it's the third button\nin from the top row on the right. that says you killed speakup. then I\npress insert and enter and it says you turned me off but when I'm in\ngnome and I'm using orca keystrokes speakup starts talking again.  I\ndon't want to unlode speakup from memory as I often go back to a console\nto continue working on other things so I would really like to know how\nto just temporarily stop it.  \n\nOr maybe I do need to completely unlode the module.  but, how do I do\nthis without needing a reboot to get it working again? using modprobe\nspeakup_apollo doesn't work after using the command rmmod.  \nnow, I may have that rmmod command wrong. It's been some time since I\nused it and as I said, it's late and I'm probably not thinking as clarly\nas usual.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
