It apparently dozes while cruising at 25 mph. \n      \n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS\nHere is an early preview \n      of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING NEWS from Anchor and \n      Managing Editor, Katie Couric... Hi everyone, \n      Tonight we'll begin our broadcast with the news that embattled \n      radio host Don Imus has been fired from CBS. The announcement came late \n      this afternoon from CBS President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie \n      Moonves. We'll have extensive coverage of this story, beginning with \n      Nancy Cordes with all the late breaking details of the decision. \n      Then we'll turn to CBS News' Jeff Greenfield and Washington \n      Post columnist Eugene Robinson for analysis. Also tonight, \n      we'll have the story of a deadly attack directed at the Iraqi government. \n      A suicide bomb exploded inside what is supposed to be the most protected \n      area of Baghdad - the heavily fortified Green Zone. A bomber blew himself \n      up in the cafeteria of the Iraqi parliament, killing at least eight \n      people, including several lawmakers. Martin Seemungal will have the \n      story. Today in Afghanistan, U.S.-led forces bombed weapon-filled \n      caves killing an estimated 35 militants. The strikes happened as the war \n      in Afghanistan is reaching a critical point: The Taliban are expected to \n      launch a spring offensive. Chief Foreign Correspondent Lara Logan \n      reports from the frontlines on how NATO plans to strike first. \n      Another career hanging in the balance is that of Durham County \n      district attorney Mike Nifong. Yesterday's announcement that charges \n      against the Duke lacrosse players were dropped also brought increased \n      scrutiny against Nifong, whose investigation into the sexual assault \n      accusation was called a \"tragic rush to accuse.\" Kelly Wallace will \n      have an update. And finally, a legend in American writing died \n      today. Known for countercultural novels such as Cat's Cradle and \n      Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut was a legendary social critic \n      who also wrote dozens of short stories, essays and plays. Richard \n      Schlesinger will take a look at the life of this writer and his \n      influence on 20th Century literature. I hope you'll join \n      us.

In \n      October 1997, 31-year-old Heather Grossman and her husband, John, were \n      fired on in their car at an intersection in broad daylight. It was clearly \n      an attempted execution of a wealthy and socially prominent couple. The \n      bullet that struck John only grazed him, but another bullet severed \n      Heather' spinal cord, leaving her a quadriplegic. Today, she is still \n      confined to a wheelchair. And there is no chance of rehabilitation. Of \n      course, the question on everyone's mind was who would want to kill this \n      attractive mother of three and her second husband? Who would orchestrate \n      and then carry out this drive-by shooting... and why? In quick order \n      investigators found the shooter and three other men who confessed about \n      their roles in the scheme. They were drug addicts and petty thieves. \n      Surprisingly, they didn't know Heather Grossman or her husband. And they \n      weren't looking to rob the couple. During interrogation all four men told \n      the same story. They were given orders to kill Heather Grossman. As \n      investigators kept digging, the murder for hire plot began unraveling and \n      all the evidence seemed to lead to one conclusion. It would take nearly a \n      decade for this mystery to be resolved... and for the architect behind \n      this devastating shooting to be brought to justice. You will hear from \n      everyone involved in this explosive case... the victim, the shooter and \n      the person who was convicted for pulling the strings... in the next \n      48 Hours Mystery.\" - Troy Roberts\n(48 Hours Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT)\nIf you would like more information on any of these stories or the \n      broadcast, please click on the following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSUNDAY \n      ON\u00a060 MINUTES\nINNOCENT: In their first \n      interviews since all charges against them were dropped, the three former \n      Duke lacrosse players once charged with rape tell Lesley Stahl how \n      they feel about being exonerated.
