Of the people who spoke, it was \nonly the 3 NDP members who urged caution on the general trend suggested \nin this legislation.  Mr. Angus took some time to speak about copyright \nin general, opposition to the outdated 1996 WIPO treaties, and so-on.\n\n-- \n  Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n  Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n  rights as owners of Information Technology.
