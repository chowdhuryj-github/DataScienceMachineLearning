I would like to have a bar graph of\na count of the types(ie. The number of types) of recods by hour grouped\nby year.  So the count of the types would be the y axis, the hour on the\nx axis and then grouped by year for easy comparison.  I think that I\nhave to use barchart however I don't know how to get barchart to do a\ncount and not graph values.\nThanks\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
