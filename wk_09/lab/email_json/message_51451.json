They're running into a small problem with\npermission settings.\n\nBasically, the default mappings that Samba performs in order to store\npermissions (the stuff done in dosmode.c, mostly) is \"changing\" the bits\nthat the end-users are setting.  They'd like to more closely preserve the\nNTFS permission settings.\n\nIt appears as though this is something that could be done using the VFS\nlayer.  In particular, I should be able to store the full NTFS ACE in an EA.\n Something I read suggests that Samba 4 is already doing this.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience setting this up under Samba 3?\n\nChris -)-----\n\n-- \n\"Implementing CIFS - the Common Internet FileSystem\" ISBN: 013047116X\nSamba Team -- http://www.samba.org/     -)-----   Christopher R.
