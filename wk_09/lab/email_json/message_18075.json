Using 'ci.type = \"ma\"' may be less potentially\n     misleading.\n\nalso see the description of the ci and ci.type arguments. As far as\nHOW they are calculated, I believe that the default is\n\nqnorm(c(0.025, 0.975))/sqrt(n)\n\nAnd yes, I think that they are very important.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nEric\n\n\nOn 4/27/07, tom soyer  wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> I noticed that whenever I ran acf or pacf, the plot generated by R always\n> includes two horizontal blue doted lines.
