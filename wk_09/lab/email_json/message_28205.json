Matthais Gamer has offered \nto host the following functions in the \"irr\" package:\n\nkripp.alpha (Krippendorff's alpha)\nmcnemar.mh (McNemar marginal homogeneity test)\nrater.bias (test of bias between two raters)\nstuart.maxwell.mh (Stuart-Maxwell marginal homogeneity test)\n\nThe \"quest.reliability\" function will move to Harold Doran's \n\"MiscPsycho\" package, although perhaps with some alterations.\n\nIf any package maintainers are interested in a function to compute \nPage's Trend Test, let me know. Rather than start up an \"R-bay\" for \nfunctions, I will donate it free to a good home.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
