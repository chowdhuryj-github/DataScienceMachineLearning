I have\nlearned to convert to a vector of time strings, and for the sake of\nplotting times of day vs. heights of tide (to examine seasonality\ncomponent) I can extract HH:mm pretty swiftly and readily from\nUnixtime using emacs calc.  However, I have had trouble with decimal\nhours that are needed (or perhaps not) for at least one of the polar\nplotting packages.\n\nIs there an easy way to do this in R?\n\nThank you for any ideas.  (I have learned how to do simple polar plots\nby way of a couple of people on this list.  Thanks very much.)\n\nAlan\n\n-- \nAlan Davis, Kagman High School, Saipan  lngndvs@gmail.com\n\nI consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I\nmust share it with other people who like it.\n--------Richard Stallman\n\nEvery great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute\nrejection of authority.  ----- Thomas H.
