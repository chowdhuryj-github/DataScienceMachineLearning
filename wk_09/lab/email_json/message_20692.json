The decision\nrepresents \"a concern that the past year has been characterized by an\noverall deterioration in the protection and enforcement\" of\nintellectual property.\n\nThe 52-page report names 43 countries in all that are being monitored\nwith 10 countries on the most serious, \"priority watch list.\"\n\"Countries on the priority watch list do not provide adequate level of\n(intellectual priority rights) protection or enforcement, or market\naccess for persons relying on intellectual property protection,\" the\nso-called \"special 20 report\" said of the 10 priority watch list\ncountries, that include China and Russia.\n\nThe trade representative said the Thai government in late 2006 and\nearly 2007 announced decisions to issue several \"compulsory licenses\nfor several patented pharmaceutical products.\"\n\nIn Abbott's case, the North Chicago-based drug giant has been embroiled\nin a dispute with Thai officials over pricing of the AIDS drug Kaletra\nand Thailand's efforts to make generic copies of the medicine that\neffectively would break Abbott's patent protection. Thailand earlier\nthis year said that it could not afford the price Abbott charges for\nKaletra, and planned to use a provision of international trade law that\nwould have allowed it to skirt Kaletra's patent protection and choose\nother companies to copy the drug. That move represented a significant\nchallenge to Abbott's patent protections.\n\nAbbott countered by announcing that it would not register any newly\ndeveloped drugs in Thailand, depriving that country of a new form of\nKaletra that -- in contrast to the current form -- does not require\nrefrigeration.\n\nAIDS activists, who protested the company just last week, have\ncondemned Abbott's action as \"blackmail,\" suggesting that withholding\nthe Kaletra that does not require refrigeration is putting patients'\nhealth at risk. Given Thailand's hot climate and underdeveloped\nhealth-care infrastructure, many people do not have access to Abbott's\nAIDS drugs, the activists charge.\n\nbjapsen@tribune.com\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
