This need to be secure and reliable (we plan to add GPG support or some kind of digital signatures) and I'm wondering if this should be done with telepathy (tubes) or can be done with xml-rpc or maybe some other (\"easier\") alternative.\nThanks-- Nolambar von L\u00f3meanorhttp://nolambar.blogspot.com <- mi blog\n"}
