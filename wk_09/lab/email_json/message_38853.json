Far too unreliable,  we have exported CSV\nfrom excel that imported differently into excel.\n\nIs there another option,  eg connecting to Outlook via a remote\nconnection?\n\nIs there another format available?\n\nI doubt a simple regex will do it if the CSV modules do not work.\n\nWhat data do you have problems with?
