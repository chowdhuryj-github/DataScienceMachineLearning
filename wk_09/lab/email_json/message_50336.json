We closed\nour doors tempporarily as a result, and spent the last week debugging\nthese problems. We believe we have them well solved. Consequently, it is\nonce again possible to purchase and download TTSynth.\n\nhttp://TTSynth.Com\n\nOf course we also provided packages through email to those few customers\nwho experienced problems with our initial release. We believe there are\nnow no outstanding issues.\n\nSpecifically, we had two problems to fix in our automated download process:\n\n1.)\tCustomers using Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows were\nunable to complete transactions. This is now fixed.\n\n2.)\tSome customers using Debian or Ubuntu experienced failures due\nto a bug we uncovered in the earlier version of GNU TLS used on these\ntwo distributions. Of course it is very important that your Internet\ntransaction is properly protected by SSL. This is now also fixed.\n\nConsequently, the premier Text To Speech (TTS) software synthesizer for\nLinux is once again available for immediate secure on line purchase and\ndownload using a credit card!\n\nAvailable Modules Include:\n     * IBM's incomparable IBM TTS text to speech (formerly called\n       ViaVoice)\n     * Gnome-Speech patched for use with LSR and Orca\n     * The TTSynth Speakup Bridge for screen reading with Speakup\n     * ttsynth_say binary for the CLI or for use in scripts\n     * Also supported by Emacspeak KTTS, and Speech Dispatcher\n\nAvailable Languages For Linux\n     * Chinese\n     * English\n     * Finnish\n     * French\n     * German\n     * Italian\n     * Japanese\n     * Portuguese\n     * Spanish\n\n   The best is also very affordable.
