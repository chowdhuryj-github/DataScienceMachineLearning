MCKINNON and GREG HITT\nMay 11, 2007; Page A2\n\nWASHINGTON -- After months of standstill, the White House and\ncongressional Democrats agreed to strengthen labor and environmental\nstandards in free-trade pacts, signaling a new bipartisan consensus\naimed at shoring up crumbling U.S. public support for economic\nglobalization.\n\nThe agreement -- announced last night by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top officials and lawmakers\n-- clears a hurdle to the passage of some small bilateral trade deals.\nAnd it could ultimately smooth the way for broader trade measures such\nas renewing President Bush's soon-to-expire authority to negotiate\ntrade deals without threat of congressional amendments, as well as a\nnew global trade agreement now being negotiated in the Doha Round of\nworld trade talks.\n\nLawmakers said the agreement would help provide broad bipartisan\nsupport in Congress for pending agreements with Peru and Panama. But,\nthey said other trade measures, including pacts with Colombia and South\nKorea, involve other issues that haven't been worked out.\n\nIn addition to including new labor and environmental principles, the\ndeal calls for expanded access for developing countries to generic\ndrugs, a priority for Democrats, who say efforts by brand-name drug\nmakers to protect their markets have put many medicines out of reach in\npoor countries.\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough in what we've been fighting for ... to be\nsure that globalization opens up for many more people, including\nworkers,\" said Rep. Sander Levin (D., Mich.), one of the negotiators.\nBefore Democrats were in a position to influence the debate, he said,\n\"I think Republicans were resisting a necessary trend to spread the\nbenefits of trade.\"\n\nThe deal also shows that, for all the squabbling between the White\nHouse and Capitol Hill on Iraq, the two sides have continued to find\nways to work together on other issues. Beyond trade, administration and\ncongressional leaders are feverishly negotiating to try and reach an\nagreement this month on immigration overhaul.\n\nWhile the trade pact has the solid backing of congressional leaders,\nany specific trade legislation could still face strong opposition among\nrank-and-file lawmakers and labor groups.\n\nThe drug industry trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers of America, declined to comment until it has reviewed the\nfinal agreement. But objections from the powerful lobby -- which\nsucceeded this week in killing a proposal to ease rules for\npharmaceutical imports -- would complicate prospects for passage.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said, even with the changes\nrelated to generic drugs, pending trade agreements would improve\nprotections for intellectual property abroad, including brand-name\npharmaceuticals. \"This is a compromise,\" she said. The drug provisions\napply to the pacts with Panama, Peru and Colombia, but not Korea, she\nsaid.\n\nThe push for free trade has been complicated by the rising U.S. trade\ndeficit. Yesterday, the Commerce Department said the country's overall\ndeficit surged to a six-month high of $63.9 billion in March, party\nbecause of a jump in oil imports. The report is causing economists to\nscale back estimates of first-quarter growth -- and is fueling new\ncriticism from Democratic lawmakers of the Bush administration's trade\npolicies.\n\nThe deal would require that core international labor standards be\nincorporated into trade pacts and would enforce those commitments with\nthe same sanctions used to back up business-backed priorities. In the\ncase of Peru, the changes will be accomplished through amendments that\nwon't require already agreed-to texts to be reopened, a congressional\nofficial said. The Panama deal, though largely completed, was left open\nto accommodate any compromise that might be struck by the White House\nand Democratic leaders.\n\nThe agreement isn't meant to open U.S. laws to challenge under the\nstrengthened labor commitments. But it doesn't include a specific\nassurance against that, according to the congressional official.\n\n--John McCary contributed to this article.\n\n---------------------------------\nThiru Balasubramaniam\nGeneva Representative\nKnowledge Ecology International (KEI)\nvoice +41.22.791.6727\nfax +41.22.723.2988\nmobile +41 76 508 0997\nthiru@keionline.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
