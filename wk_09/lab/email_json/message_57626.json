", "body": "# New Ticket Created by  Paul Cochrane \n# Please include the string:  [perl #43417]\n# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. \n# \n\n\nHi all,\n\nAs part of going through and converting internal_exception()s to\nreal_exception()s (see RT#40392) I've found several functions which\ncould use real_exception(), but to use this they would have to have\nthe interpreter passed in as an argument, hence changing their API.\nIs it worth changing these functions' API just for a real_exception()?\n\nComments most definitely welcome!\n\nPaul\n\n"}
