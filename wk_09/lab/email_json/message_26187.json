The 2007 standard mileage rate for the use of a car (including vans, pickups, or panel trucks) is 48.5 cents per mile for business miles driven.\nIf you do not have a clear and accurate business mileage record, the IRS may disallow the deduction.\nRelated Links:\n\nPublication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses\nPublication 535, Business Expenses\nFS-2006-26, Car and Truck Expense Deduction Reminders\u00a0 \n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0New Publication for Green Card Holders Explains U.
