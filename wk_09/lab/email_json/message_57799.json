Unfortunately, \ndroplinegnome does not include the speech-tools or festival packages or \nthe necessary add-ons from festvox.org. I've been trying to build both on \na kernel 2.4x system here without much luck.  I'll try again in my home \ndirectory since it has more space and maybe they'll build then. \ngnome-speech is also included in droplinegnome but since festival wasn't \navailable on my machine when I installed droplinegnome it built in such a \nway that it excluded all speech servers like festival.  So first get \nspeech-tools and festival built and working then install droplinegnome and \nif all works orca will talk on your end.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
