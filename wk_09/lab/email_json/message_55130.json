It's my\nunderstanding that the later has replaced the former.  If so, the XMP\ntemplate from the license chooser should be updated to the new\nnamespace.  I can also update the wiki where the former namespace is\nused.  Seeing both and wondering if there is a difference has been a\nsource of confusion, at least to me.\n\nAlso, could the we get http://creativecommons.org/ns# to point to a\nschema description like at http://web.resource.org/cc/?\n\nCheers,\nJason\n_______________________________________________\ncc-devel mailing list\ncc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel\n\n"}
