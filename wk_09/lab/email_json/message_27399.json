It's about carbon \ndioxide...supposedly.\n\nI will never agree that carbon dioxide is pollution. In fact, without \ncarbon dioxide, there's no photosynthesis and we all die.\n\nNot a single scientist has been able to answer these simple questions:\n\n1. What is the optimum temperature of the Earth?\n\n2. What is the optimum percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n3. Why did we have global cooling through the 1950s, 1960s and half of \nthe 1970s?\n\n\n- Donny\n\n\n\n................................................................\n       Posted via TITANnews - Uncensored Newsgroups Access\n             >>>> at http://www.TitanNews.com <<<<\n-=Every Newsgroup - Anonymous, UNCENSORED, BROADBAND Downloads=-\n\n"}
