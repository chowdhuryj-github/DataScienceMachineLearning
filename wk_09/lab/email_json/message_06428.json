I assume that once\nyou hit ctrl+g to interact with the vm, you can use normal speakup\nreview keys, and get speech from a serial hardware synth, assuming you\ncorrectly redirected the virtual serial port to the machine's physical\nserial port? Did you use ssh to do the install, because interacting\nwith the vm isn't as simple as I assumed in my previous question, or\nwas it simply because you just wanted to use ssh to do the install, or\nbecause you didn't have a physical serial port/hardware synth?\nHas anyone tried running gnome in a vmware machine running on a\nwindows host? If this is all as straight forward as it sounds, and as\ngood as it sounds, I may not have to worry about gnu/linux compatible\nhardware, (I.E. modem, wireless card, on-board serial ports, ETC.), and about the\nwarranty if you resize partitions or remove windows, when looking for\na new laptop in the future.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Sun, Apr 15, 2007 at 07:41:41PM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hiya,\n>     I at least have found it to be a viable alternative so far, and would be \n> glad to describe my methodology as best I can.\n>     I downloaded VMWare server and installed it on Windows.
