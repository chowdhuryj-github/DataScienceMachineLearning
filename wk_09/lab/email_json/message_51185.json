I am\nrather embarrassed, the problem was one of basic R\nusage/syntax. When reordering the levels I just needed\nto replace data$group with group (i.e. omitting data$\nfrom the command) and all was well. I shall go and sit\nin the dog-house and do penance :(\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nRegards\n\nRichard\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
