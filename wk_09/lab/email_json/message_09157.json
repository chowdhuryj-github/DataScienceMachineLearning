Therefore, the dimension of euclidean distance matrix is 500,000*500,000. \nWhen I run the data in R. R could not make distance matrix because of memory allocation problem. \nIn order increase memory, I read the FAQ and follow the instruction as below: \nYou may also set the amount of available memory manually. Close R, then right-click on your R program icon (the icon on your desktop or in your programs directory). Select ``Properties'', and then select the ``Shortcut'' tab. Look for the ``Target'' field and after the closing quotes around the location of the R executible, add \n --max-mem-size=500M \nIt does not work.I have tried other computers in also does not work. \n \nWhen I add the --max-mem-size=3Gb in Target field. There is error like as below: \n\\u201cThe name \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Hong Su An\\My Documents\\R\\R-2.4.1\\bin\\Rgui.exe\"--max-mem-size=1024M specified in the Target box is not valid\\u201d \nI use R2.4.1. in window xp with sp2 and 4Gb RAM. \nHave a nice day. \nHong Su An.anhong@msu.eud\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
