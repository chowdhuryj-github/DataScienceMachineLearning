For example, some have \ndiscussed aumix as a mixer program.  It uses /dev/mixer, which is why it \ndoesn't show all controls.  Most programs, including Mplayer still default \nto OSS-compatible operation unless overridden.  So, until this changes, I \nconsider the OSS emulation mandatory.  There is the aoss command, which \ntries to make a program that would normally use OSS use ALSA instead, but \nit doesn't always work.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
