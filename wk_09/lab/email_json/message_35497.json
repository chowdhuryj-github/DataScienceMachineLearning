{"category": "ham", "to_address": "Tom Backer Johnsen <backer@psych.uib.no>", "from_address": "Gabor Csardi <csardi@rmki.kfki.hu>", "subject": "Re: [R] Social Network Analysis", "body": "Tom, thank you for the detailed answer and sorry for the long delay,\ni'm at a conference right now. This sadly means that i have no access to\nthe papers, it will take more time. \n\nBut in the meanwhile, here's a little program which might be useful,\n\nstructural.balance <- function(g) {\n\n  triples <- combn(1:vcount(g)-1, 3)\n  good <- bad <- 0\n  for (t in 1:ncol(triples)) {\n    \n    tri <- triples[,t]\n    edges <- E(g) [ tri %--% tri ]\n    if (length(unique(get.edges(g, edges))) < 3) { next }\n    if (prod(E(g)[edges]$sign) > 0) {\n      good <- good +1\n    } else {\n      bad <- bad +1\n    }\n  }\n  c(good, bad)\n}\n\nIt uses the igraph package, version 0.4 or higher. Basically it\nextracts all possible triples from the network and first checks\nwhether it is connected or not. If it is a connected triple then \nit simply multiples the values of the edges to see whether it is\npositive or negative.\n\nHere is a little test with a directed random graph with random\nedge values:\n\ng <- erdos.renyi.game(20, p=5/20, directed=TRUE)\nE(g)$sign <- sample( c(-1,1), ecount(g), repl=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5))\n\nstructural.balance(g)\n\nThe code is of course suboptimal, it is brute-force, but if your\nnetworks are small it might be good enough.\n\nBest Regards,\nGabor\n\nOn Mon, May 14, 2007 at 11:13:11PM +0200, Tom Backer Johnsen wrote:\n> Gabor Csardi wrote:\n> > Tom,\n> > \n> > check the igraph package.
