Before we began dating I was hearing stories of guys younger than me taking Vitamin V. Guys in their 20's and thirties were using Cialis and so I decided that I needed that same edge the younger guys were getting. 25mg is best for me and I have found that Cialis makes me a super stud and the girl rides me and always has an orgasm or two. it has made me much better in bed and I give her some very long and extended foreplay now. It has really helped my confidence knowing that if needed I can give it to her any time she wants it. V has to be the greatest invention since sliced bread.\ndennis king.\nYou can find it here \n\n\n"}
