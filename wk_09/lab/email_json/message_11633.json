He licenses the library out \nunder both the GPL and a commercial licence.\n\nA person Y uses libfoo under the GPL. He goes and does a lot of \nimprovements in the library since it is under the GPL. Now the modified \nversion of libfoo is copyrighted by both X and Y.\n\nSo X would not be able to import such improvements into the main \ndistribution of libfoo since then he would not be able to dual-licence \nit - specifically he would not be able to licence it commercially, not \nowning it entirely. He must either take Y into his business or obtain a \nwaiver from Y by one-time payment or whatever.\n\nMy question is: What would be considered a big enough \ndifference/modification that X would need Y's permission for backporting \nthe changes?\n\n1. If Y fixes a bug (of whatever severity) with a patch?\n\n2. If Y makes improvements to the library by optimizing some algorithms?\n\n3. If Y adds new functionality to the library?\n\n4. If Y just restructures the library in a more efficient manner.\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
