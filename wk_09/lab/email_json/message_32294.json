My problem is as follows\n\nKeep X2 at 20 and X3 at 2. Then compute the predicted probability (predprob) for the entire range of X1 ie from -10 to 10 with an increment of 1.\n\nTherefore i need the predicted probabilities when x1=-10, x1=-9....,x1=9, x1=10 keeping the other constant. \n\nCan somebody give me some direction on how this can be programmed. \n\nThanks in advance for your help\n\nSincerely\n\nAnup\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nGot a little couch potato? \nCheck out fun summer activities for kids.\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
