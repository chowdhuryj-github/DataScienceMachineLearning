Not sure what it means.\nthe -x- suggests an experimental name (though the spec just says it\nshould not start with and x- or x.). Also don't we wish to have xo\nsomewhere in the name so we can have different bundle types?  Just\nlooking to the future if we need to register other mime-types it would\nbe nice to have a single naming format for readability.\n\n-- \nJohn (J5) Palmieri \n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
