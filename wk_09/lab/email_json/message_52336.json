I \nnoticed that the spec.pgram function returns power curves for both \nindividual variables as well as coherence and phase information, but \nnothing about the co/quad spectrum. Does anyone have any experience with \nthis and know of a way to back the cross-spectra out of this information \nor know of another package?\n\nThanks\nBryan\n\n-- \nBryan Woods\nDept. of Geology & Geophysics\nYale University, KGL 234\n210 Whitney Ave\nNew Haven, CT 06511\n\n978.726.3462 (cell)\n203.432.3134 (fax)\n203.404.3365 (home)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
