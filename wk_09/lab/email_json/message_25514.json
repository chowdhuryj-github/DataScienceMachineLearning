In practice, I think it'll get a zero gradient as the algorithm does things numerically and you have a symmetric function. It probably then chooses gradient-related step sizes of zero and goes nowhere, converging instantly. The same happens at (0.1,0.1) and anywhere else along x=y.\n\nThe problem affects pretty much all gradient-only algorithms handed stationary points in a symmetric function.\n\nSolution? Ermm.. \"don't do that with a gradient method\", I suspect, though wiser heads may have more to say on the topic.\n\nS\n\n>>> \"Paul Smith\"  07/05/2007 22:30:32 >>>\nDear All\n\nI am trying to perform the below optimization problem, but getting\n(0.5,0.5) as optimal solution, which is wrong; the correct solution\nshould be (1,0) or (0,1).\n\nAm I doing something wrong?
