However, I cannot figure a way to do the same \nfor R scripts. In other words, I want to double-click on a .R file in \nExplorer, have RGui open, set the working directory to the location of \nwhere the script is saved, and load the script into the script editor. \nIs this possible?\n\nThanks,\n\n--sundar\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
