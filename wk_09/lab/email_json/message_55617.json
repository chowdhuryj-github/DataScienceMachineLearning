This step\nprimarily overwrites a lot of settings in the Configure database to disable\nJIT and *match ANSI characteristics* (emphasis added).\n\nHow this package disables JIT is fairly self-evident because the attribute names are self-\ndocumenting:\n\n        jitarchname        => 'nojit',\n        jitcpuarch         => 'i386',\n        jitcpu             => 'I386',\n        jitosname          => 'nojit',\n        jitcapable         => 0,\n        execcapable        => 0,\n        cc_hasjit          => '',\n        TEMP_jit_o         => '',\n\nBut it's not clear how one can validate that the result will \"match ANSI characteristics.\"  Is \nthere any link we could place in the POD that would show which ANSI C characteristics we \nneed to have miniparrot match?\n\nWe could then think up some tests for that.  Thank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
