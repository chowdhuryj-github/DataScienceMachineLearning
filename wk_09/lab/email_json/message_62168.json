The random variable would be\nthe individual on which physiological variables are measured at\ndifferent time points. I have 4 time points, 5 individuals and 3\nreplicates per condition (time/individual),  and I would like to fit\na quadratic model on time. The model I am using is\n\n> mm <- lme(myvar ~ time + time2, random= ~ time|individual,\ndata=clinical)\n\nbeing time2 = time*time\n\nI have a number of questions\n\n1) I am not very sure the random effect is correctly modeled. Would I\nneed to include the time2 variable aswell?\n\n2) I would like to extract the F statistics of the model, and I do\nnot find a function for this. Is this possible?\n\n3) depending of the variable I take, I frequently obtain a\nconvergence error as a result of the lme funcion. Any ideas on what\nto do to improve convergence?\n\nThank you\n\nAna Conesa, PhD\nCentro de Investigacion Principe Felipe\nAvda.
