If you have\n\nunless ($foo) {\n    print \"false\\n\";\n}\n\nand you find you need an else you change it to an if\n\nif ($foo) {\n    print \"true\\n\"\n} else {\n    print \"false\\n\";\n}\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
