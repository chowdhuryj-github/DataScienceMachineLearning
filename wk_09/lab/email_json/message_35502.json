South Africa. May 24. 2007 \\u2013 The dire lack of health care\nworkers in southern Africa is threatening efforts to expand access to\nHIV/AIDS treatment, warned the international medical humanitarian\norganization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in a\nnew report issued today. The report covers four southern African\ncountries\\u2014Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa\\u2014where more than one\nmillion people still need life-saving antiretroviral treatment but do not\nhave access to it. Lack of action will result in unnecessary illness and\ndeath.\n\n'In Thyolo district we are treating 7,000 people with HIV/AIDS. We need to\nincrease this number to 10,000 by the end of the year, but our program is\nhitting a wall because there are simply not enough nurses, doctors, and\nmedical assistants,' said Veronica Chikafa, a nurse/matron working with\nMSF in Malawi.\n\nThe full report is available online at:\nhttp://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2007/healthcare_worker_report_05-2007.pdf\n\nSevere shortages of health staff are compromising the quality and\navailability of HIV/AIDS care across southern Africa. In Thyolo district\nin Malawi, a medical assistant can see up to 200 patients per day, far too\nmany to ensure quality care.  In Mavalane district in Mozambique, patients\nare forced to wait for up to two months to start treatment because of the\nlack of doctors and nurses, and many have died during the wait.\n\nIn Lesotho there are only 89 doctors in the whole country.  'Providing HIV\ncare in rural clinics depends on nurses, but they are overwhelmed by the\nnumber of patients,' said Dr. Pheello Lethola, field doctor for MSF in\nLesotho.  'Consultation times are too short, and sick patients suffer\nneedlessly. When nurses suffer, patients suffer.'\n\nThere is wide acknowledgement of the human resource crisis, but little\naction on the ground.  MSF is urging governments to develop and implement\nemergency plans to retain and recruit health care workers that include\nmeasures to raise pay and improve working conditions. In most countries\nthis will only happen if donors change their policies and start providing\nfinancial support for recurrent costs such as salaries. Ministries of\nfinance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will need to find\nsolutions to overcome 'caps' on the number of health workers and level of\nsalaries. Otherwise, governments will not be able to respond adequately to\nthe unmet need for treatment.\n\nEven in South Africa, which has more health care workers who are better\npaid compared to other southern African countries, unequal distribution\nand inadequate numbers of staff are causing delays to expanding treatment.\n'Clinics are absolutely saturated, waiting lists are growing, and it feels\nlike we are losing the battle,' said Dr. Eric Goemaere, head of MSF\\u2019s\nprogram in Khayelitsha, Western Cape.  'For people making policies in\noffices far away from patients, our message is that you will be held\nresponsible if you are not reactive or flexible enough to find solutions\nto the staff shortages.'\n\nTo expand access to HIV care in rural settings, MSF teams have relied on\n'task-shifting' from doctors to nurses, and from nurses to community\nworkers.  But these are limited measures that do not remove the need for\nadditional skilled staff.\n\n'It is incomprehensible that donors provide funds for life-long aids\ntreatment and the building of new clinics, but refuse support for health\ncare worker salaries on the grounds that this is unsustainable, said\nSharonann Lynch, treatment literacy coordinator for MSF in Lesotho.\n'People living with HIV/AIDS do not only need drugs and clinics; they need\ntrained, motivated health care workers to diagnose, monitor, and treat\nthem.'\n\nIn the four countries profiled in this report, MSF is presently providing\nantiretroviral treatment (ART) for nearly 30,000 people.  Worldwide, MSF\nprovides ART to over 80,000 patients in more than 30 countries.\n\nContact: Buddhima Lokuge +1-212-655-3762\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
