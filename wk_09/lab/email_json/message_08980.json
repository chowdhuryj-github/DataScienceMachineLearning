Managers use benchmarking to identify opportunities for improving either cost or quality performance. A company\u2019s Board of Directors can use benchmarking to evaluate senior management and set executive bonuses.\nBenchmarking is also increasingly used in regulation. Some alternative regulation (AltReg) plans use performance benchmarks directly and reward or penalize companies depending on their measured performance compared to established performance standards. Regulators can use benchmarking as one tool to ensure that rates are just and reasonable in a decade of rising cost pressures. For example, benchmarking can be used to assess the reasonableness of payments for customers, A&G, IT and other services provided by unregulated affiliates.\nThe rising interest in benchmarking around the world has lead to important advances in benchmarking techniques. A wide range of benchmarking methods are available, however, most studies prepared today fall far short of the best available practices.\nThis seminar is designed to give participants a solid introduction to benchmarking and its potential role in utility management and regulation. Available methods will be reviewed, and principles and precedents for using benchmarking in regulation will also be analyzed. Considerable attention will be devoted to the application of benchmarking in specific utility businesses.\nWho Should Attend\nThe seminar is designed for management and senior level utility personnel, particularly those responsible for ratemaking, regulation and corporate strategy, as well as members of State, Provincial, and Federal regulatory agencies. A detailed working knowledge of benchmarking is not necessary, although some familiarity with the concepts would be helpful. Utilities and regulators that have already utilized benchmarking are strongly urged to attend and share their views and experiences.\nWhat You Will Learn\nBenchmarking basics\n          Pros and cons of econometrics, indexing, and other benchmarking methods\n          Principles for applying external benchmarks in utility regulation\n          Key regulatory precedents\n          Benchmarking applications\n          Power generation\n          Power transmission\n          Power distribution\n          Customer services\n          A&G expenses\n          Bundled power service\n          Service quality\n          Gas distribution\n          Superior performers based on state-of-the-art research\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\n\nUpcoming \nConferences\n\n\nFundamentals \n\t\t\tof Distribution Engineering\nAtlanta, GA\n            April 19-20, 2007\n\nSox-101 for \n\t\t\tElectric, Gas and Water Utilities ...
