A San Francisco company, Cryptography Research Inc., is\n[0]designing a crypto chip to marry cartridges to printers. There's no\nword so far that any printer manufacturer has committed to using it.\nQuoting: \"The company's chips use cryptography designed to make it harder\nfor printers to use off-brand and counterfeit cartridges. CRI plans to\ncreate a secure chip that will allow only certain ink cartridges to\ncommunicate with certain printers. CRI also said that the chip will be\ndesigned that so large portions of it will have no decipherable\nstructure, a feature that would thwart someone attempting to\nreverse-engineer the chip by examining it under a microscope to determine\nhow it works. 'You can see 95 percent of the [chip's] grid and you still\ndon't know how it works,' said Kit Rodgers, CRI's vice president of\nbusiness development. Its chip generates a separate, random code for each\nink cartridge, thus requiring a would-be hacker to break every successive\ncartridge's code to make use of the cartridge.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/01/0221213\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://news.com.com/Can+cryptography+prevent+printer-ink+piracy/2100-1041_3-6193424.html?tag=news.1\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| No iPhone For 64-Bit Windows                                       |\n|   from the very-fine-print dept.                                   |\n|   posted by kdawson on Sunday July 01, @08:02 (Communications)     |\n|   http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/01/0240224        |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]Mizled writes \"After buying a new iPhone yesterday and bringing it\nhome to sync and activate it, I found out that Windows 64-bit is not\nsupported.
