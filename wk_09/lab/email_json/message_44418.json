The GdkPixbuf bindings provided\nby the RGtk2 package allow you to read both types of images. In conjunction\nwith the cairoDevice package, you could mix the image with R graphics.\n\nAnother way might be to use some Java library via rJava and use the Java\ngraphics device.\n\nMichael\n\nFrom: Prof Brian Ripley\n> Date: Sat 22 Nov 2003 - 15:23:33 EST\n>\n> \"Even easier is to convert .bmp to .pnm by an external utility.
