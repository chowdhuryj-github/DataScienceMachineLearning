But this is different from what I asked.\n\nI know how to export the R object to a MySQL table.  But what I don't know\nhow I can use R objects as variables in constructing SQLs to integrrogate\nMYSQL database.  Chris's suggestion using paste to construct is one which\nbasically export out R object as strings into SQLs then send to MYSQL. This\nis a good suggestion.  But is there any other way to do this which would\nachieve the same effect without get the variable content out as strings?\nThis would help to better integrate the code and integrate R data structure\nwith database integrrogation.\n\nThanks much for the help in advance.\n\n\nOn 6/5/07, bogdan romocea  wrote:\n>\n> With regards to your concern - export the R object to a MySQL table\n> (the RMySQL documentation tells you how), then run an inner join.
