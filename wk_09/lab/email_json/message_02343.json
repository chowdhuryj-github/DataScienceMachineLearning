Avoiding read.spss is a perfectly reasonable strategy, and is \nin fact what we have always recommended in the Data Import-Export manual.\n\nAFAIK the only commercial statistical software vendor that does provide \ncomplete, public documentation of their file formats is Stata, and this \nis one reason why there are fewer complaints about read.dta and write.dta. \nIt also probably helps that the code was written by someone who uses Stata \n-- there hasn't been much contribution of code or patches for the \nforeign package from SPSS users.\n\n\n \t-thomas\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
