The question is, if there is a significant difference in the two groups and how large the differnce is (95% confidence intervals).\n\nLet me give sample data\n# Data\nID<-factor(rep(1:50,each=5)) # 50 subjects\nGROUP<-factor(c(rep(\"Verum\", 115), rep(\"Placebo\", 135)))\nTIME<-factor(rep(paste(\"t\",0:4,sep=\"\"), 50))\nset.seed(1234)\nY<-rnorm(250)\n# to have an effect:\nY[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t1\"]<-Y[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t1\"] + 0.6 \nY[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t2\"]<-Y[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t2\"] + 0.3 \nY[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t3\"]<-Y[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t3\"] + 0.9 \nY[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t4\"]<-Y[GROUP==\"Verum\" & TIME==\"t4\"] + 0.9 \nDF<-data.frame(Y, ID, GROUP, TIME)\n\nI have heard of different ways to analyse the data\n1) Comparing the endpoint t4 between the groups (t-test), ignoring baseline\n2) Comparing the difference t4 minus t0 between the two groups (t-test)\n3) Comparing the endpoint t4 with t0 as a covariate between the groups (ANOVA - how can this model be calculated in R?)\n4) Taking a summary score (im not sure but this may be a suggestion of Altman) istead of t4\n5) ANOVA (repeated measurements) times t0 to t5, group placebo/verum), subject as random factor - interested in interaction times*groups (How to do this in R?)\n6) as 5) but times t1 to t5, ignoring baseline (How to do this in R?)\n7) as 6) but additional covariate baseline t0 (How to do this in R?)\n\nWhat will be best? - (Advantages / disadvantages?)\nHow to analyse these models in R with nested and random effects and possible covariate(ID, group - at least I think so) and random parameter ID)? Or is there a more simple possibility?\n\nPerhaps somebody can recommend a book or weblink where these different strategies of analysing are discussed - preferable with examples with raw data which I can recalculate. And if there is the R syntax includede - this would be best!\n\nAny help will be appreciate!\n\nThanks!\nKarl\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
