A new crash reporting system called\n[3]Breakpad is also now available in some Mac OS X and Windows builds but\nis not yet supported on Linux. 'Places will also be less likely to lose\ndata in the event of program or Windows crashes. In fact, according to\nConnor, \"We haven't figured out how to make Places lose data.\" For\nbackwards compatibility and manual backups, Firefox 3 will save bookmarks\nin the traditional bookmarks.htm file when it closes. For other bookmark\nupgrades, Mozilla is planning to enable bookmark tagging, and is\nconsidering building its own synchronization client into the browser\ncapable of backing up and sharing bookmarks.

Just the same, he's disappointed with the reaction they've\nreceived from the open source community. \"Feedback from the Linux\ncommunity has been on the order of 'you shouldn't really be talking to\nthe devil.'
