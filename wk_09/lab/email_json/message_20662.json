Perhaps you want to know whether a\nsubroutine needs to be declared before using it. No, not in Perl. But\nyou may do so, as you found. Your code should work the same with or\nwithout that declaration, I believe.\n\nAre you complaining that Perl is similar to C? Are you rejoicing that\nPerl is similar to C?\n\nAre you having trouble expressing your question in English? Feel free\nto ask in another language if you think that might help.\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
