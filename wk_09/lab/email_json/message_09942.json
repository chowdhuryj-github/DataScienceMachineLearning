(No, he's not biking to Honolulu, London, or Baffin Island, \nOK?) Here's all you need to know to enter Fred's contest.\nStep 1. Be a subscriber. If you're not already a subscriber to \nthe Windows Secrets Newsletter, first get a free subscription by \nusing the following link:\nGet a subscription\nStep 2. Enter to win. Any subscriber, free or paid, can use the \nfollowing link to enter the contest. Entries will be accepted Apr. 19 through 25:\n\n\u2022  Enter to win a Housecall from Fred Langa\n\nAll we ask is that you supply a reason why \nyou'd like Fred to visit you, and provide us with your general location. Fred \nhimself will make the final selection and notify the winners by May 31. We'll \nnotify everyone about the winning entries in our June 7 newsletter. Fred's \nHousecalls will occur in July and August.\nStep 3. What fine print? Like any contest, we're required to \npublish our  contest rules, so there you go. (The main restrictions are that we can't \naward any prizes to applicants who are under 18, and we can't select those who \nlive in Qu\u00e9bec, a province that requires registration and fees for contests of \nany type.)\n\nThat's it! I hope you'll enter today.\n\n\n\n\nRiding into the sunset across the continent\n\n\n\n\n\nFred and his wife, Michelle, are shown in the photo at left on one of \nhis favorite bikes. Fred will be riding in the breeze and sleeping in \ncampgrounds from New Hampshire to the West Coast to Montr\u00e9al, \nfeeling footloose and computer-free. (Michelle will be flying \nin to join Fred on occasion, but she isn't part of the Housecalls, \nsorry.)\n\nFred has been making Housecalls ever since he offered them in his LangaList newsletter on\nMay  21, 2005. One of his visits was written up \non Oct. 6, 2005.\n\nFred's forthcoming sabbatical this summer means that he won't be writing for \nWindows Secrets again \nuntil September 2007. At that time, he promises to provide us with an irregular \nseries of columns describing what he learned during his labors on behalf of the \ncontest winners. The newsletter is supporting his travels, in part, by \npaying for his screeds, which should be highly amusing.\n\nWhen I heard that Fred would go out cruising this summer, I felt a sense of loss at \nfirst. But then I realized that anyone who wrote the LangaList newsletter \nfor nine years, and then did Windows Secrets every week after our two \nnewsletters merged in 2006, deserves to get away. I hope you'll give \nyour blessing to his new adventure.\n\n\n\nEven more great content coming your way\n\n\n\nIn honor of Fred's midlife crisis, I'm promoting him to the new title of \neditor-at-large, so he can contribute whenever and wherever he likes. \nMeanwhile, the rest of us will just work that much harder to deliver \nto you our weekly jolt of tips and tricks.\n\n\nTo keep the secrets of Windows flowing, I've promoted Scott Dunn to \nthe position of associate editor. As you may recall, he wrote the \nLangaList Plus section in the paid version of the newsletter as a \ncontributing editor last November and December before taking a leave \nof absence.\n\nScott previously worked full-time as a senior editor at Adobe Systems \nand has published a monthly column in PC World tirelessly for an \nincredible 15 years. Starting next week, he'll \nbe writing our lead stories, such as his report on how to buy Windows \nsoftware at half-price that appeared in our \n\nApr. 12 issue. In addition, he'll be running a \nreader-response column to answer your questions \u2014 all in the free \nversion of the newsletter.\n\n\nTo whip our weekly content into shape, Jody Braverman has come \non board as our new managing editor. She moved to Seattle to work with \nus after three years in Shanghai, where she was managing editor \nof EuroBiz Magazine, an English-language publication on foreign business \nin China.\n\nWith her help, our scribblings will sound even gooder.\n\nWe'll still have regular columns from our contributing editors, including \nSusan Bradley, Mark Edwards, Woody Leonhard, Chris Mosby, Ryan Russell, \nand even more on the way in the paid version of the newsletter.\n\nWe're excited about the great tricks we'll be able to bring you in the \nmonths to come. First, though, be sure to use the links above to enter Fred's \ncontest and support his travels.\n\nRide safely, my friend. And watch out for bugs.\n\nBrian Livingston is editorial director of WindowsSecrets.com and the co-author of \nWindows Vista  Secrets and 10 other books.\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLANGALIST TIPS\n\n\nStop avoiding Vista \u2014 accept it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Fred Langa\nThere's some highly questionable advice about Vista out on the Web. Take it \nwith a grain of salt.\n\nYou'll get a much better idea of what Vista's really like by ignoring the most \nextreme commentaries for and against the new operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould we just forget about Vista?A Windows \nSecrets reader named Howard wrote in to ask about some advice he read on a \npopular PC tune-up Web site. The site recommended to its readers that they buy \nan XP computer, while that operating system is still available, and \"forget about \nVista.\"\n\nNo operating system is perfect. If perfection were the necessary standard for \nadopting an OS, we would all still be using the abacus. But wait! Abacus beads can \ngive you splinters, so maybe we should just use our fingers and \ntoes...\n\nVista has its warts, just like any other OS. But I'd personally have no qualms at all \nabout buying a new notebook or PC that comes with Vista preinstalled. In fact, \nthat's actually a pretty good way of avoiding the driver hassles that almost \nalways occur with a major new release of an OS. If the hardware comes with Vista \npreinstalled and ready to run, you already have the drivers you need. Once you \nhave Vista, then you can \navoid the pitfalls and maximize the positives by using the information in \nthis newsletter and in Brian's\n Windows Vista Secrets book to tune and tweak your copy of Vista.\n\nThe pros and cons of upgrading an older system to Vista are a little less clear. \nDriver hassles are more common than I thought they'd be, given Vista's long \ngestation. (What the heck were hardware makers doing all that time?) \nBut, if your PC meets the Vista compatibility recommendations, \nas shown on Microsoft's \n hardware compatibility page, you shouldn't have any problems.\n\nSo, saying \"forget about Vista\" is sensationalistic and simplistic. Of \ncourse, the appearance of Vista didn't suddenly make XP obsolete. XP remains \na mainstream operating system. If you're running a well-tuned, \nstable copy of XP and it meets your needs, there's no \nfour-alarm reason to drop everything and upgrade to Vista right away. But that's \nnot the same thing as saying we should forget about Vista completely.\n\nMake no mistake, sooner or later, Vista is in your future. All of Microsoft's \nproducts have a defined and published \n\"life cycle,\" \nand Microsoft will \"retire\" full support for XP Home and Professional on \nApr. 14, 2009. That's just two years from now.\n\nXP will continue to work after that date, of course. But you can think \nof Apr. 14, 2009, as the date when Microsoft's \nsupport attentions will turn away from XP. For the next five years thereafter \n(until 2014), online self-help for XP (e.g., the Knowledge Base) will remain \navailable. Microsoft may, if it chooses, continue to release critical \npatches and updates.\n\nBut one way or another, if you want to continue to work with a Windows \noperating system, you will have to make friends with Vista. Therefore, \nI think it's just plain bad advice \u2014 downright silly, \nin fact \u2014 to say \"forget about Vista.\" But it's also silly to \nsay, \"You're doomed unless you upgrade to Vista \nimmediately.\" Both extremes are wrong.\n\nUpgrade to Vista in the normal course of your hardware and software purchases. \nThen, with the good information provided by Brian and the contributors to this \nnewsletter, you'll be able to use Vista as safely, enjoyably, and productively \nas possible.\n\n\n\nHow to determine which cookies can be deleted\n\n\n\nIf you've poked around in your browser's settings, you've probably discovered \nan easy way to see what cookies are being stored on your system. For example, \nin IE 7, click Tools, Internet Options, then in the Browsing History section, \nclick Settings, View Files. In Firefox, it's Tools, Options, Privacy, Cookies, \nView Cookies. If you haven't done a cleanup in a while, you'll probably find \na pile of cookies waiting for you.\n\nCookies are just ASCII text files created via your browser by Web sites you \nvisit. Some cookies are very useful, storing login information for the Web sites \nyou frequent, the date of your last visit (so the site can flag newer \ninformation for you), your favorite search terms, and so on. These cookies are worth \nsaving. Other cookies really only benefit Web advertisers, and can be deleted \nwith no negative consequences to you. But how do you tell which cookies are which?\n\nBecause cookies are plain text files, they can be opened and read with Notepad. \nEven so, the data stored inside a cookie may not be very easy to figure out.\n\nThat's where a tool like Karen Kenworthy's free\nCookie \nViewer can help. Cookie Viewer works with Internet Explorer and \nFirefox cookies, and presents all of a cookie's data in a comprehensive but \neasy-to-understand way. You can see when the cookie was created, by whom, when \nit expires, and more. The program also lets you delete any cookies you don't want.\n\nFigure 1. Cookie Viewer lets you see all the data a cookie contains, so \nyou can delete the ones you don't want.\n\nFirefox users can also use any of several cookie-viewing add-ons, such as the \nfree  View Cookies download.\n\nOnce you know what cookies you want to keep, managing them becomes much simpler. \nFor example, you can mark the cookies you want to keep as read-only, \nmass-delete the rest, and then clear the preserved cookies' read-only attribute.\n\nAnother alternative is to copy the cookies you want to preserve to a safe \nplace, mass-delete the rest, and then copy the cookies back. If you have \nany skill with batch files or other \nscripting tools, you can easily automate this process.\n\nThere's also a huge number of cookie managers available for sale on the Web, but \nI've never found them particularly useful. As you can see from the above, managing \ncookies manually isn't particularly difficult. The first time you do it can \nbe somewhat time-consuming, but subsequent cleanups can be easy and \nlightning-fast.\n\n\n\nMore on accessing Device Manager\n\n\n\nThe many ways you can accomplish tasks in Windows is one of the operating \nsystem's greatest strengths and, at the same time, one of its biggest \ndrawbacks. Some see it as a weakness, because it can make \nWindows harder to learn and use. It's true that it makes our jobs at Windows \nSecrets more difficult, because it means that there are several ways of \nexplaining how to access or manipulate different features.\n\nFor example, a few readers had trouble with the how-to instructions I \ngave on Apr. 5 \nfor accessing Device Manager via Control Panel, Performance \n& Maintenance, System, Hardware, Device Manager.\n\nThe above process works for Control Panel's default Category View. But, \nif you're using the Classic View, the category headings, such as \nPerformance and Maintenance, are not shown. Instead, you simply see \na list of individual Control Panel applets. In Control Panel's Classic View, \nthe clickstream to access Device Manager would be Control Panel, System, \nHardware, Device Manager.\n\nBut that just scratches the surface of the many ways to open Device \nManager. You can also get to Device Manager by right-clicking on My \nComputer and selecting Properties from the context menu. From there, \nyou click Hardware and then Device Manager.\n\nOr, you can click Start, Run and then enter devmgmt.msc \nin the Run box. (In Vista, simply enter devmgmt.msc in the \nSearch box.\n\nOr, you can click Start, Run and then enter mmc \nto open the Microsoft Management Console. Once inside the Console, you \ncan navigate to the Console plug-ins, usually located in \n/Windows/System32. You can recognize them by the .msc \nfile extension.\n\nFor that matter, you can browse directly to the \n/Windows/System32 folder in Explorer and click on any \n.msc file to open that plug-in.\n\nOr, use Windows' Search function to find all *.msc files, then \nclick on the one you want from the search results list.\n\nThere are probably other ways to get there, too. You can see why we can't \npossibly list every way of accomplishing a task in every article \u2014 there \nisn't enough space or time!\n\nThe flexibility that Windows provides means that you can do things in the manner \nthat feels most natural to you, whether this be typed commands or \npoint-and-click navigation. This is one of the things I like most about Windows.\n\nSo, if a how-to instruction doesn't fit your situation exactly, don't \nworry. It's actually an artifact of one of Windows' most positive attributes: \nits incredible flexibility. If you don't find the exact answer you're looking \nfor here, a little spelunking in the Windows Help system or online will almost \nsurely find you a solution.\n\n\n\nHasta la vista, amigos!\n\n\n\nAs Brian explained in his introduction to this newsletter, after 30 years of tech \nwriting (and 25 years specifically and continuously in computers), it's time for me to take a \nbreak. With the approach of good weather, I'll soon be heading out on an \nextended trip around North America by motorcycle. \n\nMy wife will join me for some \nof the trip, but the rest will be solo and will include some backcountry travel \nand camping. It should be restorative, and quite an adventure. With no firm \nschedule for the trip, this will be my first time in three decades without \npublication deadlines setting the pace. I'm looking forward to seeing what that \nfeels like!\n\nAs Brian also explained, I hope to meet some of you in my travels. (Please see \nthe introduction and follow the directions to send in your name.) I'll be back in the newsletter at the end of the summer, \nand look forward to sharing my experiences with all of you. \n\nHope to see you along the way!\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nFred Langa \nis editor-at-large of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.
