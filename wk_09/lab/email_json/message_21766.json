Are there any interactive inspection tools in the current Perl6\nimplementations?  S12.pod talks about a \"methods\" method (on the\nobject returned by .HOW at least), but that doesn't seem to exist in\nPugs... I think in this stage where the impls are incomplete and\npeople are playing around with them (and looking for areas to help out\nin) it would be helpful to have a way to ask 'what can this object\ndo?' from within the interpreter.\n\n2. The question I was trying to answer by poking around: what is/will\nbe the P6 equivalent of P5's $. ?  I assume the answer is a method on\nthe filehandle object, but called what?  Should it keep the P5\nIO::Handle name (input_line_number)?  Or something else perhaps a\nlittle less unwieldy  (lineno, recno, ...)\n\nI don't see any reference to $. in the Synopses, so I assume this is\nnot yet defined.  Apologies if I just missed it.\n\n-- \nMark J. Reed \n"}
