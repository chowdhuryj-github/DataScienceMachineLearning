We'll\nadd that to the \"ToDo\" list.  The easiest interface I can picture is\nto pass a Cholesky factorization object along with the dsCMatrix\nobject that contains the new values with the old pattern.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
