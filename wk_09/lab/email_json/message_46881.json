Tonight Sharyl Attkisson will report that the President made a\n  rare visit to the Capitol to nudge GOP senators on the bill. She\u2019ll\n  also explain how members of Congress are reacting to the pressure.\n\u00a0\nAlso on Capitol Hill today, some military families\n  testified before Congress about cancer and other illnesses they blame on\n  drinking toxic tap water at their military base. Over three decades, the\n  water at Camp Lejeune contained toxins at up to 40\n  times the safety limit, federal investigators say. David Martin will have\n  details.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since the\n  allegations against Duke\u2019s lacrosse team surfaced.

You might have to wait\n  longer than expected \u2013 and retire with less money than previous\n  generations did. Nancy Cordes will look at the surprise that may be in store\n  for the aging baby boomer population.\n\u00a0\nAnd Anthony Mason will have some details on the\n  lavish perks \u2013 from stock options to bonuses \u2013 some executives\n  rake in along with their salaries.\n\u00a0\nFinally, there\u2019s a growing threat to the\n  forests of mid-Atlantic states. And even though the villain is small, the\n  damage can be enormous. Michelle Miller will have the story.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us for this and more,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
