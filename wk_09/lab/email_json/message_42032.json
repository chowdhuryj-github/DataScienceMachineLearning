Inside my package I would like to create \na S4 class which extends (adds 2 slots) another S4 class from some other package. The class\nshould be created in \"myPkg\" environment (and not global environment).\n\nUsing:\n\n\nsetClass(\"myS4class\", representation(\"otherS4class\", mydata = \"numeric\"), \nwhere = topenv())\n\nI get:\n\n\nError in assign(classMetaName(Class), def, where) :\n\n\n        cannot add bindings to a locked environment\n\n\n\n\nI understand the fact that after \"myPkg\" is loaded, its namespace is sealed, but I was hoping to find a way around it.\n\nI would appreciate any comment on this.\n\nthank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
