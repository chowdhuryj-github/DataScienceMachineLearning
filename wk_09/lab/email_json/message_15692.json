I can't seem to\nfigure out how to script R, and change the output device of hist() or plot()\nto create a .gif or .png file.  This seems like something that is probably\nreally simple, and I've just overlooked the call do do it.  Can anyone point\nme in the right direction, or maybe send a sample script?\n\nthanks,\n--Mike Huber\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
