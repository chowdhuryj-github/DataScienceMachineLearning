To install the gam library, use the following  \ncommand:\n\ninstall.packages(\"gam\", dependencies = TRUE)\n\nIt downloads and installs the gam package and all its dependencies.  \nYou can use this for installing any package you find.\n\nCheers,\nWee-Jin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
