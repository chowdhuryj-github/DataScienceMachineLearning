Hi \n      everyone, Late breaking news on Capitol Hill tonight as Congress \n      prepares to send President Bush legislation that would call for the \n      withdrawal of troops to start this October. After days of harsh words \n      between the administration and the Democratic leadership about the vote, \n      the White House remains steadfast about President Bush's plans to veto \n      this legislation. Sharyl Attkisson will report. David \n      Martin will give a Reality Check on the state of the troop surge in \n      Iraq, how it's working and where funds are needed most on the ground \n      there. Next, Bob Orr will have an update on a story he \n      broke for CBS News about the case of a man who calls himself \"The Bishop.\" \n      This morning, federal authorities arrested a man suspected of sending \n      threatening letters and two dud pipe bombs. We'll have more details on the \n      case and the arrest. When John McCain started campaigning months \n      ago for the Republican nomination, he was the presumed front-runner. Now \n      that he has trailed Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in polls, he's \n      attempting to breathe life into his campaign. Today, McCain formally \n      declared his candidacy, and Jim Axelrod will have the full story. \n      Residents of Eagle Pass, Texas, say they can't remember the last \n      time a tornado struck their area. But the one that came to town yesterday \n      was a monster - destroying two schools, killing seven people and damaging \n      more than 20 homes. Elsewhere, flooding and high winds took their toll. \n      Hari Sreenivasan will survey the damage. Ask a kid their \n      favorite food, and you're likely to hear chips, cookies or other sugar- or \n      fat-loaded snacks. What happens when a school reforms the way kids eat? \n      Nancy Cordes will show you. Finally, we'll tell you about \n      what could be a planet a lot like Earth. It seems to be roughly the same \n      temperature and size, and may even have water. The hitch: it is 120 \n      trillion miles away. Sandra Hughes will have more. I \n      hope you'll join us.
