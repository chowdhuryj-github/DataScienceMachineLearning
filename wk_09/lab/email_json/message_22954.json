However, if I want to _colour_ the interior:\n\nmap(\"worldHires\", c(\"Argentina\", \"Brazil\"), c(\"cyan\", \"green\"), fill=T)\n\nThen the colors will be assigned to the islands (Marajo in Brazil's\nNorth and Tierra del Fuego in Argentina's South) and there will be\na recycling.\n\nIs there any way to associate one color to each country?\n\nAlberto Monteiro\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
