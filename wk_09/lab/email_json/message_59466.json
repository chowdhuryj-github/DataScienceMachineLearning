Seeing that the ** quantifier is\nnot yet implemented anyway, I thought what could replace it, and the\nbest i could find was <1 .. 3>.\n\nMy rationale is this:\n\n* It looks clean.\n\n* It the chapter about Extensible metasyntax (<...>) in S05 most\nparagraphs begin by \"A leading X means yadda yadda\", where X can be:\n\n    * whitespace\n    * alphabetic character (not alphanumeric!)\n    * ? $ :: @ % { & [ + - . ! ~~\n\n... so numbers are not covered.\n\n* As a side effect, * is a shortcut for <0 .. Inf>, + is a shortcut\nfor <1 .. Inf>, ? * is a shortcut for <0 .. 1>.\n\n* The ? of non-greediness can come before the closing > - <1 .. 3 ?>\n\nAny comments?\n\n-- \nAmir Elisha Aharoni\nmy band: http://www.myspace.com/tzabari/\nmy blog: http://aharoni.wordpress.com/\n\n"}
