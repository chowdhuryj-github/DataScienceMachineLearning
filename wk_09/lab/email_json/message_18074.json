Richard Roth will have\n  more on this massive bust of terror suspects.\n\u00a0\nFormer CIA director George Tenet's memoir will be\n  released next week and it's already making a stir in Washington. Jim Axelrod will give us a\n  preview of what Tenet is likely to reveal in \"At the Center of the\n  Storm.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Senior Political Correspondent Jeff Greenfield\n  will give you an overview of last night\u2019s debate of Democratic\n  presidential hopefuls.\n\u00a0\nThere's a new gold rush in the Midwest.\n  But this time, the prized loot is not a mineral \u2014 it's a vegetable. As\n  Cynthia Bowers will report, farmers are planting record crops of corn this\n  season to keep up with the growing demand for the corn-derived fuel additive\n  ethanol. \n\u00a0\nFinally, I'll give you a look at the political\n  character of the Windy\nCity, from its earliest\n  days right up to the 2008 election. I hope you'll join me.\n\u00a0\nHave a great weekend! \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
