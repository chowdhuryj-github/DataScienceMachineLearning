Yea, I am a Bible-bigot. I follow it in all things, both great and small.\nWhat's more enchanting than the voices of young people, when you can't hear what they say?\nVigilance is the virtue of vice.\nOnly when one has lost all curiosity about the future has one reached the age to write an autobiography.\nIf a small thing has the power to make you angry, does that not indicate something about your size?\nToo often when give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.\nWe do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.\nAge is not a particularly interesting subject. Anyone can get old. All you have to do is live long enough.\nInfatuated, half through conceit, half through love of my art, I achieve the impossible working as no one else ever works.\nThe foolishness of old age does not characterize all who are old, but only the foolish.\nWhen an actor has money, he doesn't send letters, but telegrams.\nWhen you get to fifty-two food becomes more important than sex.\nAge is whatever you think it is. You are as old as you think you are.\nDogs come when they are called cats take a message and get back to you.\nAbsence of proof is not proof of absence.\nAnalyzing what you haven't got as well as what you have is a necessary ingredient of a career.\nAn aphorism can never be the whole truth it is either a half-truth or a truth-and-a-half.\nBeggars should be entirely abolished! Truly, it is annoying to give to them and annoying not to give to them.\nIf you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.\n\u00a0"}
