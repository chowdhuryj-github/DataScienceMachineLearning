I am using the ARIMA package in\nR. when I look at the model coefficients I find that that the first order\nseasonal moving average term is very close to -1(this is after first order\nseasonal differencing), I have tried to look at the literature on unit roots\netc..., however I have not been able to find a good explanation of what the\nimplications are for forecasting when using a model with a MA term close to\n-1. Does anyone have any suggestions how to deal with the described\nsituation?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSpencer Jones\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
