{"category": "ham", "to_address": "Perl Beginners <beginners@perl.org>", "from_address": "Mathew Snyder <theillien@yahoo.com>", "subject": "Text Formatters", "body": "Hello all.\n\nQuestion regarding the text formatting modules out there.  I've found three on\nCPAN that seem to have the functionality that I'm looking for but I don't know\nwhich would best suit my needs.  The three are Text::Format, Text::Wrapper and\nText::Autoformat.\n\nI have a script which populates and email with data that gets laid out in the\nfollowing manner:\n\ncustomer_name\n Ticket ID                      Subject                     hh:mm\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n    ######  Random Ticket Subject Line                      ##:##\n\nHowever, the subject length is not a constant.  It can be quite short (maybe a\nfew characters long) to much longer than the alloted space I've given using\n'printf'.  So, I'd like to be able to do things like wrap the text at a certain\nlength so that it might look something like this:\n\ncustomer_name\n Ticket ID                      Subject                     hh:mm\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n    ######  Random Ticket Subject Line Which Might End Up   ##:##\n            Longer Than The Allocated Space Using printf\n    ######  Next Random Ticket Subject Line                 ##:##\n\nOf the three formatting options I've found, which might be my best bet to handle\nsomething of this nature.  Also, after deciding which is the better option, how\nwould I go about printing the data out?  Can I populate variables with\npre-formatted text or would I perhaps do something with a printf command that\nuses a call to one of the formatting methods?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\nMathew\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
