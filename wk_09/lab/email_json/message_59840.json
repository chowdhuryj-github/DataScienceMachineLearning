Right now, really only way to save a \nconsole section, would be inserting in an editor.  Looks like insert 7 is free, \nmaybe have insert 7 as global-and-keep insert 8 as individual.\nThanks in advance for considering these suggestions\nHart\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
