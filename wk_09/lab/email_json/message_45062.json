This apparently causes the \nresults to conform to some type of extreme value distribution, so \nWeibull is a reasonable starting point for exploration.\n\nI have tried ('surface' and 'team' are factors)\n\nglm(surfcount ~ surface*team, data=powderd, family=Gamma(link='log'))\n\nbut this doesn't quite do the trick. The standardized deviance \nresiduals are still curved away from normal at the tails.\n\nThanks for any info you can give on this nonstandard model.\n================================================================\nRobert A.
