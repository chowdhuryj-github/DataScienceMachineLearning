We contacted you because you bear the same surname identity with the deceased and therefore can present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance.\n\u00a0\nWe therefore reckoned that you can receive these funds as you are qualified by your name identity. All the legal papers will be processed on your acceptance. If you accept this deal, we request that you kindly forward to us your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable us file necessary documents at our high court probate division for the release of this sum of money.\n\u00a0\nYours faithfully,\n\u00a0\nHugo Deryuk.Explore the seven wonders of the world Learn more!\n"}
