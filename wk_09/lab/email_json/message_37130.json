It roughly looks like [(3,\n':1.abcdef'), (5, ':1.ghijkl')]\n\nI will use such dbus addresses to send messages to one particular\nrecipient on a tube.\n\nHowever, when a Buddy joins my activty, and the 'buddy-joined' callback\nis fired, I have a buddy object () with a really tiny public API it seems. \nSaid API does not allow me to retrieve dbus addresses that I need (there\nis a GetTelepathyHandles function in sugar/services/presence/buddy.py\nthough which may or may not do what I want).\n\nAny pointers on the proper solution would be appreciated.\n\nCheers!\n  Marc\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
