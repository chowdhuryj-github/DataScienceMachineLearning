Where is it being\nplanned, if not on this list?\n\nAlso, why are we hoping that it will be \"done right\"?  Given the history\nof things like this it strikes me as unlikely that now is the particular\nmoment where we suddenly manage to create a perfect library, and as such\nthis would be hoping against the light of available evidence!\n\nIt seems entirely possible that during Perl 6's life somebody, possibly\nsomebody who at the moment hasn't even heard of Perl 6, will create a\nbetter web module.  It would be good if at that point it becomes\nstraightforward for it to get acceptance and people to adopt it.\n\nSmylers\n\n"}
