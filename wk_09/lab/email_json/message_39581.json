Where are you setting '&delete_posterfile'; and to what are you setting it?\n\n2. IIRC, following a sub declaration with empty parentheses tells the\ncompiler that that sub doesn't take any parameters.  Within the scope\nof the delete_file sub, @_ is set to '()'; so shifting or assigning\nfrom @_ to a list will always result in null assignments.  Try\nremoving the '()' from the sub declaration lines.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
