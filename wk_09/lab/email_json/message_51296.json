If it is genuine new random data then no.\n\nIf it is fixed length then you can calculate the position and then do a\nseek to the position.  (record length +1) * record number (+2 for cr lf\nline endings).\n\nYou can index before hand.  For example I have a sort process that reads\nthe file,  does a tell for the position of the records,  the index is\nthen manipulated and I can read the records in new order by doing a\nseek.\n\n-- \nKen Foskey\nFOSS developer\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
