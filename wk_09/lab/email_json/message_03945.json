And (I think) I know how to create a method for \"alpha\", such as\n\"summary.alpha\", \"plot.alpha\". The problem is, when I try to access \"alpha\"\nobject by usual data.frame method, it won't.\n\nFor example, suppose X is an object of class \"alpha\". Then, the commands\nsuch as dim(X), X[1,1], none of these works. \n\nI want to know how to define a class so that when there is appropriate\nmethods use it, but when there's not use the predetermined method for\nunderlying object. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks-\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/class-and-method-tf3568696.html#a9969691\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
