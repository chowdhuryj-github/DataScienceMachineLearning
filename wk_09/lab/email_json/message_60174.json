I would like to know whether R has the possibility of combining \nthese into a single 'report' or output. An example of a program that \ndoes this is SPSS. After running the analysis you have a combination of \ntextual output (tables) and plots that are easy to print and distribute.\n\nI know of the possibility to embed R code into LATEX (using Sweave), but \nI wouldn't call this quick since a lot of coding will go into writing \nthe Sweave file.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nRegards,\nDieter\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
