It works out to the same thing, but it isn't CSV's fault.\nFor an example of a programmer using a CSV-like format where he/she\nshould be using the real thing look at my other post on this thread.\nMy code fails to handle escaped double quotes correctly.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
