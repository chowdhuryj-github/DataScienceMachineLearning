I'm having a hard time finding something  \nthat makes the statement that clearly.\n\nI'm trying to parse out email content and it seems reasonable that I  \ncould get characters in just about any conceivable format, from  \nascii, latin, utf...\n\nFor simplicity I'm leaning in a direction of just converting everying  \n\"up\" to UTF8 and working all my string/regex manipulations on UTF.\n\nSo I'm trying to see if I can just use /(\\w+)/ without worrying about  \nall this character encoding?\nOr do I have to first Encode everything into UTF8?\nAnd if so, before I Encode it, do I have to figure out what it is  \nfirst and then convert it from whatever encoding it is to UTF8?\n\nFor simplicity, it isn't necessarily a requirement that I can parse  \nthe content into perfectly accurate words, but they have to be  \ncompletely repeatable and preferable fast.\n\nhelp?\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
