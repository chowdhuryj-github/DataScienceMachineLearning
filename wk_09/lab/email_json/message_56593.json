It didn't give any output, but when I redirected the output to VIM it \nreported the error line as\n\n^Z at ../bin/walon line 25\n\nIt looks like Tie::Handle::CSV just dies when there are no records left.\n\nI've looked at the perldoc for the module and I can't see any reference to why \nit should do this, or how to stop it.\n\n-- \nGary Stainburn\n \nThis email does not contain private or confidential material as it\nmay be snooped on by interested government parties for unknown\nand undisclosed purposes - Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, 2000     \n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
