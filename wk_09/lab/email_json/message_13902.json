There\nare two factors in my fixed effect model, educ (treatment and control) and\nmth (visit 1, 2, and 3). What I want to obtain is the estimated treatment\ndifference (treatment - control) at visit 3, plus the standard error and\np-value. This can be easily obtained in SAS using lsmeans or estimate\nstatements, but I am not sure how to do this in R. \n\n \n\nThe fixed effects I obtained are as follows:\n\n \n\nFixed effects: ymth ~ educ * mth - 1 \n\n                                    Value               Std.Error\nDF        t-value               p-value\n\neduccont                       0.14814308       0.006232419      93\n23.769758         0.0000\n\neductreat                       0.13696952       0.006255672      93\n21.895254         0.0000\n\nmthymth2                      0.00003759       0.006333043      165\n0.005936           0.9953\n\nmthymth3                      0.01075489       0.006251328      165\n1.720416           0.0872\n\neductreat:mthymth2       0.00323847       0.008947291      165\n0.361950           0.7179\n\neductreat:mthymth3       -0.01246565      0.008941306      165\n-1.394164          0.1651\n\n \n\n \n\nThe estimated treatment difference I am interested are:\n\n \n\n a<-0.14814308+0.01075489 \n\n b<-0.13696952+0.01075489-0.01246565\n\n> b-a\n\n[1] -0.02363921   (treatment effect at visit 3, same as SAS lsmean output)\n\n \n\nBut I don't know how to get the standard error and corresponding p-value for\nthis estimate. Any of your helps on that would be greatly appreciated!\n\n \n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nYannan\n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
