I want to use replacement (so that the \nsame number could potentially be picked more than once).\n\nI have read the R-help archives and the statistics and computing book on modern \nApplied statistics with S but the advice seems to be for much form complicated \nexamples, there must be a simpler way for what I am trying to do?\n\nIf anybody can help me I would greatly appreciate your advice and time,\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJenny\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJennifer Barnes\nPhD student: long range drought prediction \nClimate Extremes Group\nDepartment of Space and Climate Physics\nUniversity College London\nHolmbury St Mary \nDorking, Surrey, RH5 6NT\nWeb: http://climate.mssl.ucl.ac.uk\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
