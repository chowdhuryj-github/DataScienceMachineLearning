Ran into a problem with this where the log file showed\nthat we were sending only enctypes 5 and 16 (I believe I'm remembering\ncorrectly), and these weren't getting decrypted; we needed to specify\ndefault enctypes in the /etc/krb5.conf file to get it working, but had\nto drop back to a previous version to do this, because I couldn't find\nany way to force the enctypes in the 'private' krb5.conf file that samba\nwas using, and it got auto regenerated each time we tried the join.\nAny way to force enctypes in the autogenerated krb5.conf file that you\nknow of???\nDon\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Don McCall [mailto:donmccall1@yahoo.com] \nSent: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 5:08 PM\nTo: McCall, Don (GSE-WTEC-Alpharetta)\nSubject: Fw: [Samba] Restricting to a subset of the domain controllers\non a site\n\n----- Forwarded Message ----\nFrom: Gerald (Jerry) Carter \nTo: Wayne Rasmussen \nCc: samba@lists.samba.org\nSent: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 2:43:27 PM\nSubject: Re: [Samba] Restricting to a subset of the domain controllers\non a site\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nWayne Rasmussen wrote:\n\n> Is there any settings in smb.conf file which are \n> required for this?\n\nNope.  Just coded internally to the DC lookup routines\nused by smbd and winbindd.  Also generates private\nkrb5.conf files used to enforce server affinity\nat the krb5 clientlib layer.\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXcXPIR7qMdg1EfYRAn98AKCXfsKdmJ4FVd1sjXcXfbpDKhIrwgCfarKb\n44oHaen3JYAcyll7vn+Tcho=\n=0YCi\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n-- \nTo unsubscribe from this list go to the following URL and read the\ninstructions:  https://lists.samba.org/mailman/listinfo/samba\n\n\n       \n________________________________________________________________________\n____________Be a better Globetrotter.
