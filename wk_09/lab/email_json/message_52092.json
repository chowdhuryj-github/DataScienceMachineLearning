I reviewed A.9 and found that I simply needed to set:\n\n<< results=tex, echo=false >>=\n\nin the initial function call. Then the route I was pursuing worked smashingly.\n\nThe rest of your post has me thinking about my approach. I have more\nthan enough data, in my mind at least, to justify the extra effort\n(and possible confusion) of including captions. I'll need to look at\nthe options for the \"pdf\" function to see if it already has the\nfunctionality I am looking for.\n\nThank you very much for the nice reply to my post!\n\nMatt\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
