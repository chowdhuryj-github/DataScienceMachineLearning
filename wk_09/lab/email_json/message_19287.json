We thought it was PCMCIA problem an started without it, but it\nstill is slow from around the place that PCMCIA would have started.\nAlso the X11 is very sluggish. The laptop is noticeably slower than\nother older desktop computers. \n\nDoes anybody have any experience with this? We are looking for clue as\nto what makes this happen. Windows XP does not have a boot problem.\n\nAny hints much appreciated!\n\nPreben\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
