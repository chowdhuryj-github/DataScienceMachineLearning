If SAS were the only approved product, Bayesian trials would\nbe in real trouble.\n\nCody Hamilton, PhD\nStaff Biostatistician\nEdwards Lifesciences\n\nDisclaimer:  As always, I am speaking for myself and not necessarily for\nEdwards lifesciences.\n\nOne closing comment:  There is increasing use of R within the FDA itself\nand this will only further help to assuage the fears of prospective\nusers over time.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarc Schwartz\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
