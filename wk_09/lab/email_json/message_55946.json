Hence I need to\nconvert the data to counting process notation. survSplit and the like do\na nice job of doing this for a single event variable - is there anything\nthat can do it for 2 or more events? Can survSplit be adapted or is\nthere another way (which saves me having to write my own code)?\n\nCheers\n\nScott\n\n_____________________________\n\n \nScott Williams MD\n\nPeter MacCallum Cancer Centre\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
