A\nsearch for this problem on that forum turns up lots of hits. I think\neveryone is having these problems (which makes me pause about whether\nto switch to Mac, given how much I use R). Below is a message from the\nr-sig-mac forum from R/Mac guru Simon Urbanek:\n\n\nSimon Urbanek  to Byron, r-sig-mac\n show details  9:53 am (6 hours ago)\n\n\nOn Apr 19, 2007, at 5:47 AM, Byron Ellis wrote:\n\n> Actually it appears that a variety of packages are doing this\n> (gtools did it to me earlier today).

Unfortunately this seems to have influenced the\n2.4 builds process. A hot fix is to install gcc4.0.3 from the full\nimage of R 2.4.1 (open the installation image, click on \"Packages\"\nand then \"gcc4.0.3\" to install) or to use R 2.5.0 RC instead. I'll\nsee if I can find the culprit in the meantime...\n\n\nOn 4/18/07, Gregory Warnes  wrote:\n> I have received a number of reports of problems with recent unversal\n> Mac packages from CRAN when used with R 2.4.1.
