Now, I am to the point of installing \nsoftware speech.  Speech-Dispatcher is installed, as is Speechd-Up.  Espeak \nis my synth of choice.  I also setup my kernel to compile sftsyn as a \nmodule.  In the default synth field in the kernel, though, I have ltlk as \nthat is my primary synth.  I have verified that Speech-Dispatcher and \nSpeechd-up are working because I performed the speechd-up probe test and it \nwas spoken.  The problem happens when I do modprobe speakup_sftsyn.  The \nsystem simply freezes; no speech, no beeps, nothing.  In fact, I'm forced to \nrestart forcefully with the ower button.  Where should I look to find \nwhatever error may be occurring?  If I need to get sighted assistance, \nthat's not a problem.\n\nThanks,\nRobby \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
