I find that I can get pretty fine-grained control over what\nparts of a project need to be rerun by breaking the analysis into\nchapters.  I suppose it depends on whether one takes a script-centric\nor an object-centric view of a data analysis project.  A script-centric\nview is nicer for version control.  I think that make is\ncentric-neutral :).\n\nCheers,\n\nAndrew\n\nOn Tue, Apr 10, 2007 at 04:23:54PM -0700, Taylor, Z Todd wrote:\n> On Monday, April 09, 2007 3:23 PM, someone named Wilfred wrote:\n> \n> > So what's the big deal about S using files instead of memory\n> > like R.
