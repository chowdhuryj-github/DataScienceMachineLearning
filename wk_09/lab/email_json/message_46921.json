I get great results from\nboth, when compressing track exports for other collaborators.  FLAC makes\nmost sense for a web site wanting to cater for all, thanks for helping clear\nthat up.\n\nI didn't get chance until now to also backup Drew's interesting idea of\nsharing a \"project\" file.  The only trouble with this is that you'd need to\nmake sure folks all had the same software, and be careful not to use any\nhardware specific plugins (DSP audio card processing etc).  As Drew said, a\nlive (RT kernel) linux distro (with disk writing support) could provide an\ninteresting platform from which to launch such a project.\n\nThis is getting a little OT, but I wonder if anyone else onlist feels it may\nmake an interesting CC promo project if we (as a group) teamed up with a\ndistro like UbuntuStudio or Dynebolic (both of which offer a good range of\napps) to start some sort of community open-audio project, \"open\" from the\n\"tools up\" ??\n\n;)\n\nKev\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Evan Prodromou\" \nTo: \nSent: Tuesday, June 12, 2007 5:11 PM\nSubject: Re: [cc-community] Strayform - where artists and fansconnect tofund\nand distribute new creative works\n\n\n>> My suggestion would be to forget about CD audio, that's replaced\neffectively\n>> by the lossless codecs like flac and ape (which you should prefer btw).\n\nI like FLAC, but it seems like APE is a proprietary, single-platform\nformat.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey%27s_Audio\nI think open formats are best for open content.\n-Evan\n\n> _______________________________________________\n> cc-community mailing list\n> cc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\n> http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n>\n\n_______________________________________________\ncc-community mailing list\ncc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
