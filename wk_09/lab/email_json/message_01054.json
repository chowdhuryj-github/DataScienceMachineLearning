(Jeremy can you refresh my memory here on the details?)\n\nSo I'm proposing that we start using this as an incentive to get\npeople off of security = share.  We can work around some of the\nbugs but it appears probably not all and IMO we have more important\nwork to do anyways.\n\nIf anyone wants to be the official \"security = share & Vista\"\nsupport developer, I'll be glad to drop the proposal and point\nall the relevant samba@samba.org email to you :-)  Anyone?  Anyone?\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n- --\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGGr8uIR7qMdg1EfYRAvlfAKCjLucrAt6E7/VF1eccy0SOIgqP1QCaA0la\n5vuSazAimdzxVafJtdDhE/w=\n=M3E/\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
