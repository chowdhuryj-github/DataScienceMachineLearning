It is approx. 160,000 residual estimates from \nmeshes modelling the brain surfaces of 50 subjects (25 patients). \nshapiro.test only works with at most 5000 points. Are there issues with \nvery large samples sizes that I should be aware of?\n\nCheers,\n\n-Morgan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
