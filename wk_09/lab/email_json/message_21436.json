However, I get the impression that you want an annual \ncycle. If this is the case, it is probably best to go to the underlying \nfunction, radial.plot. Here is an example with some imaginary tides.\n\nlowtide<-sin(seq(1:12)+sin(seq(1,24,by=2)/10))\nlowtide<-rescale(lowtide,c(0,2355))\nmonth.abbr<-c(\"jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\n  \"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\")\nradial.plot(lowtide,labels=month.abbr,rp.type=\"s\")\n\nThis plots time of lowest tide in a month as a symbol at a radial \ndistance proportional to the 24 hour time of day. As you can see from \nrunning the example, the months of the year are displayed around the \ncircumference of the plot. One annoyance is that the hours are displayed \nas 0-2500. As \"pretty\" handles that, you would have to set \nshow.radial.grid to FALSE and manually draw the desired grid (a pain, \nbut not impossible).\n\nYou could also place the symbols at the position in the month of the \nlowest tide by specifying radial.pos instead of letting the function \nspread them out evenly.\n\nIf you want to overlay a number of years, x should be a matrix and \npoint.col can be chosen so that each year has a different color.\n\nI would like to know of any deficiencies in the docs, as while I think I \nknow what I'm talking about, it is you out there who have to understand it.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
