The online MySQL documentation is\nextensive, but the most commonly needed nuggets are buried in its\nnecessarily exhaustive contents. Third-party MySQL reference books can\nwinnow out some of the rarely-used minutia, but they still encompass\nhundreds of pages, reflecting the complexity of the subject. For quickly\nlooking up the most frequently used command syntax and other details, a\nMySQL user would usually be best served by a much more compact book, such\nas MySQL Pocket Reference.\" Read below for the rest of Michael's review.\n\nThis story continues at:\n    http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/09/1447220\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/09/1447220\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.ross.ws/\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Birthplace of Silicon Valley in Shambles                           |\n|   from the preserving-the-past dept.                               |\n|   posted by samzenpus on Monday April 09, @16:31 (IT)              |\n|   http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/09/1754233           |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nCowTipperGore writes \"Founded by William Shockley in the mid-50s,\n[0]Shockley Semiconductor Lab is generally credited with starting the\nSilicon Valley boom. When he was unable to lure his former Bell Labs\ncoworkers to join him, he filled his ranks with the best and brightest\nengineering school grads, including Zombie Moore and others who later\nwent on to form Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel. The building at 391\nSan Antonio Road, Mountain View, California, is the original site of the\ncompany but, unlike the [1]HP Garage, this building has received little\nprotection or preservation.
