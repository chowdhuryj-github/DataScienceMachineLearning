That was using\nspeech-dispatcher 0.6.1, and I haven't noticed this since moving to\n0.6.2, was this problem solved, or could it still be a potential\nproblem? I ask this as (typically) when I set debugging on (using\n0.6.1), it took some time before I actually got a crash.\n\nFrom\nMichael Whapples\nOn Sun, 2007-06-03 at 18:49 +0200, Hynek Hanke wrote:\n> >sorry to say that I experienced a crash of SD again.
