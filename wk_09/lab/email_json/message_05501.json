Mission accomplished.\n\nAll in all, this looks like a reasonable approach to me and i don't\nthink that CPANPLUS can be accused of lying.\n\nJust my 2 cents worth,\n\nAndreas Puerzer\n\n-- \nHave Fun,\nand if you can't have fun,\nhave someone else's fun.\n\t\tThe Beautiful South\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
