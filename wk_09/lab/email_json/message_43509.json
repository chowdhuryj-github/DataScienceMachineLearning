When you say\n\n    use Calculator;\n\nyou do\n\n    BEGIN {\n         require Calculator; # which loads Calculator.pm\n         Calculator->import; # if the Calculator package has an import sub\n    }\n\nThe &add sub is exported by the calc package, which inherited the\nimport from Exporter to get these exporting abilities. But this import\nwas never called.\n\n      require Calculator;\n      calc->import;\n\nwould work. But what you probably want is to use\n\n      package Calculator; # in your Calculator.pm file\n\nCheers,\nAdriano Ferreira\n\nP.S. As a stylistical note, usually you provide exporting capabilities\nto a module via Exporter with code like that:\n\n       require Exporter; # no need to use\n       our @ISA qw(Exporter);\n\nor\n\n        use base qw(Exporter);\n\n>\n> --\n> To unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\n> For additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\n> http://learn.perl.org/\n>\n>\n>\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
