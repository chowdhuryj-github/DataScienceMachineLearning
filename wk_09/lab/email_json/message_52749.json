The penalties for the marginal smooths can shrink terms to zero, \nand this gets inherited by the tensor product penalties. So, with high enough \nsmoothing parameters, the term will be shrunk to zero (and hence have zero \nEDF).\n\nSimon\n\n> Simon Wood, Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY UK\n> +44 1225 386603  www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~sw283\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
