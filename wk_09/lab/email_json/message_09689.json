Hostile people live in a hostile world. Same world.\n\nNothing happens to any man that he is not formed by nature to bear.\n\nI have an existential map it has you are here written all over it.\n\nSentiment is the ripened fruit of fantasy.\n\nHe who waits to do a great deal of good at once, will never do anything.\n\nFamiliarity breeds contempt.\n\nThe person lives twice who lives the first life well.\n\nExample is not the main thing in influencing others.
