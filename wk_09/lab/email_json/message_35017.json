Neither does Nvidia's proprietary driver, so i had\nto use vesa driver. (at the time of writing!)\n\nNote 2:\nThe ipw3945 module refused to load with this 3945 card.\n\n\nHints for buyers:\n- Check wether the nvidia or the intel 965 is properly supported (when\nyou read this)\n- Check wireless compatibility (again, when you read this).\n\nMy installation notes are available at :\nhttp://www.klabs.be/~fpiat/linux/debian/Etch_on_Thinkpad_T61.html\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
