I tend to give each project a directory of its own and set\nthe working directory to that.\nSince there are several tasks that\nneed to be accomplished in many of my projects, I frequently want to\nuse functions I have written previously. My question is, how do I get\naccess to them? The way I do it now is copy the relevant code to the\nscript file of the project I am working on at the time and then run it\nso as to make the functions available. But that seems to be\nunnecessarily cumbersome. I used to work a lot with gauss, which had\nthe opportunity of putting one's own functions is one directory and\ngauss would then have that directory in its search path always. How can\nI access my own functions in R without having to copy-paste them\neverytime and run them manually so I can call them later? Do I need to\nlearn how to write a package and attach the package to make the\nfunctions available at all times? Is there another way?\n\nthanks, James\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
