Going into today's EVA, 48 U.S. astronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and four astronauts representing Japan, Germany, France and Sweden had logged 530 hours and 34 minutes of EVA time building and maintaining the space station. The three previous shuttle EVAs by Forrester, Swanson, Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas total 21 hours and 29 minutes.\n\nThe primary goal of today's spacewalk is to finish activating a solar array rotary joint on the newly installed S3 truss to permit the outboard right-side S4 arrays to track the sun. The astronauts also plan to carry out a variety of other station assembly tasks. See the 8:39 a.m. status report for complete details.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
