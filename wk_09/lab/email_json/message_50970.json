forget the chart patterns, JUST LOOK at the buying pressure and the selling pressure!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding Fibonacci\nIf you\u2019ve seen The Da Vinci Code, you\u2019ve heard of the Fibonacci sequence.\u00a0  And those of you who\u2019ve been reading Trade Talk for a while might remember our explanation of this curious series of numbers.\u00a0  For the rest, let\u2019s review.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is used in many fields, including trading.\u00a0  Its name comes from an Italian mathematician, Leonardo of Pisa, son of Bonacci\u2014in Latin, filius Bonacci, or simply Fibonacci.\u00a0  Fibonacci helped popularize both this sequence and the superiority of Hindu-Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) over Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.) in the early 13th Century.\nThe Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.\u00a0  After that, every number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two.\u00a0  So, since 0 + 1 = 1, the next number is 1, giving us 0, 1, 1.\u00a0  Since 1 + 1 = 2, the next number is 2, giving us 0, 1, 1, 2.\u00a0  Can you guess the next number?\u00a0  That\u2019s right\u2014it\u2019s 3.\u00a0  Continue the pattern, and you get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on to infinity.\u00a0  Interestingly, the higher you go in the sequence, the closer the ratio between each pair of consecutive numbers gets to the Golden Mean, or 0.618.\u00a0  People of various cultures, from the ancient Greeks and Romans to stock market analysts today, have believed for millennia that this ratio occurs again and again in nature and human behavior.\nIn modern trading, we can apply this to identify retracement levels useful for setting target prices, stop losses, and strategic points to place trades.\u00a0  For instance, in a strong trend, the minimum retracement level is generally anywhere from 38.2% (1 \u2212 0.618 = 0.382) to 61.8% (0.618).\u00a0  The difference between 61.8% and 38.2% is 23.6%, and the median point between them is 50%.\u00a0\nTogether, these four numbers (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%) represent the key Fibonacci ratios used in trading.\u00a0  If you take a stock chart and draw a line at each level relative to a stock\u2019s highest and lowest price over a given period, you\u2019ll have a better idea of where the price might find support or resistance in a retracement before it continues its trend.\nAs you can see, we have a lot to thank Fibonacci for.\u00a0  After all, just think how difficult trading would be if we measured stock prices in Roman numerals: \u201cThe closing price of GSS yesterday was III dollars and LXXXI cents.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAs bullish as the three-day rally was late last week, why would the VXN have closed so bullishly on Friday?\u00a0  Let me repeat: If everything was UP, why would the VXN continue to go UP as well?\nThe fact is that we are back to the same levels of support that were reached toward the middle to the end of February \u2014 just before we had the big correction at the end of February/beginning of March.\u00a0  (If this isn\u2019t ringing any alarm bells in your head, it should!)\nAnyone for a \u201cLoser\u201d Stock?\nFewer and fewer stocks continue to make new highs.\u00a0  The rally movement has been increasingly selective and that is why it is so much easier right now to buy a loser than it is to buy a winner.\nI\u2019m not in the business of recommending losers.\u00a0  That\u2019s why I have to suggest my valued subscribers get back into the market.\u00a0  It\u2019s simply not safe right now.\nAnd don\u2019t go pegging me as a conservative or cautious investor.\u00a0  I assure you, I am not.\u00a0  It\u2019s just not the time to throw caution to the wind \u2014 unless of course you have money to burn.\u00a0  Because no matter what you see on the index right now, the internals are no different than what we saw a week ago, a month ago or six weeks ago.\nSurface health may continue to appear vibrant but now you know what is really happening inside.\u00a0  If you want to take an even deeper look around, I invite you to join me at Trending123 right now.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\nP.S.
