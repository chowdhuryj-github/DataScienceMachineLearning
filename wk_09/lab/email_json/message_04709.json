The GFDL, like every copyleft license I know of, applies  \nits obligation to license beyond the original work only if there is a  \n\"modification.\" It, more over, explicitly permits items to be mixed  \nwithout the copyleft component being applied to the other works. A  \nphotographer concerned that the copyleft rules of the BY-SA don't  \nobligate enough won't get additional obligations from the GFDL.\n\nThis is indeed why, e.g., Erik, is thinking about a clever  \nmodification to the BY-SA scope to apply the obligation beyond  \nderivatives. But until such modifications are added, either to the CC  \nlicenses or the GFDL, copyleft licenses will raise this important  \nissue for photographers, and other authors too.\nOn Apr 12, 2007, at 1:23 PM, Benj.
