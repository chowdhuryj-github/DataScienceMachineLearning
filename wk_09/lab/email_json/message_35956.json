Rather than make a\nconnection to IPC$, then connect the pipes to it, we instead have the\nlsa and samr pipes as 'secondary connections'.\n\nAndrew Bartlett\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_cmd_list_trustdom.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_cmd_lookupname.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_cmd_lookupsid.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_connect_lsa.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_connect_sam.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_init_domain.c\n   branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/winbind/wb_server.h\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (1019 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23133\n\n"}
