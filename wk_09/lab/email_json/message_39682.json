I would suggest reading the following\nbooks to learn Perl and to only use random tutorials on the Internet\nas starting points to learn more by reading perldoc.\n\n1.  The Llama --  Learning Perl (read cover to cover)\n2.  The Staghound? -- Perl Best Practices (read cover to cover)\n3.  The Camel -- Programming Perl (read cover to cover eventually, but\nfocus on areas where you have questions)\n4.  The Panther -- Advanced Perl Programming (read cover to cover)\n\nAll told that is about $169.80 plus tax.  Of course, since they are\nall O'Reilly books, you can just sign up for Safari Books for about\n$20 a month and read them online.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
