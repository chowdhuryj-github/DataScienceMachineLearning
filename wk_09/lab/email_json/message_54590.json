It is normally set to \"\\n\" (which is why\nthe <> operator reads line by line), bit it looks like, given your\ndata, you should set it to \"\\n\\n\".  That will get you a record at a\ntime.  The other issue is slightly more tricky.  If you didn't have\nthat multiline field you could have easily use two spilts (one to\nbreak the record in to fields and the other to fields into key and\nvalue pairs).  I would suggest splitting each record on \"\\n\", looping\nover the results checking to see if the first character is a space,\nand appending that line to the last field if it is or creating a new\nkey/value pair if it isn't.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
