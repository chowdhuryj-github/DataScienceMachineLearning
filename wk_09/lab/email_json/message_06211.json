The idea is to use this everywhere that we\n+  get the \"discarding const\" warning from gcc. That doesn't actually\n+  fix the problem of course, but it means that when we do get to\n+  cleaning them up we can do it by searching the code for\n+  discard_const.\n+\n+  It also means that other error types aren't as swamped by the noise\n+  of hundreds of const warnings, so we are more likely to notice when\n+  we get new errors.\n+\n+  Please only add more uses of this macro when you find it\n+  _really_ hard to fix const warnings. Our aim is to eventually use\n+  this function in only a very few places.\n+\n+  Also, please call this via the discard_const_p() macro interface, as that\n+  makes the return type safe.\n+*/\n+#define discard_const(ptr) ((void *)((intptr_t)(ptr)))\n+\n+/** Type-safe version of discard_const */\n+#define discard_const_p(type, ptr) ((type *)discard_const(ptr))\n+\n #ifndef HAVE_STRERROR\n extern char *sys_errlist[];\n #define strerror(i) sys_errlist[i]\n\nModified: branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/lib/replace/strptime.c\n===================================================================\n--- branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/lib/replace/strptime.c\t2007-04-15 21:13:48 UTC (rev 22227)\n+++ branches/SAMBA_3_0_25/source/lib/replace/strptime.c\t2007-04-15 21:14:03 UTC (rev 22228)\n@@ -974,7 +974,7 @@\n   if (want_xday && !have_yday)\n     day_of_the_year (tm);\n \n-  return (char *) rp;\n+  return discard_const_p(char, rp);\n }\n \n \n\n"}
