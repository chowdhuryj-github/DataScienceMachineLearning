If there's no lexical (\"my\") variable of the given name, the\nformat uses the global of the same name.\n\nThat doesn't seem especially likely with the given source code,\nthough. Have you tried using the debugger? And you are using both\n\"strict\" and \"warnings\"?\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
