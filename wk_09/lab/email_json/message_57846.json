It's not so much of an issue for NSIS as\nit's more flexible, but I think it's just default settings designed\nfor proprietary software.\n\nI suppose you could bypass the license acceptance step by running the\nsetup program with /q switches (i.e. silent mode install) if you\nreally wanted to.\n\n-- \nAndrew Donnellan <><\najdlinuxATgmailDOTcom (primary)    ajdlinuxATexemailDOTcomDOTau (secure)\n     http://andrewdonnellan.com    http://ajdlinux.wordpress.com\n         ajdlinux@jabber.org.au    hkp://subkeys.pgp.net 0x5D4C0C58\n            http://linux.org.au    http://debian.org\n        Spammers only === ajdspambucket@exemail.com.au ===\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
