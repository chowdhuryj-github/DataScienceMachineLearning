The only problem is\nthat R imports only a 1000 observations, is that normal? Or\ndid I have to specify an option?\n\nthanks and have a nice day\n\nAnna\n\n----- Original Message -----\nDa : \"Daniel Nordlund\" \nA : , \nOggetto : RE: [R] importing sas datasets\nData : Mon, 23 Apr 2007 13:09:47 -0700\n\n> Anna,\n> \n> My comment about var=(\"  \")  being the problem is probably\n> wrong.
