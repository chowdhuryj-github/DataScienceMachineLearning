So, the LS estimate for \\beta is given by just deconvolving Y with the inverse of X, and can be done using 1-d discrete convolution.\n\nNow, suppose that I also add in the constraint that some of the \\beta's are zero. Is it still possible to still use the convolution property (and the fact that the whole X matrix is circulant, symmetric) in some way? \n\nThis is important in my application, because discrete convolution is what makes the LS estimate of \\beta able to be computed and I have to do it several times.\n\nAny ideas or pointers on how to handle this? Has anyone dealt with this, in R or elsewhere?\n\nMany thanks and best wishes,\nRanjan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
