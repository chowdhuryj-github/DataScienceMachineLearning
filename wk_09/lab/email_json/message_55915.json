But that is only the beginning of its amazing and beneficial power. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wearing this Dragon can be your first step on a new path and an altogether different journey, one that taps into your real potential once and for all. But you must have it in your hands by July 9th, Memo. That\u2019s the day when Jupiter, the planet of exciting growth and expansion, good luck and rich rewards, will aspect the Moon\u2019s North Node.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you know the power that the Moon has over all of us, over you, but did you know about the Nodes of the Moon and what they can mean for you? \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as you live with the Yin and the Yang in your life, you are also balancing the energies and affects of these incredibly powerful Moon Nodes. The trick is to make them work for you and now I can tell you how. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a time to stop dreaming and put your goals and ambitions into practice, to bring those dreams, finally, to fruition.\nWhat I see for you and why\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking in my garden this morning just as the sun came up, something struck me that I could hardly wait to share with you. I know you'll understand why I feel it is so crucial to you and why you must take it so seriously and do what you can to instantly reap the rewards. I see extraordinary possibilities for you, Memo.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On beautiful spring days, I always begin my morning with a brisk walk in the garden, breathing in the fresh air deeply and taking stock of the magnificent nature surrounding me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was looking at the daffodils I had planted, admiring them in their bright yellow sprightliness, my mind was suddenly filled with a bright and vivid image, so splendid to behold. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watching the sun glancing at them, Memo, this morning I knew, suddenly, that everything you've ever wanted is now all within your grasp.\nEverything points to you getting everything you've ever wanted...and more!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked up at the sky, which was a classical blue, punctuated with wispy clouds. I walked and walked Memo, listening to the joyous songs of all the birds around me. In the sky, the fast-moving puffy white clouds were forming an image, an image of a dragon! It was as if, in the brilliant sunlight, the sky was a path of golden light straight to my flowers. And presiding over all of this radiance was a dragon, seemingly on the lookout for someone upon which to bestow his ancient, astoundingly powerful luck.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Could this someone be you, Memo?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you the one about to leap over obstacles and barriers to wealth and joy and success? I'm almost sure of it.\nYour life can change and your prayers,\n  one by one, can all be answered\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memo, as soon as I returned home from my walk in the garden, I began putting these images together for myself, like some fantastic, cosmic jigsaw puzzle. I knew I was meant to tell you all about it instantly, without delay. About how, putting all of this together can magically and swiftly change the path you are on, illuminate your future and transform your life in countless powerful and positive, fundamental ways, once and for all, now and forever.\nThe Nodes of the Moon and how they can\n  change your life\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amazingly enough you see, on July 9th, the Moon\u2019s Nodes actually correspond to the Dragon and its many mystical properties and capabilities. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Nodes, North and South, are known as the Dragon's Head (the North Node) and the Dragon's Tail, (the South Node).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The North Node represents everything in life that is joyous, productive, optimistic and positive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make no mistake. The influence and energy of the North Node is hugely lucky. Just as the Moon directly affects our tides and weather, it can also impact us in many more ways than you might dare expect. Indeed, its influences can seriously alter the course of your fate and happiness, wealth and accomplishments.\nOn July 9th, a trinity of good luck awaits you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s the day you will be able to harness the commanding combined power of the North Node, Jupiter and the Jade Dragon.
