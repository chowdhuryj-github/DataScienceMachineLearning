The information on the wiki is not always accurate.\nBut well you *can* use xulrunner, just the level of integration with\nSugar you can achieve using it is not satisfactory.\n\n> > 1 Write an embedding widget from scratch in Pyxpcom.

(what's your experience with it, is\nit reasonably stable and complete?)\n2 Time. Writing an embedding widget from scratch, make it stable etc\ndoes not seem like a trivial task.\n\n> > 2 Use gtkmozembed (written in C) but give access to the gtkmozembed\n> > nsIWebBrowser as a PyXPCOM object so that we can access the DOM document\n> > from python.

We need it as pyxpcom object\nso that we can access the DOM using pyxpcom (we don't want to write\nregular python bindings for the whole DOM api).\n\nMarco\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
