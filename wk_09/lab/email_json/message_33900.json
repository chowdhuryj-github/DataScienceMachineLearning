It's a problem with the label rotation calculation (some\nare NaN, so presumably there's a division by zero somewhere). I'll try\nto track it down.\n\nFor your example, I don't think labels are going to be of any use, so\nI would suggest you try something like\n\ncontourplot(bd.cn, cuts = 20, labels = FALSE)\n\nor\n\nlevelplot(bd.cn)\n\nboth of which should be fine.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
