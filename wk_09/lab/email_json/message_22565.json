What we \nfound was a setting in the high-speed modem where keep alive was set to 10 \nminutes, so we changed it to 999, now I have no issues like this--and I've run \nmutella-and-17 bittorrent sessions along with an ssh.\nHart\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
