However, I don't see how that would\nhave helped you with the map example, as plotting a \"trellis\" object\nwould also include the axes, labels, etc. What you really want is the\nability to draw a circle with differently colored angular segments,\nwhich can be reasonably approximated by polygons. polygon() and\ngrid.polygon() do these for traditional and grid graphics\nrespectively.\n\n-Deepayan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
