Although I can get the '2' into a subscript using expression(), \nR then forces me to leave at least one space between the '2' and the \nfollowing character. My label is supposed to read 'N2O concentration \n(ppm)', and the space between the '2' and the 'O' makes it look rather \ninelegant! My code is the following (the comments in it are there to stop \nme forgetting what I have done, I am new to R):\n\npostscript(file=\"/Users/patrickmartin/Documents/York Innova \nPrecision/N2Oinnova.eps\", horizontal=FALSE, onefile=FALSE, height=4, \nwidth=5, pointsize=10)\n> plot(n2o, lty=0, las=1, xlab=\"Time\", ylab=expression(N[2]~\"O \n> concentration (ppm)\")) points(n2o, pch=16) # suppresses line but adds \n> points dev.off() # turns postscript device off again\n\nOne possibility is for me to simply leave two spaces everywhere else, but \nthat looks a little strange. Does anyone know of a more elegant way of \nsolving the problem?\n\nA related query is that the journal I want to publish this figure in \nspecifies that if EPS format is used, the font should be either Arial, \nCourier, Helvetica, Times or Symbol. Is one of these the default font for \nan EPS file in R, and if not, is there a possibility of changing it?\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\nPatrick Martin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
