This is the value commonly called \nthe cumulative distribution function at the point z, or the integral \nfrom -Inf to z of the gaussian density.\n\npnorm(z, lower.tail=FALSE) gives the complement of the above, or 1 - \ncdf(z), and is the integral from z to Inf of the gaussian density.\n\nE.g.,\n\n > pnorm(1.96, lower.tail=TRUE)\n[1] 0.9750021\n > pnorm(1.96, lower.tail=FALSE)\n[1] 0.02499790\n >\n\nUse lower.tail=TRUE if you are, e.g., finding the probability at the \nlower tail of a confidence interval or if you want to the probability \nof values no larger than z.\n\nUse lower.tail=FALSE if you are, e.g., trying to calculate test value \nsignificance or at the upper confidence limit, or you want the \nprobability of values z or larger.\n\nYou should use pnorm(z, lower.tail=FALSE) instead of 1-pnorm(z) \nbecause the former returns a more accurate answer for large z.\n\nThis is really simple issue, and has no inherent complexity \nassociated with it.\n================================================================\nRobert A.
