I \nhooked a Power Braille 80 to one, and configured Brltty to use it.  Things \nwere always very unstable.  Brltty would routinely lose communications \nwith the Braille display, and thus, it would go dead for several seconds \nat a time, then come back resulting in error messages on the console. \nThis was especially bad when there was a lot of data being sent to the \ndisplay.  So, I now have the Braille display on a PCI serial card, the \nDectalk USB in serial mode on the one internal serial port, and my UPS on \nthe USB-to-serial converter.  This works quite well for me since the UPS \nsends no data, just changes one line when the power goes out, and another \nwhen the battery is about to die.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
