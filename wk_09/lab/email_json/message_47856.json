So $hash{undef} is equivalent to $hash{'undef'}.\n\nHash keys are strings.  Anything that's not a string gets\n\"stringified\" and that stringified value is used as the key.  You can\nnot store undef, a reference, or even a number as a key to a hash.\nYou can store only their stringified versions.\n\nThe stringified version of undef is the empty string.  Therefore,\n$hash{undef()} is exactly identical to $hash{\"\"}.  Observe:\n\n$ perl -MData::Dumper -le'\nmy %h;\n$h{undef()} = 1;\n$h{undef} = 2;\n$h{\"\"} = 3;\nprint Dumper(\\%h);\n'\n$VAR1 = {\n          '' => 3,\n          'undef' => 2\n        };\n\n$ perl -MData::Dumper -le'\nmy %h;\n$h{undef()} = 1;\n$h{undef} = 2;\n#$h{\"\"} = 3;\nprint Dumper(\\%h);\n'\n$VAR1 = {\n          '' => 1,\n          'undef' => 2\n        };\n\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
