I am trying to understand how I could move the installed\npackages in my R 2.3 version to the newly installed R 2.5 version, without\nhaving to install all the packages again. I copied the files under the old\nlibrary subdirectory to the new library subdirectory. But still the newer\nversion is not recognizing the packages that were copied over.\n\nThanks.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
