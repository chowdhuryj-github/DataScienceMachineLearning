But ''What can he do?''\nI would rather take hellebore than spend a conversation with a good, little man.\nBad weather always looks worse through a window.\nDiscipline is not a nasty word.\nFeedback is the breakfast of champions.\nIn art there are tears that lie too deep for thought.\nFor as one star another far exceeds, So souls in heaven are placed by their deeds.\nWe don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.\nYou cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.\nThe right name is an advertisement in itself.\nThe advice that is wanted is commonly not welcome and that which is not wanted, evidently an effrontery.\nNever claim as a right what you can ask as a favor.\nThe better I know men the more I admire dogs.\nIf moderation is a fault, then indifference is a crime.\nConcentrate your strengths against your competitor's relative weaknesses.\nThere is nothing more likely to start disagreement among people or countries than an agreement.\nEducation costs money, but then so does ignorance.\nAviation is proof that given, the will, we have the capacity to achieve the impossible.\nThat which makes people dissatisfied with their condition, is the chimerical idea they form of the happiness of others.\n\u00a0"}
