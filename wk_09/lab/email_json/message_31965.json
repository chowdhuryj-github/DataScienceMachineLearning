So yes, you could have 1 cd-rom drive, and 3 hard\ndrives, or any combination there of. You need to make sure that all\nyour devices are jumpered properly, and that the bios is set up to\nrecognize your drives correctly.\n\nSeriously, if you find yourself running out of room a good part of the\ntime, consider getting a bigger drive, that's what I ended up having\nto do. I do seem to recall though, that you have an older system\nrunning win98. If that's the case, then your bios might not be able to\nfully recognize the capacity on today's drives, depending on how old\nyour system is. This of course, might or might not be fixed by a newer\nversion of your bios, assuming the bios on your board is flashable,\nand not an eprom.\n\nBTW, I do recall this kind of stuff being discussed on here more then once,\nso you might want to have a look through the list archives.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Thu, May 17, 2007 at 10:25:31AM -0600, TheCreator wrote:\n> Hello list,\n> I read somewhere on google that it was possible to hook 3 hds up to a \n> system with out the raid card.\n> It said that you could disconnect the cd drive, and use the IDE cable from \n> that to hook up a hd.\n> My problem, is I'm running out of room.
