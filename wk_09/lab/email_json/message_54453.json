If businesses had any compassion, they could run \noff a few special assistive products just for the hell of it, not to \nmake money, but just to be compassionate.  It's the people who \nabsolutely have to make a business out of it, profitable or non-profit, \nthat are screwing us.  To *stay* in business, they have to inflate the \nprice.  We could all convert to communism, but hello, the government is \nalready confiscating the money to pay for our needs anyway.  What's the \ndifference?  I don't like it, but there's no other choice.  Life blows \nchunks. \n\n        Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
