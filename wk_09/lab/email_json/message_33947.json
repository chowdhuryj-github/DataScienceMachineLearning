You can also find the source on SourceForge \nusing Google.\n\nHowever, it didn't work for me:  I still get the \"interactivity reduced\" \nmessage, and when I try to plot something, just an error \n\"CGGSStackRestore:  gstack underflow.\"\n\nThis is in R in a terminal, with sessionInfo reporting:\n\nR version 2.5.0 (2007-04-23)\ni386-apple-darwin8.9.1\n\nwith CarbonEL \"0.1-3\".\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n> \n> Also I tried setting the DISPLAY (probably incorrectly, since I don't\n> understand what's going on).
