You say it's\n\"not ... something the social contract cares about\". That's not at all\nclear from reading it -- the social contract makes a straightforward\npromise, which has no exception for this, yet we're acting as though\nsuch an exception were there.\n\nOnly by reading a thread like this, or some other discussion which has\nno obvious connection from the Social Contract, can newcomers learn\nthis exception under which we act. That's what the proposed GR is\nseeking to rectify.\n\n-- \n \\     \"I thought I'd begin by reading a poem by Shakespeare, but then |\n  `\\        I thought 'Why should I?
