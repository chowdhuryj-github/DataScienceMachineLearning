Am I \ncorrect?  Also, I understand that gpedit.msc works now.  However, I have \nno luck being able to use it.  I get a permissions error.  Here is my \nsmb.conf with the share definitions.  Please help me so that I can \ncontinue to test.  Thanks.\n\n[NETLOGON]\npath = /usr/local/samba/netlogon\nread only = no\n\n[SYSVOL]\npath = /usr/local/samba/private\nread only = no\n\nWhen I try to launch the editor, I get the following message: \"Failed to \nOpen the Group Policy Object.  You may not have the apropriate rights.  \nDetails: The System cannot find the specified path.\"  I also notice that \nwhen launching the editor from AD Users and Groups only the edit and \nproperties buttons are available to me.\n\nThanks much,\nMatt\n\n"}
