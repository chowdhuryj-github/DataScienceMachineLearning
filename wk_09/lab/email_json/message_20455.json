I don't recall having seen\nany off topic posts recently.\n\nAs for the ubuntu/orca/newby questions posts, this still deals with\ngnu/linux. As far as I know, Kirk's policy has always been that\nanything gnu/linux related goes. Unless Kirk has changed this\nrecently, all the recent ubuntu/orca/newby posts would seem to be\nalong those lines. Now, if Kirk has changed this recently, then you'd\nbe right that this is OT. My apologies to Kirk of course if anything\nI've said here is out of line.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 30, 2007 at 12:34:16PM -0500, John Heim wrote:\n> Is anyone besides me bothered by the huge number of off-topic posts to this \n> list?\n> \n> I guess I've gone OT a few times myself.
