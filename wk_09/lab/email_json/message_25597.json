Sorry to disagree with you, but this seems wrong to me.\nElsewhere in PDD07, it says: \"neither PARROT_IN_CORE nor the outermost\n_GUARD #ifdefs cause the level of indenting to increase.\"  So I think\nthe indentation was right.\n\nI'm in #parrot, if you'd like to discuss this.  And thanks for looking\nat my patch!\n\nMark\n\n"}
