Is floating point arithmetic also the reason why \n\n1 %% 0.1\n\ngives the \"surprising\" answer 0.1 (because 0.1 cannot be written as a \nfraction with denominator a power of 2, e.g. 1%%0.5 correctly gives 0).\n\nThis seems to go a bit against the statement in the help for '%%', which \nstates \"For real arguments, '%%' can be subject to catastrophic loss of \naccuracy if 'x' is much larger than 'y', and a warning is given if this \nis detected.\"\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
