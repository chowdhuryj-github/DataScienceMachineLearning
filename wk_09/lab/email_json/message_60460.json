The idea would be to use the\nfiles inode as the dir name 0x123456 and inside it the stream name as\nfile name for the stream. This way renaming or moving the file wouldn't\nloose the streams. Does it make sense?\n\nSimo.\n\n-- \nSimo Sorce\nSamba Team GPL Compliance Officer\nemail: idra@samba.org\nhttp://samba.org\n\n"}
