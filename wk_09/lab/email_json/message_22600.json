It won't be with our discount Canadian pharmacy.\n\"High price proves the high quality of the drug\" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.\nDon't look for prices lower than those at CanadianPharmacy anything that is cheaper is a fake.\nYours,Brigitte Nickerson\n\n\n\n\n"}
