It's not parrot that makes these possible.\n\nOf course, but \"Turing equivalence\" is a really bad reason to do something \nthat no one involved has any interest in doing.  I assume that the people \nworking on building compiler tools in Parrot have more interest in getting \nthem working with Parrot than with any other VMs.  Likewise I assume that any \npeople who might have an interest in getting them working with VMs have other \nthings to do, so that's why we have a few of the former and none of the \nlatter.\n\nI mean, people aren't using Parrot right now much.  I have little interest in \ndoing things that make it less likely for them to use Parrot.\n\n-- c\n\n"}
