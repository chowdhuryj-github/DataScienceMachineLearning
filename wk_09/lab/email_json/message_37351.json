So...I was wondering what steps I would need to follow to recompile the kernel?  (I've recompiled the kernel before, certainly, in Gentoo.  I don't think they're too different...But do I just use the stuff in /usr/src/linux of my HD installation as is, or do I get another package with aptitude first?)\nWhat option is it, exactly, that I need to change?  I'm not sure where I'd copy the kernel image when done, etc.\nThanks,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
