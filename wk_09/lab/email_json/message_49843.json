The topic of Speakup support being taken out of Gentoo sources was, I suppose, a rather sensative one for me.  I have had a great deal of success with it.\n    The irony in all this, I suppose, is that I recently switched away from Gentoo-sources and took up Vanilla-sources.  This was because the CVS version of Speakup used in Gentoo-sources has problems with my synthesizer: problems fixed by my manual patching in of a more recent version.\n    I am confedent that in time we can work out a solution.  I'm not a technical person in a lot of ways: far be it from me to say what will work best.  I was rather strident in defending my points, and that wasn't called for.  Deedra, in particular, I apologize for beating a dead horse and not being more far-sighted.  \n    I'd hope something can be decided upon which will satisfy everybody here.  Maybe a complete rewrite of Speakup is called for, I don't know.  \nI remain, nevertheless, yours,\nZachary Kline.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
