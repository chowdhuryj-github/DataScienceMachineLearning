You give some extra arguments to thisfunction.The first goes the vector, the second goes the function, and then -additional arguments to the function.Probably, you wanted w[sapply(abs(w),\">\",0.6)]This gives the same result.\n-- View this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Selecting-all-values-smaller-than-X-in-a-dataframe-tf3901238.html#a11059804Sent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
