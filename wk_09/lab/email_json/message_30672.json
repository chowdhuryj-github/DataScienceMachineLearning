I'm going to school for IT,\nand hope to get a job in networking at some point soon, so made sure the\nlaptop I got had a serial port.  While this wasn't the only deciding factor,\nit was pretty high on the list.  I was willing to sacrafice some of the 8 or\n16 serial ports on certain laptops (why would someone want that many USB on\na laptop anyway)? for a serial port.\nOn Tue, May 15, 2007 at 03:39:24PM -0500, Brent Harding wrote:\n> Well, what about that gear that is probably in service all around that \n> uses serial ports for administration?
