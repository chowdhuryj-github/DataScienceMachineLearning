And at what \ndate will 2.6.22 become Gentoo's main line kernel?  Also, is there a shot at \nsomeone forking a Gentoo live CD and kernel set to include speakup when the \n2.6.22 bug is fixed?  I'd do it myself, but I'm not a programmer.\n\nI have to reinstall linux because I'm changing machines soon.  Gentoo was my \nfavorite distribution ever since I began using it.  In a lot of cases, \ninstalling programs just...works...And I can't say that for Debian, Fedora, \nor any other distribution (don't get me started.)  So, I hope some of these \nquestions can be answered.\nThanks,\nNick\n\nLong Island, New york\n\nEmail or MSN/windows messenger: nick@HKCRadio.comm\nAIM: hkcradio\nskype: nick6489\nWeb page: www.hkcradio.com \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
