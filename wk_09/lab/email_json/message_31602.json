What do you do when patients come who can't pay? Some\ndoctors decline to see them. I have expenses to pay and a family to\nfeed, they'll argue.\n\nBut I grew up in a rural part of Ohio where an inordinate number poor\npeople live. My mother is a pediatrician there, and from the start, she\ncould not imagine turning children away. Up to 20 percent of her\npatients have been without insurance, and more than half were on\nMedicaid, which paid terribly and was refused by other doctors. Some\npatients were not very grateful. Some were not as poor as they claimed.\nBut we could count on my father's better-paying urology practice to\ncross-subsidize. So that's what she did.\n\nThe message from my parents was straightforward: We are in medicine and\nthat comes with certain moral obligations. So I've understood that part\nof my job is to see those who can't pay - even if sometimes it hurts.\n\nI've been thinking about this as I've watched the arguments unfold about\nwhat pharmaceutical companies should charge in the developing world. The\nhistory of H.I.V. drugs has not been pretty. First, for almost a decade,\nwe in the West ignored the possibility that antiretroviral drugs could\nbe used in the developing world. (Remember the 2001 claim of U.S.\ngovernment officials that Africans couldn't learn to take the drugs on\ntime because they didn't have watches?) Then, under international\npressure, drug companies made some discounts, but they were not deep\nenough. (A year's supply was still more than $1,000 per patient.) Only\nwhen an Indian generic manufacturer provided a copycat three-drug\nregimen for $150 per year and major donors stepped forward did\ndistribution effectively reach poor countries.\n\nWe're now in the throes of another round of H.I.V. drug battles, this\ntime over advanced, but even more expensive drug regimens from Merck and\nAbbott Laboratories. Last week, the Clinton Foundation endorsed\ndecisions by Thailand and Brazil to break the companies' patents and\npurchase cheaper, copycat versions of the drugs. Abbott retaliated by\nwithholding seven new drugs from Thailand, including an antibiotic, a\npainkiller, and a medication for high-blood pressure. The fight has\nbecome vicious.\n\nIn a way, it's hard to see how the confrontation could be avoided. The\ncost of developing a new drug now approaches $1 billion, and companies\ndo need profit margins to recoup that cost and encourage new innovation.\nYet, once a life-saving discovery is made, it is clearly grotesque to\nmake millions suffer or die while waiting for a 20-year patent to\nexpire.\n\nThe experience with H.I.V. drugs is oddly heartening, though. There is,\nin fact, a spectrum of behavior among pharmaceutical companies - just\nlike with doctors. Gilead Sciences has granted licenses to generic\nmanufacturers to supply its blockbuster H.I.V. drug, Viread, to the\nworld's hundred poorest countries at the reasonable royalty rate of 5\npercent of sales. Bristol-Meyers Squibb licensed its second-line drug,\nReyataz, completely free of royalties to generic manufacturers for India\nand southern Africa. And through the World Health Organization's bulk\nvaccine purchasing arrangements, manufacturers have been able to make\nsignificant profits selling vaccines at low cost but large volumes. This\nis the progress we want to build upon.\n\nPressure to broaden these efforts will grow, and it should. Agreement on\nregional pricing tiers and distribution networks for H.I.V. drugs show\nlikelihood of solidifying in ways that make drugs available and support\ninnovation, but we have nothing like it for drugs for heart disease,\nlung disease, or cancer. Meanwhile, the world is changing. The No. 1\ncause of death in India, China, and Vietnam is not H.I.V. It's heart\ndisease. Cancer is in the top 10. Their people need clot-busting drugs,\nchemotherapies, and EKG machines just like everyone else. Manufacturers\nneed to show the same willingness to make these life-saving technologies\navailable to the poor.\n\nSome will argue, hey, companies just invent this stuff; it isn't their\njob to make sure every country gets some. But that's not right. As\nArthur Caplan, the bioethicist, points out, \"You aren't manufacturing\npantyhose when you're in health care. There are special moral duties\nattached.\"\n\nAnd one of them is: If you're building a lifeboat, you have to think\nabout how many you can get inside.\n\nAtul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a\nNew Yorker staff writer, is the author of the new book \"Better.\" He is a\nguest columnist this month.\n\n\n\n*****************************************\nAnn-Mudle Sevcsik\nDrugs for Neglected Diseases initiative\nPlace St Gervais 1 / 1201 Geneva / Switzerland\n+41 (0)22 906 9230/50 (office/direct); + 41(0)22 906 9231 (fax)\n+41 (0)79 814 9147 (mobile)\namsevcsik@dndi.org\n\nDNDi has just launched its first product: read more at\nwww.actwithasaq.org\nLearn more about 'Best sciences for the most neglected' at www.dndi.org\nFind out how to wake up your governments at www.researchappeal.org\n*****************************************\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
