What I would like to do is to overlay the plot of my fitted values with the different intercept for each level in my ordinal data. I can do something like:lines(rep(intercept1, 1000), seq(from=0,to=max(fit),by=max(fit)/1000))where my intercept1 is, for example, the intercept that breaks between y=1 and y=2 labels and the max(fit) is the maximum of overall fitted values or maximum of all ordinal y labels. I'm wondering if there is better way to do this? If you could let me know, I would really appreciated. Thank you.- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
