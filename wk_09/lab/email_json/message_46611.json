If I turn some AGPLed code into a local \ngraphics-editing application which has no network capabilities, it's \nfairly clear that it doesn't apply.\n\nBut then, what happens if I access that desktop using remote X? Hmm...\n\nLet's say the clause instead said that anyone who interacts with the \nwork had to get access to the corresponding source, full stop (no \nnetwork need be involved). Would that be less ambiguous, I wonder?\n\n>> (if your version supports\n>> such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source\n>> of your version by providing access to copy the Corresponding Source\n>> from a network server at no charge.\n> \n> :::: Bad: use restriction, with a cost associated to it\n> \n> This restriction compels whoever runs the modified version of the\n> Program to accommodate the source code on the server or, alternatively,\n> to set up and maintain a separate network server to provide source code:\n> this may be a significant cost in some cases.\n\nI don't understand this argument. Having to provide CDs of source or \nfulfil the terms of a written offer is also a significant cost, but \nno-one thinks that makes the GPL non-free.\n\n> This is ultimately a use restriction (from the point of view of whoever\n> runs the modified version of the Program) \n\nWhat does it prevent you using the Program for?\n\n> and effectively forbids\n> private use of the modified version on a publicly accessible server. \n\nWell, it forbids public use of the modified version on a publicly \naccessible server. :-) But of course it does - that's the point. But \nthen the GPL forbids giving someone the use of the modified version via \ngiving them a copy without handing them the source code at the same \ntime. That's not a use restriction.\n\nThe AGPL clearly passes the Desert Island test (and the Tentacles of \nEvil test). I'm not sure the current wording of the Dissident test had \nthis situation in mind, but I think a good argument could be made that \nit passes.\n\n(Incidentally, what part of the DFSG is the Dissident test supposed to \nhelp test against?)\n\nGerv\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
