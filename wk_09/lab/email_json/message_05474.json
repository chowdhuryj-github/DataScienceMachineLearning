It can (and probably will) be only a\ntransitional package in the near future.\n\n> desktop-artwork -\n> This would clearly be a package that provides desktop artwork for themes\n> and other forms of visual improvements.

I agree with\nthe auto mounting stuff and I would prefer call this\ndebian-desktop-utils.\n\n> I think adding the prefix debian- to these package name is a good idea.\n> Although the debian- prefix may seem unnecessary it makes creating\n> things like ubuntu-desktop-base and distroX-desktop-base [1] much\n> simpler.

Actually distroX-desktop-base is a reality with the\nalternatives we've in place for desktop-base, did you see?\n\n> (...)\n> I don't think splitting desktop-art into GNOME, KDE, XFCE versions is\n> necessary or even a good idea.

I also work on a mainly pt_BR CDD and the\ncurrent desktop-base approach doesn't fail on this camp. The point of\nrenaming is that add utils and artwork in a package called 'base' is\nconfusing, what isn't base then?\n\nregards,\n-- stratus\nhttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
