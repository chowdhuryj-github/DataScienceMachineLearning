Maybe we should improve the error message by\nexplicitely trying to catch this error.\n\nYou can easily check this, e.g., via\n  any(table(time(zoo_object)) > 1)\n\n> The input/output from a recent R Console session might help,\n\nNot really, the data itself would have been much more helpful...and even\nbetter some simplified artificial data set.\n\nhth,\nZ\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
