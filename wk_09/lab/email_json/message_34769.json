For example, over a 10 year period in the Sanders\nbill.  The relationship between the patent system and prizes is also\nmore nuanced.

Essentially, the court\ndecided that \"obvious\" combinations of previous inventions do not\nwarrant protection under U.S. patent law.\n\nThe case before the high court was KSR International Co. v. Teleflex\nInc. The dispute was over a patent for gas pedals. Teleflex had\ncombined two existing inventions -- an electronic throttle control\nand an adjustable pedal. The Court ruled that this was too obvious a\ncombination to warrant protection under a new patent.\n\nUnfortunately, the court's ruling will have implications that go far\nbeyond gas pedals. Namely, it will stifle innovation in the\npharmaceutical industry -- which, ultimately, will have a negative\nimpact on the future of public health.\n\nAccording to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion,\n\"Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the\nordinary course without real innovation retards progress and\nmay...deprive prior inventions of their value or utility.\"\n\nAt first glance, that seems to be somewhat reasonable -- for things\nlike gas pedals. The problem is, 21st century medicine has very\nlittle in common with automobile parts.\n\nIn medical innovation today, there are precious few \"Eureka!\"\nmoments. Progress is made step-by-step, one incremental innovation at\na time. Those advances require extensive research. And they're\nterrifically expensive. On average, it takes nearly a billion dollars\nto bring a new drug to market.\n\nBut this slow, steady progress is how today's medical advances are\nmade -- not through Hollywood-style \"Aha!\" moments so popular with\npoliticians and pundits.\n\n\nNEVERTHELESS, GENERIC DRUG MAKERS routinely challenge the patents of\nname-brand drug makers in court, claiming that they're too obvious to\nwarrant patent protection.\n\nIt's far cheaper for generic companies to wage these legal battles\nthan invent the drugs themselves. If they win, they can reap the\nbenefits of the hundreds of millions worth of research that a name-\nbrand company spent developing the drug. If the drug is denied patent\nprotection, generic companies move in to reproduce low-cost copies of\nthe same molecular combinations.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that the name-brand companies cannot\nrecoup their R&D costs if their patents aren't upheld. As a result,\nthey will have less incentive to invest in developing new drugs in\nthe future.\n\nThe high court's ruling will make pharmaceutical innovation more\ndifficult by reducing the incentive for companies to make small steps\nforward. If the courts don't recognize the concept of incremental\ninnovation as worthy of patent protection, investors simply won't pay\nfor it.\n\nAnd if investors won't pay because there's no profit motive, name-\nbrand companies will be unable to pursue incremental advances.\n\nIf the current system collapses, what's the alternative? Who will pay\ndrug companies to invent new drugs?\n\n\nDISTURBINGLY, SOME FOLKS ARE now advocating a \"prize\" system where\nthere are no drug patents. Instead, the government would pay a drug\nmaker a lump sum for its innovation, and then the new drug would\nimmediately be placed in the public domain.\n\nThis is unlikely to work. The government \"prize\" model has already\nbeen used in the past -- in the old Soviet Union. And it was a\nspectacular disaster. The Soviet experience was characterized by low\nlevels of monetary compensation and poor innovative performance.\n\nThere's also the problematic issue of how such a sum would be\ndetermined.\n\nThe United States government does not have a good track record when\nit comes to rewarding inventors.\n\nFor example, the federal government paid Robert Goddard -- \"the\nfather of American rocketry\" -- $1 million as compensation for his\nbasic liquid rocket patents. That was hardly a fair price given that\nduring the remaining life of those patents, U.S. expenditures on\nliquid-propelled rockets amounted to around $10 billion.\n\nEven though the \"prize\" system is widely acknowledged to be a\ncrackpot idea, it has a frightening number of supporters in high\nplaces -- including the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn fact, Sen. Bernie Sanders is introducing federal legislation to\ncreate a prize system for medical innovations. Leave it to the\nsenator from Vermont to come up with a Ben & Jerry's-style solution.\n\nIf only inventing the cure for cancer were as easy as dreaming up a\nnew flavor of ice cream.\n\n\nPeter J. Pitts is president of the Center for Medicine in the Public\nInterest and a former FDA associate commissioner.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\nJames Packard Love\nKnowledge Ecology International\nmailto:james.love@keionline.org\ntel. +1.202.332.2670 / U.S. mobile+1.202.361.3040, Geneva mobile\n+41.76.413.6584\n\n\"If everyone thinks the same: No one thinks.\" Bill Walton\"\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
