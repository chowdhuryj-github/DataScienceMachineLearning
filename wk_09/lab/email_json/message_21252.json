By specifying 'event' as you did,\nSurv assumes that you have 3 arguments of \"type\"=counting and it is looking\nfor the ending time required by the counting data format and this is why you\ngot the error.\n\nIf you are not afraid of R code, type Surv (without the parentheses) to see\nthe code behind the function.\n\n-Christos\n\nChristos Hatzis, Ph.D.\nNuvera Biosciences, Inc.\n400 West Cummings Park\nSuite 5350\nWoburn, MA 01801\nTel: 781-938-3830\nwww.nuverabio.com\n \n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Jennifer Dillon\n> Sent: Tuesday, May 01, 2007 11:16 PM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] the Surv function\n> \n> Hi,\n> \n> I'm trying to do a simple survival analysis on some data, and \n> I'm having the following problem (here's my code and the \n> error message):\n> \n> out <- Surv(fup,event=status)\n> Error in Surv(fup, event = status) : argument \"time2\" is \n> missing, with no default\n> \n> >From reading the documentation, it seems that I should be able to \n> >simply\n> write:  Surv(time1, event)  if my data is right-censored, which it is.\n> Help!\n> \n> Thanks a million,\n> \n> Jen\n> \n> \n> \n> --\n> Jennifer Dillon\n> Doctoral Student\n> Harvard Biostatistics\n> Room 414B, Building 1\n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide \n> http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
