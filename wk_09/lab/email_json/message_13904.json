How does one measure, if it's leaking memory?\n\nPresumably, every iteration of the loop uses the same \"physical\"\nregister. This should free up the String from the previous iteration\nfor collection. If there's a leak, memory would climb higher and\nhigher; if there's not, it should level out.\n\n-- \nMatt Diephouse\nhttp://matt.diephouse.com\n\n"}
