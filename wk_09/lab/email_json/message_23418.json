But I never got an answer from l-l.net for my notes \non the ThinkPad 600E:\n    http://home.comcast.net/~jyavner/TP600E/\n\n\n> Most people will no doubt look on those sites before searching this\n> mailing list. \n\nYes.  Really the question I am asking on this list is, \"Why doesn't \nanybody sell pre-tuned Linux install disks for specific laptop models?  \nWould you ever buy (have bought) such a thing?\"\n\nI bought my 600E from http://LinuxCertified.com  It worked out of the \nbox!  But their T22-with-Ubuntu is twice the price of the T23 I bought \nsans OS.  Is it really worth $200 to have somebody else install/tune \nLinux for you?  What if I just sold a DVD without the hardware?\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
