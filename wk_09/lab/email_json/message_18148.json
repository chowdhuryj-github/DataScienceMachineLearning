I show how difficult it is and what a messy thing it is to \n      kill a man.\" - Alfred Hitchcock \n\nDID YOU KNOW?The dollar was established as the official \n      currency of the US in 1785. \n\nSATURDAY\nON 48 HOURSHere's a note from Bill Lagattuta on Saturday's 48 \n      Hours Mystery, Murder in the Fast Lane: \n      \"The story of Mickey Thompson is the story of a genuine American \n      hero--the man who at one time was the fastest man on earth. He was a \n      down-to-earth racing icon, a tough businessman, an innovator and he was \n      married to the love of his life, Trudy. It all came to a horrible end \n      almost twenty years ago when Mickey and Trudy were gunned down, execution \n      style, in the driveway of their Los Angeles area home. I remember covering \n      this story as a young news reporter, and it's fitting for me to be present \n      at the final chapter. From the beginning, the focus of the \n      investigation was Mickey Thompson's colorful business partner, Mike \n      Goodwin. But there was no physical evidence to tie him to the crimes. For \n      the past two decades, through a series of fascinating twists and turns, \n      detectives and Thompson's hard-driving sister Colleen have been pursuing \n      Goodwin, hoping his flamboyant personality and his big mouth would be his \n      undoing. In our program this week, we will take you step by step through \n      this fascinating case... and you'll be able to watch what many considered \n      the surprise ending in court. Murder in the Fast Lane was an \n      amazing story for me to live, and to report. I hope you will join us on \n      Saturday night.\" - Bill Lagattuta (48 Hours \n      Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT) If you would like \n      more information on any of these stories or the broadcast, please click on \n      the following address and e-mail us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n      \n\nTONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWSHere is \n      an early preview of what Awe are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING NEWS \n      from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric... Hi \n      everyone, I'll be anchoring our broadcast tonight from \n      Chicago, the unofficial capital of the Midwest - known for its deep-dish \n      pizza, vibrant sports teams and rich political history.

There's a new gold rush in the Midwest. But this time, \n      the prized loot is not a mineral - it's a vegetable. As Cynthia \n      Bowers will report, farmers are planting record crops of corn this \n      season to keep up with the growing demand for the corn-derived fuel \n      additive ethanol. Finally, I'll give you a look at the \n      political character of the Windy City, from its earliest days right up to \n      the 2008 election. I hope you'll join me. Have a great \n      weekend!
