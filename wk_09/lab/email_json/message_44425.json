I have tried using sudo nano\nspeech.conf in the directory where the file is but for some reason it\nis not opening it and I have also tried vi with the same results.\nWhen I try editors like Nano and vi I am wondering if it is trying to\ncreate new files rather than allow me to modify the existing file.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
