I have finally figured out how to import my data by using the >read.delim(\"Filename\", header=TRUE) which took some time because I had to change the directory (a hint for others who might be struggling).  \n\nHowever, I am now stuck on being able to use my data.  I read that I will have to use some command like attach() but when I try to do anything with my data even say data.frame() I don't know how to call my data.  If I say data.frame(\"filename\") it says object not found.  So basically I don't know how to call my data.  Suggestions?\n\nThanks,\nSusie\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
