Since we're just as vulernable to\ncases where the copyright holder is untruthfully specified, I don't\nthink it's necessary to go overboard with proof.\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n \n-- \nThe beauty of the DRUNKENNESS subprogram was that you could move your\nintoxication level up and down at will, instead of being caught on a\nrelentless down escalator to bargain basement philosophy and the\nparking garage.\n -- Rudy von Bitter _Software_ p124\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
