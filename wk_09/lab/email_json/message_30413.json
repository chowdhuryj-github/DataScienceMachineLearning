Over the next couple of years we \nwill increasingly move over to ultra-mobile technologies. These will \nrequire lean kernels but there is scope for many options in user-space. \nUbuntu is working actively with Intel on these new platform to make sure \naccessibility is a consideration from the very start. Hopefully we can \navoid the long accessibility gap we had with mobile phones.\n\nHenrik\n\nC.M.
