I was able to obtain error correction term (ect) from cajorls$rlm$model properly. According the my ca.jo object on 2-variate series, the test suggests that the integration rank is 1. Which means that my ect should be stationary. However, I did test stationariy on ect and it shows non-stationarity and my acf still shows high and long autocorrelation. How should I interpret the result from Johansen then?\n\n2. In some cases for 2-variate series, I found that Johansen testing shows that my test statistics are lower than the 5% for both r <= 0 and r <= 1. That means I have 1 or 0 cointegration relationship? How should I interpret this result? \n\nThank you,\n\n- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
