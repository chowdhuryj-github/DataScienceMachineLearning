I am approaching success using the\n\"heatmap\" function in the \"stats\" package without dendorgrams, however, am\nrunning into trouble in that the colors get lighter with more positive\noutcomes in a column (time point).  Is there a way to make the colors\nuniform irrespective of the number of similar values in the column? or this\npart of the heatmap function?\n\nOther suggestions for representing the data graphically are certainly\nwelcome as well.\n\nThanks,\nPatrick\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
