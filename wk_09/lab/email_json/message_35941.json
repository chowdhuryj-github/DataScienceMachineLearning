When you are ceding rights, interest, money, or other\nintangibles to the licensor or original author, you are paying them\nfor using their software in a form of currency.\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nIf I had a letter, sealed it in a locked vault and hid the vault\nsomewhere in New York. Then told you to read the letter, thats not\nsecurity, thats obscurity. If I made a letter, sealed it in a vault,\ngave you the blueprints of the vault, the combinations of 1000 other\nvaults, access to the best lock smiths in the world, then told you to\nread the letter, and you still can't, thats security.\n -- Bruce Schneier\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
