I have been asked to install a list of some 200 packages (from\nCRAM) to R.  Rather than installing each package manually, I was hoping I\ncould script this.  I've written a BASH script that hopefully will do this,\nbut I'm wondering about the Mirror Selection portion of the installation\nprocess.  I've looked and can't find anywhere a parameter to supply that\nspecifies a mirror to use so that I don't have to manually select it for\neach package I want to install.  In this case, with nearly 200 packages to\ninstall, this could become quite tedious.  Does anyone have any suggestions?\nThanks!\n\n \n\n-Kermit Short\n\nK_short@lanl.gov\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
