It'a a pity\nI can't use it for larger projects or can I?\n\nFor instance suppose I have three files file1.rnw, file2.rnw and\nfile3.rnw with Sweave code.  Working on file2.rnw I whould like to\nexclude file1.rnw and file3.rnw temporarily and joining all of them\nlater.  This amounts to a mechanism similar to using LaTeX's \\include\ncommand.  *Is* there a way to achieve that?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nD.
