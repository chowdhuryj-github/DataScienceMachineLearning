We have a range of new projects in the works both for the \nvisually impaired and other groups. See: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/Specs\n\nHenrik\n\n\nps. I originally sent this on 30/04, but as was not subscribed it must \nhave bounced\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
