So I think this function is not for me since\nlong-tailed samples aren't normally distribuited (right?!)\n\nI've found the Marsaglia article (\"Evaluating the Anderson Darling\ndistribution\") where it seems I can consider the ECDF (empirical CDF) and\nthe theoretical as a uniformly [0,1] distributed data and then perform the\ntest like I had to compare two uniform distribution. The problem is the\ntheoretical CDF (i.e. the parameters of theoretical distribution) has been\nestimated from the data against which I want to make the test. I've read\nsomewhere it's not a good technique to compare the distribution with the\nabove way because the resulting AD test might be biased.\n\nSo, finally, I don't know how to proceed ...\n\nCan anyone give me a help or any reference (please remember I'm not a\nstatistician so do not write too technically)??\n\nThanks a lot to everyone!!\n\n-- Marco\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
