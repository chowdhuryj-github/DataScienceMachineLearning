Carbonated beverage consumption is dwindling.\n                      Sales of carbonated soda beverages declined two years in a row because consumers are rapidly switching to healthier products. \nMarket share gains are going to innovative beverage companies like Celsius (OTCBB: CSUH), which is profiled in this report.                  \nMost importantly, savvy investors are bagging terrific profits from this emerging consumer trend. \n                  For example, early investors in Hansen Natural rode this natural beverage producer to gains of 3,108% from 2004 through 2006.\nMore recently, Jones Soda, another new beverage company with healthful products virtually doubled over-night when they announced they are reformulating their products using cane sugar in place of the industry standard, high fructose corn syrup.\nYou too could potentially bag huge profits like these by taking a position in my latest recommendation \u2014 Celsius Holdings, Inc. (OTCBB: CSUH).\n                  Celsius is like Hansen and Jones, but it is carving out a whole new beverage category with one of the hottest new beverages on the market.\n\n\nI\u2019m heartily recommending Celsius because the company has all the ingredients for success: Innovation, brand recognition, customer appeal, astute management and strong distribution partners\u2026These are the keys to success in the beverage industry and Celsius has them all.  I urge you to learn more about this exciting opportunity. The profit potential is enormous.\nInnovative New Product \u2013 Category Killer\n\nCelsius\u2019 new product is a flavorful, healthful carbonated soft drink that has the potential to become the ultimate diet soft drink and even more because of its remarkable calorie burning qualities.\nYes, we\u2019re talking about \u201cnet-negative\u201d calories. Celsius is the first soda clinically proven to raise metabolism and burn calories. The company provides proof positive of its claim that their drink increases metabolism by \u201c12% over a three hour period.\u201d\nAvailable in five tasty flavors, the soda also contains a flavorful blend of natural ingredients including nutrients, caffeine and botanicals. That makes the product desirable not only for diet-conscious consumers, but also the rapidly growing energy drink market.\nCelsius contains Green Tea with EGCG, Ginger, Calcium, Chromium, caffeine, vitamins and nutrients. With these ingredients and even more importantly, NO carbs, NO sugar, NO chemical preservatives, NO high fructose corn syrup and Very Low sodium, you can see why Celsius\u2019 distinct product advantages are driving strong consumer acceptance.\n\nThe Buzz \n\nYou may not be aware of it but, if you are, you already know Celsius is showing up everywhere in the news. The company hardly needs to pay for celebrity endorsement as the product already has incredible press and TV coverage. \nIt has been featured in over 1,000 television segments, viewed by an estimated 80 million people. Perhaps you saw Celsius on the Food Network Unwrapped TV show or read about Celsius being in celebrity gift bags at the Oscars.\nThe star of NBC\u2019s Today\u2019s Show, Matt Lauer said to millions of viewers after taking a sip of Celsuis, \u201cWow! That\u2019s Good!\u201d\nIn addition to notable celebrities, the beverage industry is excited about Celsius. Beverage Industry Magazine gave Celsius their Best New Beverage Award for 2006. Celsius was also a finalist for the prestigious CSP Retailer Choice Best New Product of 2006. \nCelsius was a double winner in Beverage Innovation Magazine\u2019s 2007 Global Beverage Innovation Awards. The product received the Best New Functional Drink for 2007 and was runner-up in the Best New Health Initiative category.\nThere\u2019s no question the beverage giants know about Celsius\u2019 exciting new product. Could that mean a buy-out is in the future for the company? \nYou bet a buy-out could happen, but even without a buyout, which often explodes the current share price, Celsius\u2019 stock isn\u2019t going to trade in its current $1.00-$1.25 range for very long because\u2026\nExpanding Distribution \n\nDistribution is a major key to success in the beverage industry. Impressively, the company is aligning themselves with top flight distributors capable of meeting the company\u2019s aggressive sales growth targets.\nCelsius is currently adding distributors in key regional markets and is well on their way to complete national distribution. \nFor example, they just announced Fred W. Losch Beverage Company as their distributor in suburban Chicago. Losch adds more than 1,800 accounts. Combined with Skokie Valley Beverage Company, which picked up the account in March, Celsius is now available across the third largest metropolitan area in the country with over 9 million thirsty consumers.\n\nIn New Mexico the company added 2,000 accounts by signing up Primo Beverages. Dan Rosado, Primo\u2019s President, commented, \u201cCelsius is different than most of the products we see in that it has a unique quality and it\u2019s easy to see how consumers would be looking for its calorie burning and energy providing aspects.\u201d\nDan continued\u2026\u201cCelsius is an exciting product for us, from the packaging to the great refreshing taste and functional benefits. We\u2019ve already placed Celsius in some of our leading accounts including Raleys Grocery and many fitness facilities and truly believe it will be a hit with our customers.\u201d\nWhen distributors get excited about a new product you know it is going to be successful.\n\u201cWe believe there is a huge opportunity to address \n\nthe various channels we service. We are convinced \nCelsius has targeted the right consumer.\u201d\n--Fred Losch\n\nExperienced Management \n\nCelsius has a solid management team and they are adding more industry heavy hitters to assure their continued success.\nFor example, Erin Heit was recently appointed Marketing VP. Heit brings solid industry experience from upstarts Fuze and Glaceau Vitaminwater. She has the industry contacts and knows how to grow the company\u2019s revenues.\nI encourage you to read more about the company\u2019s management team on the company\u2019s website. When you do, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they are very capable of making Celsius a company as great as their product.\nExciting Opportunity \n\nLaunched in early 2006, Celsius is rapidly gaining traction in the retail marketplace. But from an investor\u2019s perspective, the company remains below Wall Street analysts\u2019 radar. \nThat\u2019s great, because it\u2019s an opportunity for early investors to make large profits as the stock price moves up, up, up. \nWith distribution underway and expansion across major markets, quarterly revenue and earnings comparisons will be explosive and so will the stock price. \nIn addition, with merger mania running wild across global corporate executive offices and board rooms, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this company and their innovative product was an acquisition target by a major beverage company.\nBut even without a buy-out, the outstanding acceptance of their product along with the broadening of their distribution, it won\u2019t take long for the company to reach sales of $10 million per quarter.\n\nJones was a $317 million dollar company when it reported quarterly sales of $10 million. When Celsius\u2019 sales take off in the near future like I expect them to\u2026the company could easily reach a similar valuation. That would result in the stock exploding to $3.25 a share, or a 225% gain.\nAnd that\u2019s when the company captures only $40 million of sales in a $36 billion market. Longer-term I expect the company could easily surpass Jones\u2019 current market valuation, which would produce an outstanding 549% return when the share price tops $6.50.\nWhen you consider Celsius could be the most important development in the beverage industry since diet soda\u2019s became popular in the 1980\u2019s, you can see why I\u2019m highly recommending adding shares to your portfolio.\nInvest in Celsius Holdings now, before others discover this sparkling beverage industry gem. Early investors could make exceptional profits in the months ahead as consumers drive Celsius\u2019 sales through the roof.\n\n                  If you would like to stay apprised of all future news releases and updates pertaining to Celsius Holdings Inc., please register on my priority news list here.                    \nIf you are interested in undiscovered, undervalued market opportunities like Celsius Holdings, please consider a subscription to my Stock Prospector newsletter. \nInvest Successfully,\n\nEric Dany\nP.S. Celsius is not a replacement for exercise and it is not a weight loss product\u2026but it is a great replacement beverage for people who love the great taste of a soft drink and the energy of an energy drink, without the bad-for-you ingredients.\nP.P.S.
