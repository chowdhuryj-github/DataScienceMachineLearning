I have a\nset of observational (i.e. no fixed experimental effects) data, in which I\nhave identified high and low clusters of the response variable. The design\nis unbalanced, with 773 high cluster observations, and 523 low cluster\nobservations. I would like to test a set of 7 correlates to see if there are\nsignificant differences in their means between the clusters: That is I have\none fixed effect with 2 levels, and a bunch of 7 continuous predictors. I\nbelieve the correct model specification is an ANCOVA design(?)\n\nI can fit this model in MINITAB using, say:\n\nglm response = cluster;\ncovariate predictor1 predictor2 ... predictor7.\n\nIn R, if I specify the model using\n\ncluster<-ordered(clusterlevels=c(\"Low\",\"High\"))\nModel<-lm(predictor~response1+response2+ ... response7+cluster)\n\nI can replicate the results from MINITAB, getting identical P and t values\nwhen I do summary(lm(Model)), but the F values are all different (huge) when\nI do summary(aov(Model)) for all correlates. The F value for the fixed\neffect is correct. The P values for summary(aov(Model)) are all highly\nsignificant too.\n\nI would like to fit the model in R, both for consistency with my other\nanalysis, and because I use R on my home machine, and have to venture into\nthe university labs to use MINITAB.\n\nMany thanks\n\nLuke Spadavecchia\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
