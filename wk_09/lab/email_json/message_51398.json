If you are just trying to convince your boss\nthat the information is \"safe\" then this might be an acceptable\nsolution; however, the information is not safe.  Any attacker could\neasily undo the encryption in a short period of time and if the\nattacker has access to the source code then he/she will be able to\nbreak it instantly.  If there are legal reasons for encrypting the\ndata, then this will not stand up in court as a reasonable attempt to\nsecure the data.\n\n* unless you are using a truly randomly generated one-time-pad that is\nused once and then thrown away, in which case it is the strongest form\nof encryption.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
