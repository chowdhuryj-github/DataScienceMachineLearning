Everitt. :-)\n\nM.J. Crawley only seems to write books using S-PLus and R.  His book on\nStatistical Computing (using S-Plus) is about 750 pages and his book\n\"Statistics: An introduction using R\" is about 320 pages.  \n\nI do not know and have not seen \"The R Book\" yet, so I cannot comment\non it.  The statistical material presented in the other two books is\npretty sound and well explained.  M.J. Crawley definitely has some\nstrong opinions on how certain data should be analysed and how\nstatistics should be used. The S-Plus code or R code he uses can, on\noccasions, be somewhat improved.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tBerwin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
