I'm thinking \"added functionality for semicolon alternatives\"\nrather than the \"replace the semicolon\" stunt that Semi::Semicolons\npulls.  In particular, as long as there's no ambiguity between\nprefix: and postfix:, I think that it would be quite useful for\npostfix: to act as a semicolon that additionally sets $_ equal to\nthe expression's value, allowing for a pseudo-Prolog style of syntax\n(i.e., the code could include questions as well as declarations and\ninstructions).\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
