Got that.  Had to get tpconfig, it wasn't on the machine.\nAm trying to lower the z threshold, it's currently reported at 6 of 7 by \ntpconfig -i.\nHave tried \"tpconfig -Z 4\" but that doesn't do anything. Then tried \n\"tpconfig -Z4\", again nothing.  Then \"tpcofig --threshold 4\".  After \neach attempt tpconfig -i reports\nthat threshold is still at 6\nSuggestions\nJim\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
