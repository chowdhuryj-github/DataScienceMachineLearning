The following code provides some sample\ndata for a scatterplot I am trying to create.  As you can see, I am plotting\nthe values using the row names.\n\nx.sample <- rnorm(10, 50, 2)\ny.sample <- rnorm(10, 50, 1)\nz.names <- 1:10\ndata.example <- data.frame(x.sample, y.sample, z.names)\nrow.names(data.example) <- data.example$z.names\nplot(x.sample, y.sample, type = \"n\", ylab=\"y values\", xlab=\"x values\")\ntext(x = x.sample, y = y.sample, labels = row.names(data.example), cex=.75)\n\nWhat I would like to do now is to bold a few specific values in the plot.\nFor example, what would I need to do in order to recreate this plot but make\nmake points 2, 7, and 8 bold?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-Brian\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
