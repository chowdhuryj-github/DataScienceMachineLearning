I'm not sure off-hand what's\nappropriate for an F-test in this context (and indeed why the default test\nis inappropriate). Can you describe the correct test or supply a reference?\nI suspect that it shouldn't be hard to write a linear.hypothesis method for\ngls objects that fixes up the result returned by linear.hypothesis.default. \n\nYou might take a look at car:::linear.hypothesis.default to see that it does\n-- the computations are pretty straightforward.\n\nI hope this helps,\n John \n\n--------------------------------\nJohn Fox, Professor\nDepartment of Sociology\nMcMaster University\nHamilton, Ontario\nCanada L8S 4M4\n905-525-9140x23604\nhttp://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox \n-------------------------------- \n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Tine Huyghe\n> Sent: Saturday, June 16, 2007 4:19 AM\n> To: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Subject: [R] linear hypothesis test in gls model\n> \n> Dear all,\n> \n> For analysis of a longitudinal data set with fixed \n> measurement in time I built a gls model (nlme).
