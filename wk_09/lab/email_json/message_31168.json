My very limited understanding of the technology tells me that's unlikely,\nbut I'd be glad to be wrong.  If that can't happen, though, then Gene's key complaint, as I read it, stands: software speech is second-rate access, if\nthat's all there is.\n\n> > I make my living as a computer consultant.

He pointed out that if your product doesn't meet the needs he sees he'll use another.  That's rightly\npart of the freedom we claim.  At the very least, it's no less constructive a comment or choice than the decision to remove speakup is.\n\nMy own purpose here is not to bash ubuntu.  As I see it, the worst problem is the failure to include speakup in the vanilla kernel.  Then, the developers\nof neither ubuntu nor any other distro would have to worry about \"unpredictable\" results of including something \"non-standard.\"  I know there was correspondence\non this list in which it was said that the speakup code didn't meet the relevant standards.  (Indeed, there were specific suggestions on revising it.)\nI also know that the grml kernel document I read says that grml uses a vanilla kernel with some patches, and I know speakup is included in those patches.\n (I use it right now largely for that reason.) It seems to me that if the grml folks can include it, then we should probably regard as suspect any \"standard\"\nthat keeps it out of the vanilla kernel.  I'm willing to be corrected, but even realizing how little I know, I doubt that my inference is unreasonable.\n\nAl\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
