Now I want to use the functional form of my model taking estimated\ndegrees of freedoms in step.gam() {gam} to search a better model.\n\nYou know mgcv masks over gam. So i can not use gam after using mgcv. Is\nthere any way to stop mgcv.\n\nQusetion #2\n*********\nSuppose i have three models:\nM1. GAM with thin plate regression spline(TPRS)\nM2. GAM with cubic regression spline(CRS)\nM3. GAM with some TPRS and CRS\n\nTo choose best model among the three, can i use their GCV/AIC/UBRE\ncriterion?\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/two-basic-question-regarding-model-selection-in-GAM-tf3963362.html#a11248016\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
