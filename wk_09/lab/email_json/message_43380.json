There are a few example of this at\nhttp://had.co.nz/ggplot2/coord_equal.html\n\nI am also preparing a chapter for the ggplot book which will discuss\nthis, as well as more general details of customising absolutely every\naspect of ggplot2 with grid.  I hope to have this out by the end of\nthe week - I'll probably send another anouncement to R packages when\nthis is ready.\n\nYou should be able to start using ggplot2 with very little effort,\nespecially if you have been using qplot a lot.\n\nHadley\n\nOn 6/5/07, Ross Boylan  wrote:\n> Is there a way to control the aspect ratio of plots using ggplot?\n> Specifically, I'm using the formula=a~b argument to produce a grid of\n> plots, but the overall width of the result seems to vary for reasons\n> that are obscure to me.\n>\n> This affects not only the appearance of the plots but the amount of\n> space available for the title (which seems to be right justified\n> relative to the right edge of the grid).\n>\n> I've tried tweaking some parameters in the past, but they had no effect\n> that I could tell.\n>\n> Perhaps related to that, my previous attempts to use abline to produce a\n> 45 degree angle always produced a flat straight line.\n>\n> There are also a bunch of other tweaks I want to make to get output\n> presentation ready.
