I assume that A and B are not the\nobservations but the corresponding time stamps, right?\n\nIn any case, I guess that the \"zoo\" package will have some useful\nfunctionality for what you want, e.g., if you have data like\n  library(\"zoo\")\n  set.seed(123)\n  x <- zoo(rnorm(11), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + 0:10)\n  y <- zoo(rnorm(4), as.Date(\"2000-01-01\") + c(0, 3, 7, 10))\nthen you can merge them with\n  z <- merge(x, y)\nand then eliminate NAs, e.g. by\n  na.locf(z)\nor you could aggregate() the \"x\" series so that it becomes a monthly\nseries or something like that.\n\nSee\n  vignette(\"zoo\", package = \"zoo\")\nfor more information.\n\nBest,\nZ\n\n> For all A[i], i = 1,...,N and B[j], j=1,...M\n>\n> Match with B[j] where A[i] <= B[j]\n>\n> When A[i] > B[j], match with B[j+1] where A[i] <= B[j+1]\n>\n> Basically the less-frequent attributes stay true for a stock while the\n> daily prices change.\n>\n> One example of this is the vlookup function in Excel with the TRUE\n> option.\n>\n> So we have an implementation of this in R?\n>\n> TIA and best,\n> -Tir\n>\n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
