Then you pick the \\beta and A corresponding to\nmaximum of the profiled likelihood.  However, this set of A and \\beta need\nnot necessarily satisfy your constraints.  If this does happen, you could\nmake a simple parameter transformation from (A, beta) to (P1, P2) that might\nresolve the problem:\n\nP1 <- beta\nP2 <- atanh(A + beta)\n\nRavi.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n\nRavi Varadhan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, The Center on Aging and Health\n\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology \n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nPh: (410) 502-2619\n\nFax: (410) 614-9625\n\nEmail: rvaradhan@jhmi.edu\n\nWebpage:  http://www.jhsph.edu/agingandhealth/People/Faculty/Varadhan.html\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Leeds, Mark (IED)\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2007 10:29 AM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] Time series\\optimization question not R question\n\nThis is a time series\\optimization rather than an R question : Suppose I\nhave an ARMA(1,1) with\nrestrictions such that the coefficient on the lagged epsilon_term is\nrelated to the coefficient on\nThe lagged z term as below.\n\nz_t =[A + beta]*z_t-1 + epsilon_t - A*epsilon_t-1\n\nSo, if I don't have a facility for optimizing with this restriction, is\nit legal to set A to something and then\nOptimize just for the beta given the A ? Would this give me the same\nanswer likelihood wise, of optimizing both\njointly with the restriction ? This methodology doesn't sound right to\nme. Thanks.\n\nP.S : abs(A + beta) also has to be less than 1  but I was just going to\nhope for that and not worry about it right now.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy/se...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
