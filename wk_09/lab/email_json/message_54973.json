Our jets provide business travelers with plenty of room \nto refresh themselves and focus on business results rather than business travel. \nYour staff will experience comfortable seating, large and convenient work \nsurfaces and exceptional acoustic soundproofing.\n  The Pilots\n\n  Like all facets of our business, our pilot selection standards are \nunsurpassed as part of Redijet\u2019s commitment to maintain an impeccable level of safety for our clients.\nRedijet\u2019s crewmember selection process is very demanding and assures that only the very best pilots are selected to be the front line ambassadors for Redijet. All of our crewmembers are FAA captain qualified, trained by nationally recognized training organizations Simcom, Simuflite, and Flight Safety. This training is accompanied by our own company training that covers such aspects as safety and security for our clients as well as all other pertinent company related subjects.\nHow did we get such great pilots? The standards of our organization, our perfect safety record, disciplined aircraft maintenance, and reputation for service are a draw to conscientious pilots. The best pilots are also drawn to Redijet for some of the same reasons you are: a chance to be more in control of their travel schedule than major airlines permit, getting home to families or loved ones at the end of a day, and a more personal and engaging way of serving customers who they come to regard as friends.\nOur Service\nWhether you need to connect to your business or your next destination, our professional and capable customer service representatives and energetic concierge staff will ensure that your trip begins and ends well.\nTechnical Securities Data \nCompany Symbol: RJTI \n  Exchage: Pinksheets\n  Number Shareholders: 602\n  Shares Outstanding: 1,374,513\n  Website: www.redijet.com\n  IR Firm: www.qwoter.com\n  Shareholder Info Package: www.redijet.com/ivestors/Redijet.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n99 Signature Place\nLebanon, Tennessee 37087 \n\nPhone: (877)-I-FLY-VIP  \nWebsite: www.redijet.com\n\nEmail: info@redijet.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t  Summit Entertainment Group14435 FM 2920 - Tombal, TX 77377 US\n\t  \n\n\n"}
