It wouldn't be too difficult to recode \ngap.plot to get more than one break. I'll see what I can do today.\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
