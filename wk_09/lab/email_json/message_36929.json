There's no easy way to test these \nfunctions through PIR or the external API, so the test is fairly decent.\n\nA better test would link all of the necessary .c files (mostly just \nsrc/intlist.c) into a full application, without linking against libparrot \ndynamically.\n\nHowever, we don't have a test function that does that.\n\nYour task is to build one.\n\nThis may necessitate figuring out how to save the relevant \"How do I invoke \nthe compiler?\" magic from the Makefile into a separate program or \nconfiguration file or Perl module somewhere.\n\n"}
