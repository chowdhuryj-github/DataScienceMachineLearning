The subject didn't change.\n\nYou used the /x modifier which allows for comments within regular \nexpressions. Remove /x, and the old regex will work as expected.\n\nRead \"perldoc perlre\" too.\n\nYou also could have written it this way:\n\nopen AUTHFILE, \";\nclose AUTHFILE;\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
