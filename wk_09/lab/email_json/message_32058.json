So I think this function is not \nfor me since long-tailed samples aren't normally distribuited (right?!)\n\nI've found the Marsaglia article (\"Evaluating the Anderson Darling \ndistribution\") where it seems I can consider the ECDF (empirical CDF) \nand the theoretical as a uniformly [0,1] distributed data and then \nperform the test like I had to compare two uniform distribution. The \nproblem is the theoretical CDF ( i.e. the parameters of theoretical \ndistribution) has been estimated from the data against which I want to \nmake the test. I've read somewhere it's not a good technique to compare \nthe distribution with the above way because the resulting AD test might \nbe biased.\n\nSo, finally, I don't know how to proceed ...\n\nCan anyone give me a help or any reference (please remember I'm not a \nstatistician so do not write too technically)??\n\nThanks a lot to everyone!!\n\n-- Marco\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
