I think it is an easy to use \nprotocol and maybe some other games or activities want to use it as well.\n\nAn osc message consists of an OSC address pattern (a path) followed by \nan OSC type tag string followed by zero or more OSC arguments.\n\n'/MEMOSONO/test', 'ifs', [1, 3.4, 'test']\n\nosc is callback based. On the receiver side the osc path and the type \ntag is used to dispatch the right callback.\n\nA python implementation of the osc protocol and a basic api for \nreceiving and sending osc messages can be found in the memosono tree in \nthe osc folder. There exist python bindings for the osc library liblo as \nwell (http://das.nasophon.de/pyliblo/).\n\nBest,\n    Simon\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
