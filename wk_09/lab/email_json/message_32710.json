I thought that help file said that only pdf and MacOSX quartz would work (at the time it was written).\n\nIt certainly does not work for me on the screen.\n\nBtw, I made an error in writing the previous e-mail: the command to convert to .eps from .ps is ps2epsi.\n\nMany thanks and best wishes,\nRanjan\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
