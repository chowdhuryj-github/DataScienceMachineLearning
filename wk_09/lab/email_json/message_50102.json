Two questions:\n\n1. Would something similar work for extracting selected functions\n   from a library (assuming that you know about interdependencies)?\n\n   E.g. something like\n\n  f <- local({\n       library(f.etc.lib)\n       environment(f) <- .GlobalEnv\n       f\n  })\n\n\n2. Having done what you describe to extract just f from a source\n   file, can one then \"delete\" the local environment used to load\n   the source? I think what I'm basically asking is whether the\n   exporting is done \"by value\" (local environment deletion OK)\n   or \"by reference\" (deletion would destroy the exported object).\n\nApologies, but for instance \"?local\" is a bit too deep for me!\n\nThe underlying agenda behind these queries is the saving of\nmemory space.\n\nWith theanks,\nTed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 18-Jun-07                                       Time: 17:11:15\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
