I have referred to this number as \"meld\"--model for end stage\nliver disease--which is the result of a mathematical calculation on\nunderlying laboratory values. So, for example, I can generate a Kaplan-Meier\nplot of patients undergoing a TIPS procedure with the following:\n\n>plot(survfit(Surv(days,status==1),subset(tips,meld<10)) \n\nwhere \"tips\" is my data set, \"days\" is the number of days alive, and meld is\nthe meld score.\n\nWhat I would like to do is display the survival graphs of patients with\nmeld<10, 1020. I am unsure about how to go about this.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nGreg\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
