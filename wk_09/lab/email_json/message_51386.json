You can dothis with:\nd2 = data.frame(t(Test[,-1]))colnames(d2) = Test[,1]  #now use d2\n\n > Now I try to perform a similarity analysis with the dsvdis function  > of the labdsv package with the sorensen-Index.> > My first question is if all zeros in my table are seen as missing  > values and if it islike that how can I change without turning zero  > into other numbers?\nno - the zeros are valid observations.  the na's are missing data.\n\n>   DisTest<-dsvdis(Test, index = \"sorensen\")> > But I always get back this error message:> > Warnung in symbol.For(\"dsvdis\") :'symbol.For' is not needed: please  > remove it> Fehler in dsvdis(Test, index = \"sorensen\") :> \tNA/NaN/Inf in externem Funktionsaufruf (arg 1)> Zus\u00e4tzlich: Warning message:> NAs durch Umwandlung erzeugt\n\n\nSecond - you have an issue with missing data.  It looks like dsvdis does notlike the NA's - so you must make a decision about what to do.  Delete thatspecies, delete that site, or whatever...\nFinally - the warning over symbol.For is an issue with the labdsv library itself- nothing you are doing wrong.  The results will still be valid - but the use ofsymbol.For is something that will eventually need to be changed in the labdsvlibrary.\nhth,\nstephen\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
