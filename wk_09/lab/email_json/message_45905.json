I wrote a script that involves long computational time (although, during the calculation, it spits out text on the gui to notify me the progress of the calculation periodically). Windows vista always stopped my calculation and claimed that 'Rgui is stop-working. Windows is checking for solution.' And when I looked into task manager, windows already stopped my Rgui process. I am quite disappointed with this. I would really appreciate if anyone finds a solution to go around this windows vista problem? Particularly, how to turn off this feature in vista? Any help would be really appreciated. Thank you!- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
