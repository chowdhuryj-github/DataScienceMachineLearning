I was typing on \nfreedombox with key echo on and had awl sorts of transpositions and \nmissing spaces. Tried to do another email and the same thing was \nhappening. I have to use freedobox mail because somehow emails to me \nfrom this list and some others are bouncing on my Charter account. \nTurned off key echo and now everything seems to be fine; don't know if \nit was something in freedobox Key echo, my keyboard, or what. \nAdmittedly I didn't spellcheck before sending but my spelling isn't THAT bad!!!\n\nI have a friend who suddenly can not log in as root. She can log in \nwith her normal user password or with mine; I  have an account on her \nbox and maintain it for her. But logging in as root fails both from the \nconsole login prompt and with su; she doesn't appear to have sudo. I've \nchecked that she's using the correct password and that caps lock is \noff. Does anybody either have an idea what might have caused this or \nhow we can solve the problem so she can log in as root? She can't fetch \npackages because she's using root to start her ppp connection. She \nhasn't upgraded for a while so it's not some new package she added \ncausing the problem.\nThanks for any help and sorry again about the last post; I checked it \nthis time but now i'm paranoid!!!\n\n-- \nEmail services by FreedomBox.
