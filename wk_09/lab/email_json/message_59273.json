Not \"being a fan\" is too vague.\n\nIMO the client side is the perfect place to do much of\nthis stuff and if \"winbind use default domain\" had been in\nthe client code to begin with, winbindd itself would have\nhad many fewer bugs wrt to name translation.\n\nAlso doing combination operations like this prevent the\nwinbindd API from inheriting esoteric calls.  Why add a\nnew call to the API when you can write a wrapper around\nto existing calls.  Given that pam_winbind is not\nperformance critical, as long as we don't introduce\ninappropriate delays, this should be fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGht5OIR7qMdg1EfYRAo4BAKCFC+XmXDRIcwZrT49DDKF13VrtmgCff10S\nOCHyeCcXQtFyyoz3Gytyg5o=\n=2c0D\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
