The experiment compares two conditions (light vs. dark). we would like to use a mixed-model ANOVA but we don't know much about it. could you please help?\nthe experiment test the effect of light on a tissue and compare tissues maintained in light or dark (fixed effect).\nIn each condition, Two RNA samples were used (random effect?) for each condition, and each sample was measured twice (random effect? nested in sample?), or maybe the replicate factor is not required?\n\nAny help will be appreciated (particularly on how to assign the random factor(s) )\n\nfor a given gene the data look like that:\n\nlight  RNA  replicate  reading\n\"y\"     1     1          1.67\n\"y\"     1     2          1.56\n\"y\"     2     1          1.60\n\"y\"     2     2          1.34\n\"n\"     1     1          1.67\n\"n\"     1     2          1.56\n\"n\"     2     1          1.60\n\"n\"     2     2          1.34\n\n\n\n\n***************************************************************\nThis email was sent via http://www.AnonymousSpeech.com,  \nthe worlds leading anonymous email provider.\nPaid memberships do not show this footer message.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
