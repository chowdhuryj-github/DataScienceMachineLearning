Reid\" <rreid@sunset.net>", "subject": "DECpc is silent", "body": "I have installed a DEC PC card in a Celeron system running Slackware\n11.0 and kernel 2.4.33.3.  I have recompiled the kernel to include the\ndecpc module as well as to make it more specific for the Celeron CPU.\nI downloaded the dtload.tgz package and installed it.  Without dtload,\nmodprobe reported the decpc address as 0x250, so I changed the address\nin the dec_pc.conf file to match this value.  Running 'dtload -v'\nindicates that the card is found and that the software is loaded into\nit.  Running 'modprobe speakup_decpc' produces no errors, and\n/proc/speakup/synth_name contains the name decpc as expected.  No\nmatter what volume setting I put in /proc/speakup/vol, the DECpc card\nremains silent.\n\nAny suggestions which might help me get this card talking would be\nappreciated.  Thanks, and have a great day.\n\n-- \nRalph.  N6BNO.
