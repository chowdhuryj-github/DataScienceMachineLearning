It's mainly in dbwrap_ctdb.c, ctdbd_conn.c and\nmessages_ctdbd.c.\n\nThere should be no changes to the non-cluster case, it does survive make\ntest on my laptop.\n\nIt survives some very basic tests with ctdbd enables, I did not do the\nfull test suite for clusters yet.\n\nPhew...\n\nVolker\n\n\nAdded:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/ctdbd_conn.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/packet.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/ctdbd_conn.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/dbwrap_ctdb.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/messages_ctdbd.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/packet.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/ctdbd_conn.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/packet.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/ctdbd_conn.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/dbwrap_ctdb.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/messages_ctdbd.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/packet.c\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/Makefile.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/configure.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/includes.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/messages.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/smb.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/dbwrap.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/messages.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/substitute.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/util.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/librpc/ndr/ndr_misc.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/nsswitch/winbindd_dual.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/param/loadparm.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/script/tests/tests_all.sh\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/oplock.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/smbd/server.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/utils/status.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/Makefile.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/configure.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/includes.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/messages.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/smb.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/dbwrap.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/messages.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/substitute.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/util.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/librpc/ndr/ndr_misc.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/nsswitch/winbindd_dual.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/param/loadparm.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/smbd/oplock.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/smbd/server.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/utils/status.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (5604 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23410\n\n"}
