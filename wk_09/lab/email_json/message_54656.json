I did not try to implement the changes proposed by Hadley, hoping that a solution can be found using the original dataset.\n######### My code\n# Creating dataset\nnPts<-10            # number of time pointsnInd<-6              # number of individualsnModel<-3         # number of models\nTimePts<-rep(1:nPts,nInd*nModel)                                    # creates the \"Time\" columnCoef<-rep(rnorm(6,0.1,0.01),each=nPts,nModel)             # Creates a vector of coefficients for generating the observationsObs<-10*exp(-Coef*TimePts)                                         # creates the observations\nfor (i in 1:60){Pred[i]<-jitter(10*exp(-Coef[i]*TimePts[i]))Pred[i+60]<-jitter(5)Pred[i+120]<-jitter(10-Coef[i+120]*TimePts[i])}                                                                                          # creates the predicted values\ncolPlot<-rep(1,nPts*nInd*nModel)                                           # creates the \"Plot\" columncolModel<-gl(nModel,nPts*nInd,labels=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"))             # creates the \"Model\" columncolID<-gl(nInd,nPts,nPts*nInd*nModel)                                       # creates the \"ID\" column\nmydata<-data.frame(colPlot,colModel,colID,TimePts,Obs,Pred)                            # creates the datasetnames(mydata)<-c(\"Plot\",\"Model\",\"Individuals\",\"Time\",\"Observed\",\"Predicted\")\n# Plotting as indicated by Deepayan\nxyplot(Observed + Predicted ~ Time | Individuals + Model,      data = mydata,      panel = panel.superpose.2, type = c(\"p\", \"l\"),      layout = c(0, nlevels(mydata$Individuals))) #,      #<...>)\n####### End of code\nThis codes is not exactly what I am looking for, although it is pretty close. In the present case, I would like to have a Trellis plot with 6 panels (one for each individual), where the Observations and the Predicted are plotted as symbols and lines, respectively. All three models should be plotted on the same panel. Unfortunately, it looks to me as 3 successives xyplots are created by the code above but only the last one remains displayed. I tried to play with panel.superpose,panel.superpose.2 and type, without much success.\nI also tried the following code that creates 18 panels and distinguish all (Individuals,Model) couples... so, not what I want.\nxyplot(Observed + Predicted ~ Time | Individuals+Model, data = mydata,     type = c(\"p\", \"l\"), distribute.type = TRUE)\nSebastien\n\nDeepayan Sarkar a \u00e9crit :> On 6/21/07, S\u00e9bastien  wrote:>> Hi Hadley,>>>> Hopefully, my dataset won't be too hard to changed.
