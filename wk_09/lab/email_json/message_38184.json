SANCTIONS FOR SUDAN: President Bush has decided to implement a plan to pressure\nSudan's government into cooperating with international efforts to halt the violence in its troubled Darfur region,\nwhere his administration said almost three years ago that genocide was taking place. Administration officials said\nyesterday that the Treasury Department will step up efforts to squeeze the Sudanese economy by targeting government-run\nventures involved with its booming oil business, which does many of its transactions in U.S. dollars. Bush will\nsanction two senior Sudanese officials and a rebel leader, who are suspected of being involved in the violence in\nDarfur. The United States will also seek new U.N. Security Council sanctions against Khartoum, as well as a provision\npreventing the Sudanese government from conducting military flights in Darfur. Washington Post: Bush Looks To Intensify\nPressure On Sudan http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/28/AR2007052801439.html\n\nMAJOR IRAQ GOALS \"CONSIDERED A LONG SHOT\" TO BE COMPLETED BY SEPT.: U.S. military leaders in Iraq are increasingly\nconvinced that most of the broad political goals President Bush laid out early this year in his announcement of a troop\nbuildup will not be met this summer and are seeking ways to redefine success. In September, Army Gen. David H.\nPetraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, is scheduled to present Congress with an assessment of progress in Iraq.\nMilitary officers in Baghdad and outside advisors working with Petraeus doubt that the three major goals set by U.S.\nofficials for the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki will be achieved by then. Enactment of a new law to\nshare Iraq's oil revenue among Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish regions is the only goal they think might be achieved in time,\nand even that is considered a long shot. The two other key benchmarks are provincial elections and a deal to allow more\nSunni Arabs into government jobs.

The Iranians did\nnot respond to the arms charge, Crocker said in a conference call with reporters after the four-hour meeting in\nBaghdad, but offered their own proposal to establish formal security cooperation between the United States, Iran, and\nthe Iraqi government. The meeting ended with Crocker saying that President Bush and his senior advisers would decide\nhow to respond to Iran's proposal and with the Iranians reserving the right to respond to the weapons charge at a later\ndate. Despite the lack of a major breakthrough, both sides described the meeting between Crocker and Iranian Ambassador\nHassan Kazemi Qomi in positive terms. Boston Globe: Talks called positive as US asks Iran for help on Iraq\nhttp://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2007/05/29/talks_called_positive_as_us_asks_iran_for_help_on_iraq/\n\nIS COAL THE KEY TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE? Even as Congressional leaders draft legislation to reduce greenhouse gases\nlinked to global warming, a powerful roster of Democrats and Republicans is pushing to subsidize coal as the king of\nalternative fuels. Prodded by intense lobbying from the coal industry, lawmakers from coal states are proposing that\ntaxpayers guarantee billions of dollars in construction loans for coal-to-liquid production plants, guarantee minimum\nprices for the new fuel, and guarantee big government purchases for the next 25 years. With both House and Senate\nDemocrats hoping to pass \"energy independence\" bills by mid-July, coal supporters argue that coal-based fuels are more\nAmerican than gasoline and potentially greener than ethanol. New York Times: Lawmakers Push for Big Subsidies for Coal\nProcess http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/business/29coal.html\n\nNO WORLD BANK POST FOR FRIST: Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has withdrawn his name from consideration for\nWorld Bank president, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Monday. Frist, a Tennessee\nRepublican, served two terms in the U.S. Senate, where he was a close ally to President Bush. World Bank President Paul\nWolfowitz earlier this month announced he will step down June 30, his leadership undermined after he broke bank rules\nin his handling of a generous compensation package for his girlfriend, bank employee Shaha Riza, in 2005. Frist told\nadministration officials Monday that he did not want to be considered for the top job at the bank, citing his desire to\ntake a break from government work, said the source who asked not to be identified because he had not been authorized to\nspeak publicly about the decision.

Supporters of the bill say it's just what Bush needs to be doing as he seeks\napproval of the bill. Opponents agree - but see it as a mere public relations exercise... The trip to the Federal Law\nEnforcement Training Center in Glynco will put Bush in the home state of two GOP senators - Saxby Chambliss and Johnny\nIsakson - who are under fire from constituents for their part in negotiating the bill. In particular, it was Isakson's\nidea to condition the bill's reforms, including providing a route to legal residency for illegal immigrants, to meeting\ngoals for border security.

Most Americans want Congress to fix a system\nthey regard as broken even though they have reservations about the proposed legislation, McConnell said in an interview\non Bloomberg Television's \"Political Capital with Al Hunt.\" Public opinion, he predicted, will trump such specific\nconcerns as whether it amounts to amnesty to grant eventual legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants\nin the U.S. \"This is a divisive issue\" for both parties, said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. But, he said, \"I don't\nthink there's a single member of either party next year who is going to fail to be re-elected over this issue.\"\nBloomberg: McConnell Says Immigration Doesn't Hurt Lawmakers' Re-Election\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aAmHAHTddF84\n\n\"I HAVE LEARNED SOME NEW WORDS FROM SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS,\" SAYS KYL: Angry calls poured into Senator Jon Kyl's\noffice this week by the thousands, expressing outrage beyond anything he said he had witnessed in his 20-year political\ncareer. The callers were inflamed by Mr. Kyl's role in shaping the bipartisan immigration compromise announced May 17,\nwhich lawmakers continue to debate. \"Yes, I have learned some new words from some of my constituents,\" Mr. Kyl, an\nArizona Republican, said at a news conference on Thursday, drawing titters from those in the room. Mr. Kyl, 65, who\ngarners top ratings from conservative groups every year, is the unlikely linchpin to the fragile alliance of Democrats\nand Republicans trying to push the sprawling immigration bill through the Senate. New York Times: Change on Immigration\nTurns Senator Kyl Into Lightning Rod http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/washington/29kyl.html\n\nDOES AMERICA CARE ABOUT '08 YET? We have failed you. Or you have failed us. One of the two. For months and months -- it\nonly seems like years and years -- we have been bringing you information about the people running for president of the\nUnited States. We have written story after story, done interview after interview. We have brought you debates with\nstages as crowded as basketball courts. And the candidates have appeared on real news shows, fake news shows and late\nnight comedy shows...  So how are they doing? Are they getting recognized more today than they were before they started\ntheir intensive campaigning and we started giving them constant attention? Nah. According to a Gallup Poll conducted\nthis month: \"Despite the remarkably early start on this year's presidential campaign and the high-visibility presence\nof the major candidates on television news shows and in televised debates, the name identification of the leading\ncandidates or potential candidates has not changed much so far this year.\" The Politico: To know them is to dislike\nthem http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4223.html\n\nSECRET SERVICE STRETCHED THIN: The U.S. Secret Service expects to borrow more than 2,000 immigration officers and\nfederal airport screeners next year to help guard an ever-expanding field of presidential candidates, while shifting\n250 of its own agents from investigations to security details. Burdened by the White House's wartime security needs,\nthe persistent threat of terrorism and a field of at least 20 presidential contenders, the Secret Service was showing\nsigns of strain even before the Department of Homeland Security ordered protection for Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as of\nMay 3, the earliest a candidate has ever been assigned protection in an election season. Washington Post: Campaign Puts\nNew Strain on Secret Service http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/28/AR2007052801159.html\n\nSTUDENTS FOR OBAMA NEARLY DOUBLES IN SIZE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS: The presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama is\nsuccessfully tapping into the youth vote energized by opposition to the Iraq war, as his burgeoning Students for Obama\nmovement has almost doubled its presence on the nation's college campuses in the past few weeks. Students for Obama was\none of the groups that participated in drafting the senator from Illinois into the Democratic presidential race. The\ngroup is now an in-house arm of the \"Obama for America\" campaign. Since the start of last month, the group has grown\nfrom 160 chapters across the country to about 300 and doesn't plan to lose steam after the school year. \"Over the\nsummer, we are committed to making sure that the students remain engaged, and we will organize going door to door to\nget the word out about the senator,\" said Meredith Segal, 21, executive director of Students for Obama.

He doesn't put his worn socks in with the dirty clothes. He's worse than a 5-year-old at making the bed.\nAnd after he eats, he doesn't put away the butter. \"Today, he still didn't put the butter up after he made his\nbreakfast. I was like, 'You're just asking for it, you know I'm giving a speech. Why don't you just put the butter\nup?'\" she told a roaring crowd at a recent Chicago fundraiser for women backing her husband's campaign.

Obama said putting in place universal health coverage has been debated for\ndecades, but the time has finally come to act. He said his plan could save the average consumer $2,500 a year and bring\nhealth care to all. \"The time has come for universal, affordable health care in America,\" Obama said in remarks\nprepared for delivery at the unveiling of his plan Tuesday in Iowa City. AP via Yahoo! News: Obama calls for universal\nhealth care http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070529/ap_on_el_pr/obama_health\n\nTHE NEW RUDY... A BIT NICER: The dyspeptic, \"not afraid to suggest his opponents have really deep-seated psychological\nproblems\" Republican mayor of fact and legend has taken a holiday. What's left on the presidential campaign trail is a\ncommanding daddy of a candidate, a disciplined fellow who talks about terrorism and fiscal order and about terrorism\nsome more. Mr. Giuliani laughs, he gestures expansively, he even pokes fun at his tendency to wax a wee bit\nauthoritarian. (He suggests a touch of the cane was necessary to impose discipline on that liberal asylum known as New\nYork.) He shakes hands with reporters he once viewed as \"jerky\" and assures them he is fine with tough questions about\nabortion, where he has settled on a position supporting a woman's right to choose, and about gun control, where is he\nat least halfway into a policy back-flip.
