I want to display the\nreturns with a barplot, which I can fix easily. But my problem is labaling\nthe x-axis, if I use the positions from the timeseries It gets very messy. I\nhave tried rotating and changing the font size but it doesn't do the trick.\nI think the optimal solution for my purpose is too only display every second\nor third date, pherhaps only use every 12 month. But how do I do that?\n\nThanks Tom\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Barplots%3A-Editing-the-frequency-x-axis-names-tf3888029.html#a11021315\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
