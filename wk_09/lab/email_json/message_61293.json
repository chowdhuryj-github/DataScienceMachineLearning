Someone came up with a list of ten small programs in\npython, each introducing a core part of the language. This was added\nto the wiki over at - http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms . It\nnow contains programs in incresing no. of lines of code.\n\nThat's a great way to quickly get up to speed on the feel and ways of\na language. Please do take a look and something like this for Perl\nwould be brilliant! :)\nSince, I'm still getting to know the ropes, i thought i'd drop in this\nrequest.\n\nCiao and thx\nAlex\n\n\n\nOn Jul 3, 6:31 am, mer...@stonehenge.com (Randal L.
