I couldn't find it in the manual or by searching on\nline. I am wondering if I could ask for some help in this community.\n\n\n\nI am trying to record the results of my program to a csv file in the hard\ndrive so as to save memory space and also to read the results in excel after\nrunning the program.  Every loop of my program will result in a list with\nelement belonging to different class. For example, things like\n\n\n\na1 <- list(name=\"Fred\", wife=\"Mary\", no.children=3)\na2 <- list(name=\"Tom\", wife=\"Joy\", no.children=9)\na3 <- list(name=\"Paul\", wife=\"Alic\", no.children=5)\n\n\n\nI want the columns to have titles, in the example above, I want to see the\ntitle \"name\", \"wife\" and \"no.children\" in the excel file.\n\n\n\nTo set up the table in the csv file, I need to add at least one row in the\ntable up front. How ever, I do not have the first loop of the program\ncompleted yet at that time. If I add a row that is meaningless, how may I\ndelete it after all the loops are completed and all the meaningful rows are\nadded to the table?\n\n\n\nBest Wishes\n\nYuchen Luo\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
