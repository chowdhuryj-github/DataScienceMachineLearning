Use 'optimize'\n      instead.\n\nNext, there is a constraint of x>=0 that you are not imposing.\n\nFinally, it is easy to see that qnorm(0.7, 0.0032, x) is monotome in x, so \nthe solution is x=0.  In fact, x1 = 0.0032 + sqrt(x) * qnorm(0.7).\n\noptim(0.0207, fr)  does a good enough job, as does\noptimize(fr, low=0, up=0.05)\n\n\nAdvice: numerical optimization is not a black box, and has to be used with \nsome analysis of the problem to hand.  See e.g. MASS4, chapter 16.\n\n\nOn Mon, 18 Jun 2007, livia wrote:\n\n>\n> Hi, I would like to minimize the value of x1-x2, x2 is a fixed value of 0.01,\n> x1 is the quantile of normal distribution (0.0032,x) with probability of\n> 0.7, and the changing value should be x.
