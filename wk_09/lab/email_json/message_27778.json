Register now: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewAssemblyActiveContests. \n\nHere are the individual competitions, with a total of $22,500 in prizes (plus Digital Run placement points):\n* ARS Rendering ($1,750.00)\n* ARS Review Pages ($2,250.00)\n* ARS Graphs ($2,500.00)\n* ARS Listing/Loading Pages ($1,500.00)\n* ARS Scores ($1,750.00)\n* ARS Paragraphs ($2,000.00)\n* ARS Security ($1,250.00)\n* ARS Publishing ($2,000.00)\n\nCan you really make money with the Digital Run Assembly Cup? Let's break down the numbers, with the ARS contests as an example:\n\n* Eight Assembly Competitions\n* $22,500 in total prizes\n* 22,500 Digital Run Assembly Cup placement points\n\nAfter looking at the ARS posting, you think you can probably handle the technology, so you sign up. After working through them, you submit for half of the eight competitions. Three of your four submission pass review, and you get one second place and two thirds. Not that great, right?\n\nWrong. With your second place, you'd get an average of over a $900 prize. More importantly, you'd earn something like 1,500 placement points, and gain serious ground on the leaderboard. More details on how the scoring works are available here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=digital_run&d2=2007dot5&d3=asmOverview\n\nLook back at last stage's development cup, for example -- particularly the bottom half. There's a big number of people there who seem to dip into competitions, try them once or twice, then move on, for whatever reason. \n\nTo earn money in the Digital Run -- a share of $90,000 for Assembly -- you don't need to be a superstar. You just need to be a little more persistent than the folks who wind up in the bottom half of the leaderboard. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nGood luck! \n\n- The TopCoder Software Team\n\n\n===================================================================\nYou have received this email because you indicated in your TopCoder profile that you want to be notified of new TopCoder development opportunities.
