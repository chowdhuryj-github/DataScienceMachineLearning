Panel data is quite specific in that it's the\nsame subject being tracked over time.\nA VAR doesn't take advantage of this and doesn't make that assumption\nand I don't think it's applicable to\nYour problem. I think there is a book by\nHsaio on panel data and possibly another one by Arellano ( spelling )\nbut I'm not sure what's available in R for doing panel\ndata estimation. I've never done it. Maybe do a search for \"panel data\"\non the search engine and something may come up ?\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Megh Dal\nSent: Tuesday, June 12, 2007 12:12 PM\nTo: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: [R] Panel data\n\nDear all R users,\n\nI have a small doubt about panel data analysis. My basic understanding\non Panel data is a type of data that is collected over time and\nsubjects. Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) model used on this type of\ndata. Therefore can I say that, one of statistical tools used for\nanalysis of panel data is VAR model? If you clarify my doubt I will be\nvery grateful.\n\nThanks and regards,\nMegh\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n____________\nLooking for earth-friendly autos? \nBrowse Top Cars by \"Green Rating\" at Yahoo!
