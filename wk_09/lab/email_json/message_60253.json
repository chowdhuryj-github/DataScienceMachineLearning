The voice can tell me a lot while my feedback is\nvery limited.\n\nOr, take your common dumb temperature control: you have a box with two\nbuttons and a simple LCD display which can show only two digits.  Yet,\nnowadays everything tends to have a chip inside -- and if anything inside\nhas anything to do with GPLv3, you suddenly need to convey the legal\nnotices...\n\n\nMy point is that the requirement of every interactive interface having a\nfeature to display the legal notices can be a severe use constraint.\n\n-- \n1KB\t\t// Microsoft corollary to Hanlon's razor:\n\t\t//\tNever attribute to stupidity what can be\n\t\t//\tadequately explained by malice.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
