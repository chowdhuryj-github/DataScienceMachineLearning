This seems like the same situation reported recently on the  \nthread \"R-2.4.1 for MacOS X - languageR, acepack, Hmisc\":\n\n> > library(Hmisc)\n> Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :\n> \tunable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ \n> Versions/2.4/Resources/library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so':\n>   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/ \n> library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so, 6): Library not loaded: /usr/ \n> local/gcc4.0/lib/libgfortran.0.dylib\n>   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/ \n> Resources/library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so\n>   Reason: image not found\n> Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Hmisc'\n\nI searched for and found the library complained about: \"libgfortran. \n0.dylib\".  Then from the unix terminal I created a link to where  \nHmisc expected it to be located.  Attempting library(Hmisc) again,  \ngot me past the initial error, but resulted in another library not  \nfound in a different location:\n\n> > library(Hmisc)\n> Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :\n> \tunable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ \n> Versions/2.4/Resources/library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so':\n>   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/ \n> library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so, 6): Library not loaded: /usr/ \n> local/gcc4.0/i686-apple-darwin8/lib/libgcc_s.1.0.dylib\n>   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/ \n> Resources/library/Hmisc/libs/i386/Hmisc.so\n>   Reason: image not found\n> Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Hmisc'\n\nI can find the library named \"libgcc_s.1.0.dylib\" but I'm not sure  \nthat this is of the i686 flavor which it appears to need or if that  \nmatters.\n\nUltimately, it appears that the libraries Hmisc needs are either not  \npresent or not where Hmisc expects them to be.  I do have the Apple  \nDeveloper Tools installed.  Any suggestions?\n\nThanks,\n-David\n\n> > version\n>                _\n> platform       i386-apple-darwin8.8.1\n> arch           i386\n> os             darwin8.8.1\n> system         i386, darwin8.8.1\n> status\n> major          2\n> minor          4.1\n> year           2006\n> month          12\n> day            18\n> svn rev        40228\n> language       R\n> version.string R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)\n\n\n----------------------------------\nDavid Daniel\nAssociate Professor\nUniversity Statistics Center\nNew Mexico State University\n\nddaniel@nmsu.edu\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
