The court case pitted JASRAC, the Japanese\norganization that collects fees for public music performances, against\nImage City, whose MYUTA service lets users employ a central server to\nstore songs from their own CDs, to play on their own phones. The Tokyo\nDistrict Court handed down a [0]ruling declaring Image City guilty of\ncopyright infringement (Google translation). Despite the music being\nstored strictly for personal use, the ruling reasoned that the act of\nuploading music to a central server owned by a company is the equivalent\nof distributing music to that company.
