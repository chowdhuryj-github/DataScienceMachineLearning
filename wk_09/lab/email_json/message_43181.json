When you do\nthis and see that you have sound again, just do an \n\naumix -S \n\nto save the settings to the master aumixrc file.  This should  correct\nthe sound problem if aumix runs at boot time with this as its\nconfiguration file.  \n\n\n\nHope this helps. \n\n\n\n\n-- \nSpie Smith: C.S.F.C.\nComputer Scientist For CHRIST\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
