My linux volume seems to \nbe much lower than my windows volume.  One more thing, is there a \ntaskbar in gnome like that of windows for finding minimized gaim \nwindows and such?  Lastly, if I install orca with speech-dispatcher \nsupport, is that gonna conflict with speakup?  Thanks much in advance.\n\nLater,\n\n\nGuy\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
