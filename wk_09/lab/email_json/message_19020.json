Have you read that module's README file?\n\n    http://search.cpan.org/src/UNCLE/Dialog-0.03/README\n\nIt doesn't look like a module that's finished. I'm not sure what\nyou're trying to do, but there may be a better module available on\nCPAN. Good luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
