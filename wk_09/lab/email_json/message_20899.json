But recently, the compositor of a journal is \ncomplaining that\n\n\"The eps files would be useable except that they have not converted the \ntype to outlines\"\n\nSorry for being vague, but I have no idea what this compositor is \ntalking about. Do people have similar experience? And is there an \noption in the dev.copy2eps() that I could use to fix this problem?\n\nMany thanks for any suggestion.\n\nBest,     Wing\n\n\n\n\ndept addr: Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, Manor Road, \nOxford OX1 3UQ, UK\ncollege addr: New College, Holywell Street, Oxford OX1 3BN, UK\ndept tel: +44 (1865) 286176; college tel:  +44 (1865) 279593\nhttp://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
