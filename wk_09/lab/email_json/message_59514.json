Let's look at the two possibilities:\n\nBefore:\n   GPL (either explicitly or implicitly): you can do X\n   Restriction: you can't do X\n\nResult - conflict and confusion; non-redistributable code\n\nAfter:\n   GPL (either explicitly or implicitly): you can do X\n   GPL: If I say you can't do X, you can ignore me\n   Restriction: you can't do X\n\nResult - the license is consistent, although it has one part which \nnullifies another part. This is similar to clauses of the form \"The \nprevious part of this clause does not apply if you are wearing blue \nunderwear\".\n\nIf you (in your example) license under GPLv3 + restriction, then by \npicking GPLv3 you are giving me, the recipient of the code, permission \nto remove the restriction. If you didn't want to give me that \npermission, you shouldn't have used GPLv3 - just as if you didn't want \nto give me permission to link my code with the Affero GPL (to take one \nexample of many), you shouldn't have used GPLv3.\n\nGerv\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
