You need to make sure you have all of\nthe dependencies perl needs (and not just the bare dependencies, but\nall of the ones used to compile it like RedHat does) and that you\nupdate everything that is tied to the old version of perl (e.g.\nmod_perl).  This is why package management systems are nice (I have\nbecome very lazy).\n\n>\n> >Long answer: If you have a valid backup, restore your system.  If you\n>\n> It didn't work.

At least it sounds like it is a personal or\ndevelopment machine rather than a production system.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
