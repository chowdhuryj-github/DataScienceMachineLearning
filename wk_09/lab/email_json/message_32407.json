Davison does not perform analysis of the potential feasibility, marketability, patentability or profitability of ideas submitted to it; nor does it provide patent services. New product development is an uncertain endeavor and Davison does not represent or guarantee, expressly or impliedly, that an idea submitted to it will be licensed, sell on any market or provide a positive return to the inventor on money spent for development. The products depicted above include both client-submitted products and products designed by Davison for its own benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
