If any guru from this circle could help me out, I would really appreciate.I have a system of equations in which some of the endogs appear on right hand sides of some equations. To solve this, one needs a technique like 2SLS or FIML to circumvent inconsistency of the estimated coefficients. My question is that if I apply the nonlinear regression like SVM regression. Do I still need to worry about endogeneity? Meaning, what I only need to care is the 1st step of 2SLS. That would mean that I only need to carry out the SVM regression on all the exogs. Am I missing anything here? Thank you so much.Regards,- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
