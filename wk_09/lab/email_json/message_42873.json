It has a '3' because I have to periodically change that address and I have unsubscribed before for the very same reason.  There's plenty of list management software which publishes archives without revealing the email addresses.  I can understand why this is frustrating for folks.\n\nOf course, then spammers could sign up for lists and harvests addresses from email sent, but it would be slower than going through archives.\n\nHmm, are there any mailing lists out there which offer one-time addresses for each person who sends?  If the address were to time out after a while and published archives didn't include addresses, this could make mailing list software more interesting.\n\nCheers,\nOvid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
