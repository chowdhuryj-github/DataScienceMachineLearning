To enable this,\nchanged the msg_type definitions to hexadecimal.\n\nThis way we could theoretically add the MSG_FLAG_NODUPLICATES again, but I\nwould rather not do this, because that one is racy and can't be guaranteed at\nall.\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/Makefile.in\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/include/messages.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/messages.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/printing/notify.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/include/messages.h\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/lib/messages.c\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0_26/source/printing/notify.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (769 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23112\n\n"}
