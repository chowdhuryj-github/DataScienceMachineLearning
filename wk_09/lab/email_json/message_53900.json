This looming clash comes clearer as Apple releases more [1]details\nof the iPhone's UI. Much has been made about the iPhone including Safari\nto provide a full web browsing experience. But this reader is wondering\nhow compatible certain sites will be with the iPhone's input. From the\npost: \"[Web 2.0-style interaction] makes somewhat heavy use of 'onmouse'\nevents and cursor changes... along with CSS a:hover styles. The iPhone\nchallenges those particular Web 2.0 conventions, though, because it is a\ndevice that not only adds support for another pointer, but at the same\ntime eliminates them as interface objects... [T]he user doesn't get to\nexpress their attention with the iPhone... They only get to express their\nimmediate action.\" This reader asks, \"What other pitfalls lurk in the\nmulti-touch web?

That's given the Congress' Joint Economic Committee\ntime to come to a decision about what exactly the value of virtual goods\nmeans for players and game-makers. An economist with the group told CNet\nto expect their report sometime next month. \"What that report will say is\nunknown, as the committee has kept entirely quiet about its thoughts.\nHowever, it's clear that something will happen. 'Given growth rates of 10\nto 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS\nstart paying attention to these issues,' [senior economist Dan] Miller,\nwho is a fan of virtual worlds and economies, told CNET News.com in\nDecember. 'So it is incumbent on us to set the terms and the debate so we\nhave a shaped tax policy toward virtual worlds and virtual economies in a\nfavorable way.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://politics.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/23/2055244\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9733848-7.html\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
