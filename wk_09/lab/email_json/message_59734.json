If you have a\nproblem with what it's trying to do, you won't like it (the goal is\nunchanged). If you have a problem with how it did it (the position that\nI, and most commenters on earlier drafts) were in, you will probably be\nmuch happier.\n\nIn any case, a new version of the AGPLv3 draft is due up soon. Please\nlook at the old one and comment on the new one when it's up.\n\nLater,\nMako\n\n-- \nBenjamin Mako Hill\nmako@debian.org\nhttp://mako.cc/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
