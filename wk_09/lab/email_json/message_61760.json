It \nis definately not GPL compatible.\nThe code does look distributable, but only in non-free, and I'm not certain \nof that either (did not look closely enough).\n\nThat is about all the anaysis he will be likely to get from this list, \nunless and until the program is proposed for packaging, and/or a Debian \nlegal contributer feels bored. \n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
