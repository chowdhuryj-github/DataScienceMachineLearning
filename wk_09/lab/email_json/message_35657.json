Having *THREE* trees to have to check in\nto, with some of them temporarily \"locked\" makes code management\ncompletely unreasonable.  This change was made weeks ago.\n\nI was awaiting release of 3.0.25a with these changes, and this is going\nto completely screw me up.  (You said you'd be cutting tomorrow and\nasked for testing today, which is what I did, and which is how I found\nthis.)\n\nDerrell\n\n"}
