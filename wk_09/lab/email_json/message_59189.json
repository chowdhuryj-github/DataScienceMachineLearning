Today I managed to build the \nastrolog 5.40 package for slackware and did it correctly enough that the \npackage shows up in my packages list when I install it and so far as I can \ntell the whole package works too. I just learned how to make a slackware \npackage that would do that.  Unfortunately linuxpackages.net uses capsha's \nso even though I built a package I can't register and submit it. Not good \nnews for anyone else in the speakup community wanting to submit a package. \nWhat I'm curious to know though is what the situation is with debian \nfedoraproject, gentoo, and ubuntu.  Do these sites also block totally \nblind package submitters from registering?  It was a surprise to me \ndroplinegnome didn't place such an impediment in my way but I'm not going \nto hold that against them.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
