Glad to know I can't just blame gentoo.\n\nAfter doing the binary search I mentioned earlier and finding that it\nstarted breaking in svn r19441, there was some discussion in the IRC\nchannel.  The important bit is:\n\n[13:35] <@chromatic> Hm, I don't blame 19441 for the shootout test.\n[13:35] <@chromatic> I think it just changed the memory characteristics of the program sufficiently to trigger a lurking GC bug.\n\n\nSo now I'll try to see if there was a DOD run that freed up something\nit shouldn't have, or something like that.\n\nThanks for testing!\n\nMark\n\n"}
