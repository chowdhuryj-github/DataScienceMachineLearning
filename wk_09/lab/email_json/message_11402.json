The actual location in which the\nlicense is distributed does not matter. All that matters is that it is\na license being used as a legal document under which a work in Debian\nis being distributed. It cannot be a license whose removal or\nabridgement would have no legal effect upon the work in which it is\ndistributed. [I would argue as well that its removal cannot have a\nfunctional effect on the work either.]\n\n\nDon Armstrong\n\n-- \nWhat I can't stand is the feeling that my brain is leaving me for \nsomeone more interesting.\n\nhttp://www.donarmstrong.com              http://rzlab.ucr.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
