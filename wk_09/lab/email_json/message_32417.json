Some of the biggest names in entertainment and news pay tribute \n      to him, but I'm most looking forward to watching clips of Cronkite \n      himself, especially \n      the enthusiasm he brought to space coverage.\u00a0 I can watch the \n      first moon landing, with Uncle Walter narrating, over and over again and \n      not get tired of it (and actually, my husband is a space junkie, so in my \n      house, it's required, regular viewing).\u00a0 \n      \n\nThis morning, we \n      also wrapped up our series \"Just Ask a Woman\" with a \n      look at some of the myths of motherhood (no, everyone else is NOT a better \n      mom than you are).\u00a0\u00a0The always funny Mike Myers stopped by to talk about the latest \n      Shrek movie.\u00a0 And\u00a0CBS News Sunday Morning's Bill \n      Geist was in the studio, telling Harry all about his new book: \"Way Off the \n      Road,\" which chronicles his travels, trademark wit in tow, \n      \u00a0to some of the wackier spots in this country.\u00a0I have so many \n      favorite Geist stories, it's tough to pick one (maybe the cowpie tossing \n      contest?), and I'm excited to revisit them all in this \n      book.\n\nTomorrow on The Saturday Early \n      Show, I'll be joined by our terrific new\u00a0national\u00a0correspondent, \n      Jeff Glor.\u00a0\u00a0We'll help you decide when to give your \n      kids\u00a0an allowance -- and how \n      much -- plus, we'll offer some tips on the best ways to make up after a \n      fight with your significant other (G-rated, of course). We'll have a PJ \n      fashion show (also G-rated);\u00a0since it's Jeff's first Saturday show, \n      I'm going to have a little fun with him and tell him he's supposed \n      to\u00a0dress up in\u00a0PJ's for the segment. Tune in tomorrow to see if \n      he falls for it ...\nAnd next week on \"The Early Show,\" \n      we'll be featuring a new series, \"Happily Ever After.\" We asked you to \n      share your own love\u00a0stories \n      with us and out of hundreds of responses we've chosen five couples \n      to highlight on the show.\u00a0 Our couples have all faced their own \n      unique challenges: dealing with illnesses, accidents, a special needs \n      child ...\u00a0even one couple that almost didn't get married.\u00a0Their \n      stories are\u00a0touching and \n      provide guidance on how we can all have our own \u201cHappily Ever \n      After.\u201d\n\nTracy\u00a0 SmithEarlyShow@cbs.com \n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
