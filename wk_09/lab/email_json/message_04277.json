I intentionaly use informal terms, rather than \ntechnical terms whose exact meaning I might or might not know.\n\nI am finding this extremely frustrating. Every time I try to do anything, \nall I get is error messages. Hey, this isn't rocket science; there are only \nthree or four or five steps involved. Well, what are they? There is all this \nopaque terminology. There are libraries, and packages, and one downloads \nthem, loads them, and installs them, but just what all this means is \nunclear.\n\nOne example among many: I tell it\n\nlibrary (gam)  all I get is an error message.\n\nError in library (gam)  : there is no package called 'gam'\n\nWell, does this mean what it says, or does it mean something different? For \nexample, does it mean that such-and-such computer program has not yet been \ndownloaded?\n\nI did download and install the 2.4.1 flavor (version?) of the gui. I infer, \nreading between the lines a bit, that there may be a sort of standard \nprocedure for setting things up, perhaps downloading and installing the \nutils package, or something.\n\nThe R software has much gold in it, but, as far as learnability/usability is \nconcerned, I give it poor marks.\n\nTom Jones\nDrJones at alum.MIT.edu\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
