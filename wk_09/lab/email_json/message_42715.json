In fact, I'm doing this right now (well, in my  \nexperimental code) to tell the etoys factory which service to create.  \nBut the activity ID is not static and cannot be specified in the  \nactivity bundle. It comes via dbus in the create() call to the  \nactivity factory. Since activity factories are launched via dbus you  \ncan't use env vars either. That's what I alluded to when I suggested  \nearlier that it would be easier to only have to provide the bundle id  \nas X property. OTOH, if you say it's simple, then sure, add those env  \nvars, and I see what I can make of it :)\n\n> Another solution would be to change sugar/matchbox to not even raise\n> toplevel windows until they advertise the correct activity ID and  \n> bundle\n> ID.
