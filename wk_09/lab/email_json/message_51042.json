If\nyou're doing LFS then \"you're on your own\" it is not \nreasonable to expect people to make software \"LFS compatible\". But then if\nyou're into LFS then surely you can make whatever \nminor tweaks necessary to adapt, and that will be half the fun. Slack and\nLFS are two of my fave distros. Less is more :)\n\nGena wrote:\nThe lfs team have a script to unpack debs and rpms.  So that they can \nbe installed on a lfs / blfs system.  Can't remember what it is called.  \nI guess slackware users would need it too, in that case.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.9.1/854 - Release Date: 6/19/2007\n1:12 PM\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
