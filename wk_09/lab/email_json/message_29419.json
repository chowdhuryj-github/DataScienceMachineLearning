Although structural balance is not implemented,\nfor three or four nodes it might be straightforward to do a quick \nimplemntation which works for small graphs. \n\nBtw. what is exactly you want to do? List the number of balanced and\nunbalanced triangles? Ot the triangles themselves? What is a semi-cycle?\nCould you point me to a good online reference about structureal balance?\n\nThanks,\nGabor\n\nOn Sat, May 12, 2007 at 11:44:21PM +0200, Tom Backer Johnsen wrote:\n> R-Netters:\n> \n> for (partial sentimental reasons) I am at the the moment working on \n> some old data of mine (actually collected 40 years ago this year for \n> my thesis) covering development of of social networks in small groups \n> over time.
