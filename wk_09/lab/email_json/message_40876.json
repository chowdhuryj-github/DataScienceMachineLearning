For some prime-time shows, it means\nthat DVR viewing, long seen as a threat to advertising, could even bring\nhigher ad prices. NBC's The Office, for example, had a live-plus-three\nNielsen commercial rating of 3.36 \\u2014 higher than the 3.11 it got for the\nweek of May 6 under the traditional Nielsen program rating system.' Makes\nme wonder where this will lead for my favorite genre shows which by their\nvery nature have a [1]higher DVR component and have seen declining\nviewership using the older methodology (BSG, SG-1, etc).\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/01/1626245\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2007-06-01-nielsens-usat_N.htm\n    1. http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lord of the Rings Online Review                                    |\n|   from the you-got-your-hobbit-in-my-mmog dept.                    |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday June 01, @13:44 (Role Playing (Games))  |\n|   http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/01/0816244        |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe circle is now complete. With Turbine's release of Lord of the Rings\nOnline: The Shadows of Angmar (LOTRO), the Massively Mutliplayer game\nfiguratively eats the tail of its originator in ouroboros-like fashion.\nTolkien's work begat Dungeons and Dragons, the PC gaming market, CRPGs,\nand finally Massive games, and last month's release of LOTRO beautifully\nreconnects the future with the past. Replacing dice-wielding friends\naround a table has even, wonder of wonders, been done well. Polished\ngameplay and cutting-edge graphics abound; In direct contrast to the\nlackluster response to Turbine's other MMOG, Dungeons and Dragons Online,\nLord of the Rings Online has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from\nfans. Read on for my notes from the experience of trying on Hobbit feet\nfor a month, and a few words about why LOTRO's quality is notable and\nhighly encouraging.\n\nThis story continues at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/01/0816244\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/06/01/0816244\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 'Eolas' Browser Plug-in Patent Case Rises Again                    |\n|   from the return-of-the-living-patent-case dept.                  |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday June 01, @14:21 (Patents)               |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/01/1630206          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]eldavojohn writes \"A legal battle that has been around since 1999 and\n[1]seemingly ended in 2005 now [2]rears its head again.
