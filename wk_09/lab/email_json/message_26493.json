The attributes of the various DER facilities currently available can address many of a utility\u2019s needs, such as:\n\u00a0\n\nSatisfying the renewable requirements being legislated through the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)\nRelieving congestion on transmission lines\n\nDeferring capital investment in generation assets\n\n\n\u00a0\nBut, even the most DER \u201cfriendly\u201d utilities are rightfully concerned about loss of revenue, contractual arrangements and risk management.\n\u00a0\nUtilities are facing new situations like:\n\u00a0\n\nA DER facility may be positioned perfectly to provide VAR support, but the utility\u2019s tariff arrangements do not provide for its customers to supply VARs\n\nA new CHP is proposed at a manufacturing facility that is located on a \u201csoft\u201d portion of a utility\u2019s grid. How can the utility make arrangements for the potential support that may be provided by the new generation?\n\nA large pulp and paper facility wants to provide surplus power that may violate wheeling regulations. How can the surplus be accommodated?\n\nThe new frozen food packaging facility is looking at a site analysis that suggests a CHP facility will be the deciding factor on where to locate\u2014inside your territory or on the grid of the competing utility in the next county\u2014what rate structure\n                        will be profitable for both parties and keep the facility in your revenue stream?\n\nA children\u2019s hospital needs to ensure power is available when disaster strikes, and has a need for increased thermal energy. What arrangements can be made to use a CHP facility as a standby energy resource?\n\n\n\u00a0\nNew market opportunities are fueled by state interconnection standards, renewable portfolio standards, and municipalities that are moving toward sustainability programs. At the same time, new technologies are making small generating units more efficient and renewable qualified. Utilities are faced with a matrix of opportunities for distributed energy resources that will be shaped by regional situations. New ownership, operation and maintenance models may also provide the mechanism that makes a DER profitable for all involved. These market changes require a new business model that incorporates legislated requirements, greening efforts, and new technologies.\n\u00a0\nThis conference is designed to summarize the factors that are reshaping the DER market and highlight business models that may create a favorable agreement for utilities.\n\u00a0\nEUCI, a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric industry, has assembled experts to explore new business models that utilities are using to profitably integrate distributed generation into their portfolio mix.\n\u00a0\nWho Will Benefit From this Conference? \nThis conference will provide new and valuable information for all levels of utility staff and management.
