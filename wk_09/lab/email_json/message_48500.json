My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.\n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am \nvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I \nhave distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia.\n\nNow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refusedand kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $18,000,000 that I have with a finance/Security Company in europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit \nand dispatche it to charity organizations.I have set aside 30% for you and for your time. \n\nGod be with you.\nJAIN HAGIS\n\n\n\n"}
