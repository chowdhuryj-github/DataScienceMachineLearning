We need this information to develop a proposal explaining the\nopportunity of Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industries to export under patent\nmedicine to other LDCs or developing countries.\n\nWe will be highly obliged, if anyone please answer the queries with some\nexplanation, analysis and suggested references.\n\n1. Can Bangladesh as an LDC, produce and export medicines (to LDCs or Developing\ncountries or all countries) until 2016 that are still under patent without any\nroyalties or any agreement with the patent holder?\n\n2. Does the importing country, if an LDC; needs to issue any license (voluntary\nor compulsory) or negotiation with the patent holder?\n\n3. Does the importing country, if NOT an LDC; needs to issue any license\n(voluntary or compulsory) or negotiation with the patent holder?\n\n4. Can Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industries utilize (import) raw materials of\nunder patent medicines procured from any developing countries (like India or\nChina) for export purpose?\n\nLooking forward to hear from you.\nWith sincere regards,\n\nDr. Md .Sayedur Rahman\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Pharmacology\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University\nShahbag\nDhaka 1000\nBangladesh\nTel: 00880-1199840757\nEmail: srkhasru@bdcom.com\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nBDCOM Online Limited. http://www.bdcom.com\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
