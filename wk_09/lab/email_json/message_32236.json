In this example its not apparent since\nthat never occurs.  At any rate, it should be:\n\nf <- function(x) 4 - pmin(3, match(x, sort(unique(x), decreasing = TRUE)))\nfactor(ave(dfr$var3, dfr$categ, FUN = f), lab = c(\"low\", \"mid\", \"high\"))\n\nAlso note that the factor labels were arranged so that\n\"low\", \"mid\" and \"high\" correspond to levels 1, 2 and 3\nrespectively.\n\nOn 5/18/07, Gabor Grothendieck  wrote:\n> Try this.  f assigns 1, 2 and 3 to the highest, second highest and third highest\n> within a category.  ave applies f to each category.
