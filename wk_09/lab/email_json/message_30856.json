The\nline it will be looking for is\nCUSTOMER ENVIRONMENT customer_name\nwhere customer_name will never have a space making it one word.  If I just want\nto pull from the line the customer_name would my regex look like\n$MatchString = \"CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENT\\s+(\\w)\"\n\nFor what it's worth the line that will handle this is\n$found = ($Transaction->Attachments->First->Content =~ /$MatchString/m);\nI'm guessing that when used in an assignment like this, $1 will be used as the\nvalue.  The contents of (\\w) in this case.  Is that correct?\n\nMathew\n-- \nKeep up with me and what I'm up to: http://theillien.blogspot.com\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
