I'm still developing the Unix  \nemulation layer, Lamp (Lamp Ain't Mac POSIX) on which it will run,  \nincluding the kernel and prerequisite userland utilities -- one of  \nwhich is perl.\n\nJust this weekend I ported Lamp to 68K, and after a little assembly  \nhacking and refactoring yylex() into small enough chunks, perl made  \nthe trip as well.\n\nOnce I get perl further along (as right now it's only miniperl -- I  \nhaven't written dlopen() yet) and add some missing features to the  \nshell, I'll take on building parrot.  Chances are, if it works on  \nCygWin, I can make it run in traditional Mac OS -- on both  \narchitectures.\n\nJosh\n\n\n"}
