In an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 2000 \nin a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all  his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at \nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n       It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release \nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety \nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want \nthis money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\n       The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money \nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the \nBank treasury as unclaime fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that \n30 % of this money will be for you  as foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account,10 %will be set aside for expenses incured \nduring the business and 60 %would be for ;me and my colleagues.\nThere afterI and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted \n.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you\nby fax or email the text of the application.
