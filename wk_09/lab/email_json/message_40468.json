Having started in the telecommunications industry, revenue assurance management has become the mantra of achieving operating efficiency. Now, Wall Street, private equity, and deregulation are forcing energy companies to more aggressively tackle their cost and loss issues.\n\u00a0\nRevenue leakage can be a significant problem for an energy company. A revenue assurance solution involves a series of activities to ensure that the business processes, controls, organizational structure and information systems related to the revenue cycle work together effectively to maximize revenues and operating margins.\n\u00a0\nTogether, we will explore what revenue assurance programs should be initiated, when the project should be undertaken, who in the organization will sponsor them, and what technologies would be leveraged to maximize these solutions.\n\u00a0\nWhat Attendees Will Learn:\n\u00a0\n\nRevenue Assurance Basics\n\nCommon Symptoms and Causes for Revenue Leakage\n\nIdentifying Common Exposure Points\n\nDesigning Effective Revenue Controls\n\nDesigning a Revenue Assurance Organization\n\nBilling Fraud Detection and Prevention\n\nDeveloping a Revenue Assurance Dashboard and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nRevenue Assurance Technology and Tools\n\n\nWho Should Attend:\n\u00a0\nThe seminar is designed for executive and management level personnel whose responsibilities may include customer service, billing, collections, internal audit, and loss prevention. In addition, information technology personnel who have overseen Customer Information System (CIS) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) projects are also strongly encouraged to attend.\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\nCapacity \n\t\t\tMarkets\n Washington, DC\n June  4-6, 2007\n  Coal-to-Liquids \n                            Finance and Development Summit\n New York, NY\n June  4-6, 2007\n   Strategies for \n                            Bidding Ancillary Services in LMP Markets\n Indianapolis, \n                IN\n June 6-7, 2007\n  Intro to Electric \n                            Utility Systems for Non Engineers\n Austin, \n                TX\n June 14-15, 2007\n   Distributed \n                            Energy Resources-Emerging Business Models for Utilities\n Austin, \n                TX\n June 14-15, 2007\n  Managing Physical \n                            & Financial Uncertainty in the Power Industry\n New York, \n                 NY\n June 19-20, 2007\n  Value \n                            and Risk in Energy Markets - Introduction & Principles (Program 8)\n San Diego, CA\n June 19-21, 2007\n  Alternative \n                            Regulation for Electric and Gas Utilities\n Boston, MA\n June 25-26, 2007\n  In Depth \n                            Introduction to Electricity Markets\n  Alexandria, VA\n June 25-26, 2007\n  Customer \n                            Communications for Utilities\n Boston, \n                            MA\n June 27-28, 2007\n  Implementation \n                            and Cost-Benefit of Workplace Weight Management Strategies\n  Chicago, IL\n June 28-29, 2007\n  EEI's 2007 \n                            Transmission and Wholesale Market School\n  Madison, WI\n July 9-13, 2007\n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
