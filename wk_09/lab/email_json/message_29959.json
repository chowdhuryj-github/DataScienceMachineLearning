The\nstreaming video offering allowed viewers to watch sports and reruns\ndirectly on the web, but required potential consumers to view the video\non CBS.com. That didn't work, even a little bit. So, they've learned\ntheir lesson: 'The company plans to pursue a drastically revised strategy\nthat involves syndicating its entertainment, news and sports video to as\nmuch of the Web as possible. It represents a stark departure for the TV\nindustry. Most of CBS's major competitors, including Walt Disney Co.'s\nABC, General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal and News Corp.'s Fox, are to\nsome degree all betting that they can build their own Internet video\nportals. Starting this week, an expanded menu of CBS's video content will\nbe available for free to consumers on as many as 10 different Web sites\nranging from Time Warner Inc.'s AOL to Joost Inc., a buzzy online video\nservice that is just rolling out.

The\nNorwegian recommendation was revealed by Minister of Renewal Heidi Grande\nRoys, on behalf of the Cabinet-appointed Norwegian Standards Council. If\nadopted, it would require all government agencies and services to use\nthese two formats, and would permit other formats (such as OOXML) to be\nused only in a redundant capacity.Reflecting a pragmatic approach to the\ncontinuing consideration of OOXML by ISO/IEC JTC 1, the recommendation\ncalls for Norway to 'promote the convergence of the ODF and OOXML, in\norder to avoid having two standards covering the same usage.' According\nto the press release, the recommendation will be the subject of open\nhearings, with opinions to be rendered to the Cabinet before August 20\nthis summer.The Cabinet would then make its own (and in this case\nbinding) recommendation to the Norwegian government.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://politics.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/14/1616248\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php\n    1. http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070513180219689\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Jonathan Coulton, a Day in the Life                                |\n|   from the code-monkey-still-the-best dept.                        |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 14, @13:47 (The Internet)  |\n|   http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/14/170216               |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe New York Times is running a look [0]behind the scenes with\nsinger/songwriter Jonathan Coulton, creator the somewhat popular \"Thing a\nweek\" songs on his blog. Coulton describes a bit of how he got started\nand what daily life is like maintaining relations with his fans. \"Along\nthe way, he discovered a fact that many small-scale recording artists are\ncoming to terms with these days: his fans do not want merely to buy his\nmusic. They want to be his friend. And that means they want to interact\nwith him all day long online. They pore over his blog entries, commenting\nwith sympathy and support every time he recounts the difficulty of\nwriting a song. They send e-mail messages, dozens a day, ranging from\nsimple mash notes of the \"you rock!\" variety to starkly emotional\nletters, including one by a man who described singing one of Coulton's\nlove songs to his 6-month-old infant during her heart surgery. Coulton\nresponds to every letter, though as the e-mail volume has grown to as\nmany as 100 messages a day, his replies have grown more and more terse,\nto the point where he's now feeling guilty about being rude.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/14/170216\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/magazine/13audience-t.html?ex=1336708800&en=1d5b4728dc04dc8d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| A \"Bill of Lights\" to Restrict LEDs on Gadgets?                    |\n|   from the palm-flower dept.                                       |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday May 14, @14:31 (Portables)     |\n|   http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/14/1748229     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]PetManimal writes \"Mike Elgan has [1]had it with useless lights on\ngadgets and computers.
