You could have done:\n\nmy_SGDF <- readRAST6(c(\"landuse_mapname_in_grass\", \n  \"catchement_mapname_in_grass\",\n  \"precipitation_mapname_in_grass\"), cat=c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))\n\ntreating the whole as a single SpatialGridDataFrame, and the first two \nmaps as factors (categorical).\n\nPlease remember that class(), summary(), image(), and other methods let \nyou look at the data you have read - here I would certainly do:\n\nsummary(my_SGDF)\nimage(my_SGDF, \"precipitation_mapname_in_grass\")\n\nYou can then try:\n\nmy_DF <- as(my_SGDF, \"data.frame\")\naggregate(my_DF, by=list(my_DF$catchement_mapname_in_grass, \n  my_DF$landuse_mapname_in_grass), sum, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nalthough I'm not sure whether this is what you need.\n\nThere are two mailing lists that are better suited to this question, \nR-sig-geo on the R side, and STATGRASS on the GRASS side, both with a fair \nnumber of experienced helpers.\n\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> Jessica\n> \n> \n> ########################################################################3\n> \n> Dear all,\n> \n> \n> I am exporting grass map into R thanks to the very useful spgrass6 package.\n> \n> library(spgrass6)\n> \n> # I have 3 map I am working with a MASK map of a specific area.\n> \n> # 1) a landuse map\n> landuse<-readRAST6(\"landuse_mapname_in_grass\")\n> \n> # 2) a catchment map which divide the area in several catchements\n> catchment<-readRAST6(\"catchement_mapname_in_grass\")\n> \n> # 3) a precipitation map\n> precipitation<-readRAST6(\"precipitation_mapname_in_grass\")\n> \n> \n> # then I would like to sum the precipitation spatialy over each catchment\n> and landuse.
