Javascript is not \nthe same, and I wish it would just not exist. It is used for\nall the wrong reasons. The only reason it does exist is \nbecause Sun allowed Netscape to create a scripting \nlanguage based on Java, but is not Java, in order to help\nproliferate Java on the web. It was bad decision for Sun.\n\nJava is very useful as a technology, for networking code \non embedded devices, and for server code. I have \nwritten powerful server based apps that when you view \nthe pages they are text, but the text is generated by Java,\nthis is very powerful, but completely different than the \nJavascript fiasco. There is no need for Javascipt, Java,\nDHTML, or any other \"dynamic\" content languages on \nweb pages. There are too many risks involved and too\nmany restrictions on how the information can be used.\nI'd like to see new standards evolve out of W3C.\n \n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
