I've tried pdftotext from the xpdf bundle, and it worked \nfine for the file you linked. In my Ubuntu Linux it is in the\nxpdf-utils package, search to xpdf to find out whether it is available \non windows if you use windows. \n\nIf you want to call it from R you can use the 'system' function. \n\nThere may be other, better method i'm unaware of, of course.\n\nBest,\nGabor\n\nOn Wed, May 09, 2007 at 03:47:59PM +0100, Vittorio wrote:\n> Each day the daily balance in the following link\n> \n> http://www.\n> snamretegas.it/italiano/business/gas/bilancio/pdf/bilancio.pdf\n> \n> is \n> updated.\n> \n> I would like to set up an R procedure to be run daily in a \n> server able to read the figures in a couple of lines only \n> (\"Industriale\" and \"Termoelettrico\", towards the end of the balance) \n> and put the data in a table.\n> \n> Is that possible?
