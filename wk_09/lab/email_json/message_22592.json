We don't. \nInvestigations show that the only ones to be protected from buying fake pills are those who shop at licensed Web pharmacies dealing straight with the manufacturer with no third parties involved (such as CanadianPharmacy). Try CanadianPharmacy our prices for real generic medications are the best.\nCanadianPharmacy your #1 source for cheap generic drugs from Canada.\nYours faithfully,Jake Flanagan\n\n\n\n\n"}
