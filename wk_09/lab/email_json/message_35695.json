A side by side \ncomparison\nof several compiler tool that target the same language, PHP, to the same \nvirtual machine, Parrot.\nCurrently the compiler tools that I'm toying with are:\n\n- XML output of phc, transformed by XSLT\n- ANTLR3\n- PGE and TGE\n\nOn my TODO list are:\n\n- lex and yacc\n- Perl 5.10 regexes\n\nThe downside is that all these implementations are still very rudimentary.\nBut that's entirely due to my lack of abiltity and time.\n\nRegards,\n  Bernhard\n\n"}
