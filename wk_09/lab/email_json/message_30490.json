(It may restrict their \noptions, but it does not leave them with no options at all.) You don't need \nto overstate the case.\n\n> It is time for the \n> funding model to evolve.  \n\nExperiments welcome here.\n\n> Historically, bundled into the \n> cost of each CD or book is the cost of production and\n> distribution.

It works like a social network for\n> artist and fans with specialized features to promote,\n> fund, and distribute new media.  A library of CC licensed\n> media leads to you to discover new artists.
