And it realy should return\nLDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT in this case, but we have too many code not\nchecking for LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT, so that we would break a lot\nif we would let ldb_tdb return LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT.\n\nmetze\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.5 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with SUSE - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGjJedm70gjA5TCD8RAvtzAKCCgnVcVwcFP3V1pz+wjU2bINpinQCfbEsR\n3KRfSGvVt6vZLGomR1TCy3E=\n=F/Na\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
