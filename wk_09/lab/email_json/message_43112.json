However, the IN operator should be fast, even for large vectors.   \nIt takes me a second to retrieve 10,000 random records from a table with\n100,000+ rows.\n\nsystem.time(id.in( sample(1:100000, 10000) ))[3]\n[1] 1.07\n\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention this before -  if your ID is a character field, you\ncan quote strings in the IN clause using the shell quote function.\n\npaste(shQuote(ids),collapse=\",\")\n\nChris\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
