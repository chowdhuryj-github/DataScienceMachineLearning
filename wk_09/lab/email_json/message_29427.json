Here it is again\n\nError in X11(display, width, height, pointsize, if (is.null(gamma)) 1 else \ngamma,  :\n        invalid 'width' or 'height'\n\nI get it on two computers, one on AMD64 and one on x86, both running Gentoo \nunstable.  If I do ?x11 and type in the default usage thingy, it works \nperfectly well.  I.E.:\n\n     X11(display = \"\", width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12,\n         gamma = getOption(\"gamma\"), colortype = getOption(\"X11colortype\"),\n         maxcubesize = 256, bg = \"transparent\", canvas = \"white\",\n         fonts = getOption(\"X11fonts\"), xpos = NA, ypos = NA)\n \nworks.  Similarly, calling x11 with width and height of 7 works fine.  The \nlocale of my computer is UTF8 but that hasn't changed since the upgrade and \nit was working well before. Does anyone know what might be going on?  Any \nhelp is appreciated, thanks!  I've tried searching both the Gentoo and R \nhelp.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
