All are welcome, especially anyone interested in Creative Commons, copyright, Free Culture, Open Source, Art, Media, and Music.\nIf you'd like to take part, whether by performing or exhibiting your work, giving a talk or presentation, providing sponsorship or other support, or by getting involved in the running of the event, we'd love to hear from you, Please drop me a line if this sounds like you! We'd be especially keen to hear from artists, musicians and anyone else who publishes creative work under an open license, or anyone whose cultural practice involves appropriation, quotation, remixing, sampling and collage. Do get in touch if you'd like the opportunity to show off your work!\nPlease do pass this message on to anyone else who may be interested.Many thanks,Tim\n\n\n\nhttp://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon\n\nhttp://www.openrightsgroup.org\nhttp://www.freeculture.org.ukhttp://ccsalon-london.org.uk\n\n"}
