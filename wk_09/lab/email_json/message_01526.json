I use RODBC on Linux to read data from a mainframe DB2 database.  I\nhad to create the file .odbc.ini in my home directory with lines like this:\n\n[m1db2p]\nDriver             = DB2\nServername         = NameOfOurMainframe\nDatabase           = fdrp\nUserName           = \"NachoBizness\"\nTraceFile          = /home/NachoBizness/.odbc.log\n\nand then to connect I do this:\n\nSys.putenv(DB2INSTANCE = \"db2inst\")\nmyConnection <- odbcConnect(dsn = \"m1db2p\", uid = uid, pwd = pwd, case = \"toupper\")\n\nwith 'uid' and 'pwd' set to my mainframe uid and password.\n\nNow, I am not the sysadmin for our Linux machines, but I don't think they had\nto do much beyond the standard rpm installation to get this working.  \n\n-- \nJeff\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
