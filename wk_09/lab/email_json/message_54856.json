I tried using Jelmer's bzr-svn plugin but never\ngot things going just right.  But git-svn just worked\nout for the box. The reason why this is important to me\nis that it allows for experimenting with git without\nchanging any samba.org infrastructure.  The git-svnimport\nwent smooth as well so these two are known quantities to me.\n\nI assume that mercurial has something similar but a\nquick search doesn't turn anything up.  Have you got\nany pointers for me?\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGf+KoIR7qMdg1EfYRAvweAKDDm7srLWXmdkGBPz2dx35bKxcgMACggMm5\nDXSg1ONVSbGe0QKNAeA66Tc=\n=axVy\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
