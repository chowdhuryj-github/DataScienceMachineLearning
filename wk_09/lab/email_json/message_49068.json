Of \ncourse, in the current version of .garchOxFit, the line number has \nchanged, but the line should still be there, and if .garchOxFit has less \nthan 55 lines, it should be easy to find.\nDoes your example still work, if you don't have a variable 'x' visible \nto garchOxFit (in your environment/search path)? I suppose garchOxFit \njust uses the series stored in 'x' (in your current workspace) instead \nof 'IanSeries' (which is even worse than aborting...).\n\nRegards,\n\n  Martin\n\n\nIan Gregory schrieb:\n> I tried the following and it works for me (after the changes to make):\n>\n> library(fSeries)\n> data(dem2gbp)\n> IanSeries = dem2gbp[, 1]\n> garchOxFit(~garch(1,1),IanSeries)\n>\n> Any writing of data is performed in the GarchOxModelling.ox file.\n> The number of lines of code in the function .garchOxFit() does not appear\n> to go up to 55.
