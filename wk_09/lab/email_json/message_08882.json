So i think that debian should have\nthe goal to give those users a better solution than the general one.\n> \n> My goal with this project is to create a CDD that provides it's users with the\n> tools they need to easily install and use the things a small and mid-sized\n> business needs in their working environment.

We have desktop\ntask, so we could add an enterprise-desktop task.\n\nMy point was to provide centralized authentication and information,\nhaving something like libpam-ldap and libpam-mount installed and\nconfigured by debconf's interface.\n\nFor -ldap is easy, just now, it just asks for the server, but -mount\nwould mount server partitions as well as user's desktop preferences.\n\nAlso, it would be given care to the tools and packages included.\n\nA cdd would be good for some first testing, but having it included in\ndebian would be great.\n> \n> I would very much like to hear the opinions of the developer community.\n> The first -and very important- step to be taken is to form a group of people that\n> support this goal and are willing to work on it.\n\ncount with me.\n> \n> If there are no major objections I will start to get things going.\n> \n> Regards,\n> \n>  \n> \n> Arjan van Eersel\n> ---- Dit bericht is verzonden via mijndomein.nl\n\nbest regards\n\nLuis Matos\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
