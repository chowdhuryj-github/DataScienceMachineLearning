OK, I already uninstalled all free versions\u00a0\nThere are good instructions herehttp://plugindoc.mozdev.org/linux-amd64.html.I had a look at it. Looked pretty good but still uses nspluginwrapper which gives me this error now:\n# nspluginwrapper -i libflashplayer.so/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: cannot execute binary file/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: cannot execute binary file\nnspluginwrapper: libflashplayer.so is not a valid NPAPI pluginI used the provided packages though. Don't understand. If you got an explanation or a solution ;), I'll take it.Regards,Alexandre\n--stan ioan-eugen <stan.ieugen@gmail.com\n>\n"}
