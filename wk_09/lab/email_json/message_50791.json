There was also another report today into the affair - examining how the incident occured in the first place. Browne admitted that collective failures led to the sailors seizure. Mark Urban will be analysing the content of the two reports.\n\n\nPRISONS\n\n\nWith the prison population topping 81,000, the Justice Secretary Lord Falconer says he will release over a thousand prisoners early to ease the overcrowding crisis.
