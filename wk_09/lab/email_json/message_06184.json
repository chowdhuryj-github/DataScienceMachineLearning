I am contacting you concerning our customer\nand, an investment placed under our banks management 4 years ago.\n\nI would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail\nconfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a\nresult of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation\nand no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you\nwith certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\n\nIn 2002, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012   came to our bank to\nengage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over\n(invest) on his behalf.\n\nI was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in\nline with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the\nPrivate Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds\nhe wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any\ninvestments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth\nfunds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is\nto start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers\nand 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun\nthe money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this\npoint at over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the\nfull potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on\ninvestments. In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he\nneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I\ninformed him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have\nto make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and\nstatutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around\nwhen I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in  and had the funds\navailable. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his\nprecise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a\nsecurity consultancy firm, the firm  is a specialist private firm that\naccepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip\ncorporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that\nneed immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization\nis familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected\norganizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited . He \ntold me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from\nNorway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this\ntranspired around 9th October, 2004.\n\nIn January last year, we got a call from the security firm  informing us\nthat the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding\nposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit , and\nI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit. I\nmade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of\nlocating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of\nchina. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he\nwas dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\nattack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an\ninvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the\nsituation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are\nfamiliar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services\nusually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from\nconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In\nthe field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will\nknow of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors\nuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives\nthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I\nsaid, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart\nfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in\nour care, in this case; he died intestate.\n\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\nshould have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past\nmonths been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. The investigation did not ever yield any result My official\ncapacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation\nand the only party to receive the results of the investigation.  This\nleaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing\nsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the\ndeposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial\nyear broadcast a request for statements of claim to BOC, failing to\nreceive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to\nBOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC accounting system and\nthe portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking\nServices Department. This will not happen if I have my way.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nwho occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have\nbegun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited , I alone have the deposit details and\nthey will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I\nalone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as BOC is\nconcerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I\nsent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to\nthe file are just customer services and due process.  They are simply\nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes\nforward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money\ntrying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and\nhave found no family. The investigation has come to an end.\n\nMy proposal;  I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction\nfor the release of the  deposit to you as the closest surviving relation.\nUpon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in\nhalf. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them\nrelease the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.\n\nI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within\na few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file\nrelating to the customer  I will then officially communicate with  firm \nand instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things:\nall is done. The alternative would be for us to have firm direct the funds\nto another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need\nfor you to think of receiving the money from the firm.  We can fine-tune\nthis based on our interactions.\n\nI am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no\ninterest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you\ndo not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my\ncareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this\nbut people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable\nsituations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and\nwhat I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you\nto understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot\nlet this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my\ndestiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my\nchance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with\nmy life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an\nopportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for\nthis project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the\nrisks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me\nand alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good\nfortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center\nof relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same\nemail account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this\nprocess towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact\nme via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project.\nI repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines\nnor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact\nme only through  through this email address. I do not want any direct link\nbetween you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are\nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with\nour Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction\nreligiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and\nchildren. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what\nthe consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing\ngained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of\ngold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking\nclients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, send me\nyour response on this email immediately to enable us commence this line of\ndiscussion.\n\n\nI await your response.\n\nMichael Leyden.\n\n\n\n"}
