Everything seems to be working well except datetimes between\nMarch 12, 2006 02:00 and 02:59 get moved one hour forward.  This does not\nseem to be happening with Excel connecting to the same connection.  March 12\nseems a bit early for Daylight savings time.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nR 2.5.0  Windows XP with the latest RODBC (I'm not sure how to get the\nversions of the packages in use)\n\nThank you very much,\n   deinst\n\n(R is a fantastic package.)\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
