And \n      when you take that moment later and you try and reflect on it, it hits \n      you. It really does hit you. And I know that after Columbine, I know that \n      after 9/11, that there is this time that you start to process what you've \n      seen, you start to think about the people you've talked to. Even now, \n      being back in New York, there's a couple of students that we talked to \n      that you want to reach out to, just to see how they're doing.

He portrays us as easily-manipulated stooges on \n      bended-knee to the President and his top aides. Now, I\u2019m the first \n      to concede there are plenty of good reasons to criticize the White House \n      Press. We\u2019re an irascible and unlikable bunch. I\u2019m one of us and I don\u2019t \n      like us very much. But the point made by Bill Moyers at the start of his \n      program last night is just off base.\"[+ Read More]\n\n\n\nRules \n      Of EngagementThis morning, an email landed in my inbox with \n      the usage guidelines for tonight's MSNBC-sponsored debate between the \n      Democratic presidential candidates. These are the rules that non-NBC media \n      outlets need to follow if they want to use any of video of the event. The \n      rules are fairly standard of the restrictions that media outlets often \n      apply when it comes to content like this, and they are nothing if not \n      thorough.\u00a0Jeff\u00a0Jarvis\u00a0argues\u00a0that NBC\u00a0is\u00a0claiming\u00a0\"the \n      right to own the democratic discussion in this country.\" Check the rules out here.[+ Read More]\n\n\n\n E-mail us your questions, tips, \n      concerns Public Eye RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEditor's \n      Picks\nThe \n      Public Eye Chat With\u2026Andrew Cohen\n\u00a0\nThe \n      Public Eye Chat With\u2026Jennifer Siebens\n\u00a0\nThe Public Eye \n      Chat With\u2026Allen Pizzey\n\n\n\nTo \n      unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.Contact: \n      Email Administrator, CBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St., Room 514/1, New York, \n      NY, 10019Help | Advertise | Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\u00a9MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. \n      All Rights Reserved. \n\n"}
