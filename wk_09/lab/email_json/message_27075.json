When only equality constraints are\ninvolved, a popular way to do this is to augment the objective function with\na Lagrangian term and with a quadratic penalty term.  When general\ninequalities are present, it is a lot harder, but various kinds of \"barrier\nfunctions\" are used.  \n\nA canonical reference (quite theoretical) for constrained optimization is\nthe book:\nFiacco and McCormick (1968, but reprinted as classic by SIAM in 1990):\nNonlinear programming: sequential unconstrained minimization techniques.\n\nAnother good book is that by Roger Fletcher (1987): Practical methods of\noptimization.\n\nRavi.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n\nRavi Varadhan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, The Center on Aging and Health\n\nDivision of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology \n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nPh: (410) 502-2619\n\nFax: (410) 614-9625\n\nEmail: rvaradhan@jhmi.edu\n\nWebpage:  http://www.jhsph.edu/agingandhealth/People/Faculty/Varadhan.html\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Paul Smith\nSent: Thursday, May 10, 2007 11:08 AM\nTo: R-help\nSubject: [R] Nonlinear constrains with optim\n\nDear All\n\nI am dealing at the moment with optimization problems with nonlinear\nconstraints. Regenoud is quite apt to solve that kind of problems, but\nthe precision of the optimal values for the parameters is sometimes\nfar from what I need. Optim seems to be more precise, but it can only\naccept box-constrained optimization problems. I read in the list\narchives that optim can also be used with nonlinear constrains through\npenalizations. However, I am not familiar with the technique of\npenalizations. Could someone please indicate to me a site or a book to\nlearn about that penalization technique?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
