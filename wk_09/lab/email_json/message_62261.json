Elapsed\ntime is the \"wall clock\" and even though they are both measured in seconds,\nthey are not really the same units.  The reason for the difference is any\n\"idle\" time that they system may have waiting for I/O to complete which does\nnot consume CPU time for your process, but does consume Elasped time.\n\nFor some instances of CPU intensive code (with no I/O of competing tasks),\nthe User + System ~= Elapsed.  Also you have to take into account the\ngranularity of the clock when looking at numbers like 0.04.  So serious\ncomparisons of timing, you want runs of at least 10s of seconds or more.\n\n\nOn 7/4/07, Stefan Grosse  wrote:\n>\n> Gabor Grothendieck wrote:\n> >> set.seed(1)\n> >> C <- sample(c(\"a\", \"b\"), 100000, replace = TRUE)\n> >> system.time(s1 <- ifelse(C == \"a\", 1, -1))\n> >>\n> >    user  system elapsed\n> >    0.37    0.01    0.38\n> >\n> >> system.time(s2 <- 2 * (C == \"a\") - 1)\n> >>\n> >    user  system elapsed\n> >    0.02    0.00    0.02\n> >\n> > system.time(s1 <- ifelse(C == \"a\", 1, -1))\n>   user  system elapsed\n>   0.04    0.01    0.08\n> > system.time(s2 <- 2 * (C == \"a\") - 1)\n>   user  system elapsed\n>      0       0       0\n>\n>\n> I am just wondering: how comes the time does add up to 0.05 while\n> elapsed states 0.08 on my system?
