The docs seem to support my memory:\n\nfrom the Apache docs*\n    Should I Rebuild mod_perl if I have Upgraded Perl?\n    Yes, you should. You have to rebuild the mod_perl enabled server\nsince it has\n    a hard-coded @INC variable. This points to the old Perl and it is\nprobably linked\n    to an old libperl library. If for some reason you need to keep the\nold Perl version\n    around you can modify @INC in the startup script, but it is better\nto build afresh\n    to save you getting into a mess.\n\nThis is not normally a problem on modern Linux boxes because upgrades\noccur through a package management system that upgrades mod_perl at\nthe same time.\n\n* http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#Should_I_Rebuild_mod_perl_if_I_have_Upgraded_Perl_\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
