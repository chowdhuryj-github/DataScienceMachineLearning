But in order to do this I have to\ncreate a file src/Makevars with the following line : PKG_LIBS=$(LAPACK_LIBS)\n$(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)\n\nHowever when I create this file, my package won't build anymore. Actually\nthe checking results in the following :\n\nmingw32\\bin\\ld.exe: cannot find -lg2c\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[3]: *** [PACKAGE.dll] Error 1\nmake[2]: *** [srcDynlib] Error 2\nmake[1]: *** [all] Error 2\nmake: *** [pkg-PACKAGE] Error 2\n*** Installation of PACKAGE failed ***\n\nI've installed all the following tools :\n     mingw-runtime-3.12.tar.gz\n     w32api-3.9.tar.gz\n     binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1.tar.gz\n     gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz\n     gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz\n     gcc-g77-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz\nSo I don't know what to do next for the package to build... Any help would\nbe greatly appreciated.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
