He specifically looked at recent comments by Microsoft's Robbie\nBach saying that 'the video graphics on it aren't very strong; the box\nitself is kind of underpowered; it doesn't play DVDs; there are a lot of\ndown-line components [that] aren't actually that interesting. ... They\ndon't have the graphics horsepower that even Xbox 1 had. So it makes sort\nof the comparison set a little bit difficult.' LevelUp spoke with a pair\nof technical experts at third party publishers and learned that,\nessentially, Bach's comments about horsepower are accurate. However, \"the\n'Gamecube 1.5' moniker, while accurate, doesn't mean that gamers won't\nsee graphical improvements on the Wii. 'There are three main differences\nwhich will result in graphics improvements. One, the increased memory\nclock speed, from 162 megahertz to 243 megahertz, means that it is easier\nto do enough pixels for 480p mode versus 480i. Two, the enhanced memory\nsize of the Wii gives much more room for image-related operations such as\nanti-aliasing, motion blur, etc. The performance to these memory systems\nfrom the graphics chip is also improved. So full-screen effects and\nincreased texture usage seem likely as a result.'\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/11/1324253\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/levelup/archive/2007/05/08/geek-out-xbox-uber-boss-robbie-bach-takes-a-shot-at-nintendo-s-underpowered-wii-does-he-manage-to-score-a-bulls-eye-or-just-shoot-himself-in-the-foot.aspx\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lawsuit Invokes DMCA to Force DRM Adoption                         |\n|   from the interesting-legal-tactic dept.                          |\n|   posted by Zonk on Friday May 11, @10:04 (It's funny.
