If I send more \nthan one color to either function, I only get the first one. If I can \nsort this out, it's easy to use triax.plot to do what you want (unless, \nof course, you are satisfied with lines of one color).\n\nJim\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
