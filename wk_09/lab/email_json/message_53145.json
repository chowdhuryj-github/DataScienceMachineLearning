Some branches are compiler- or OS-specific.\nAs noted in a comment in the module, please consider the issues raised\nin http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=43134.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
