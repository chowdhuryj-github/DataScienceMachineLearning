I'm trying to use R for implementing a neural\nnetwork regression model and apply it to my database. I found three R\npackages (\"AMORE\" , \"grnnR\" , \"neural\") in R website, but their manuals are\nnot really user-friendly in my idea. I was wondering if anyone has a written\ncode in R using any of these packages for a feed-forward back-propagation\nneural network in R that I can use it. That'll be a remedy for my nightmare\nwhich already took quite time from me.\nI would really appreciate it.\n\nSincerely,\nJason.\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
