The relevant line of code is\n(which is part of setting the configuration data):\n\ni_lib_pthread  => 1,                 # XXX fake a header entry\n\nIs this comment necessary, or should it be altered to better reflect\nwhat is happening in the code at this point?  Is there actually a todo\nitem lurking here which isn't obvious?\n\n"}
