Petitions to build new generation plants. Increasing regulatory mandates. Any of these on their own is reason enough to re-evaluate your message to customers. \n\u00a0\nUtilities have many opportunities to communicate with their customers. Rather than be at the mercy of Mother Nature, utilities can be good corporate citizens and effective customer service organizations when they plan in advance and take proactive action. \n\u00a0\nWhen executive strategy dictates the need to upgrade contact with customers, such as fending off calls to the contact center during an outage, informing the customer on latest utility initiatives, or contacting customers before the lights go off, the opportunities arise to upgrade communication systems and processes and start using them for pressing business needs.\n\u00a0\nBy attending EUCI\u2019s 2nd Conference on Customer Communications for Utilities, you will learn first-hand from your fellow utilities how to craft and communicate the most effective strategies and messages. \n\u00a0\nWith networking opportunities built into the program, you will meet fellow utility professionals facing the same obstacles and environments as you are. You will hear utility presenters discuss how to build the business case for customer communication systems, what challenges they faced in approaching their projects, the results and their lessons learned.\n\u00a0\nTarget Audience\n\u00a0\nYou will benefit from attending this conference if you are from the utility industry (gas, electric and diversified, investorowned, and independent) with responsibilities or involvement in the following:\n\n\nCommunications\n\nWeb Services\n\nE-Business Strategy\n\nBilling\n\nContact Center Management\n\nBusiness Planning\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nMarketing\n\nInformation Systems\n\nBusiness Applications\n\nInformation Technology\n\nPublic Relations\n\n\n\nThis conference will also be of interest to companies and consultants that assist the utility industry in developing and implementing communication strategies and technologies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n  Click\n                        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\nClick on any title to download a conference brochure.
