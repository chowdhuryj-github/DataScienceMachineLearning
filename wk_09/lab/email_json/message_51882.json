Why not just write up your own\nalternate S26, redesigning Pod 6 the way you think it should work, and\nthen publish your proposal for consideration here?\n\nAfter all, Larry's track record is clear: he's never once allowed\nsomeone's reputation or status (even his own!) to deter him from\nreplacing an existing design with someone else's superior one.\n\nSo, as you feel you have a better alternative, why not document it and\nput it before the community for consideration and assessment? If it is\nindeed better, I have no doubt we will happily steal it. Even if only\nparts of your proposal are better, your technological distinctiveness\nis sure to be assimilated. ;-)\n\nDamian\n\n"}
