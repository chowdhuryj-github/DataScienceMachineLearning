Can you please run ls -l libspeechd* in\n/usr/lib/ and /usr/local/lib and send the full report so that we can be\nsure?\n\nIt is necessary to install libspeechd to get the latest fix for the\nspeechd-up crashes. Libspeechd has however nothing to do with Speech\nDispatcher crashes. In this regard, the only sensible question is to ask\nwhether you are sure you are running the latest speech dispatcher?\n\nHave a nice day,\nHynek\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
