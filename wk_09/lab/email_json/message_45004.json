A big reason: changes in the regulatory\n              environment, particularly the new NERC Reliability Standards. How can companies assess their situations, prioritize their\n              responses to new requirements, and meet the expectations of regulators, customers and shareholders? Because of the\n              complexity of the NERC Reliability Standards, companies now need to view their entire business applications portfolio as\n            one integrated, complementary and consistent system architecture.\n Business Performance Management (BPM) frameworks help energy organizations achieve compliance and automation in\n                      areas such as planning, budgeting, modeling, and forecasting. Using BPM best practices, organizations collaboratively\n                      align information management processes with planning and reporting functions. Outcomes are based on key performance\n                      indicators (KPIs) to ensure effective performance monitoring. Context is created for long-term analysis and optimization. As a result, BPM becomes a mechanism to unleash the \"right information\" at the \"right time\" in the \"right context\" to\n                      achieve the \"right result\" for complying with the NERC Reliability Standards.\n In this Workshop, you will:\n\n Learn how other companies are addressing the NERC Reliability Standards\n Gain valuable perspectives on the top issues and obstacles for meeting the challenges ahead\n Come away with practical advice through \u201cBest Practices\u201d examples on how to simplify the complexity of the 100 or so\n                        new Reliability Standards and the thousand or so new processes necessary to operate your assets, manage data, report\n                        and audit compliance\n Understand the value of using Business Performance Management to create a foundation to achieve the NERC\n                        Reliability Standards while establishing a framework for continuous improvement to manage the certain changes ahead\n\nWho Will Benefit From This Conference \n\n Generation & transmission executives who need a good understanding of the potential impacts of the NERC Reliability\n                        Standards\n Employees of RTOs, attorneys, and regulators who need to understand the impacts of the new NERC Reliability\n                        Standards on their organization\n Program/Project Managers charged with the responsibility of \u201cSetting the Course\u201d to achieve the new NERC Reliability\n                        Standards\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n
