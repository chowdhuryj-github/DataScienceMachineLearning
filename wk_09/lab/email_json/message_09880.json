I  \ngot automake from macports and the 1.9 is no long listed as a missing  \ndependency, but automake 1.7 still is.\n\nI have libtools but it is showing as a missing dependency. As with  \nexpat.\n\nJames\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
