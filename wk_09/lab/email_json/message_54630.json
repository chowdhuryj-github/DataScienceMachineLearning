I forgot .. another family member turned up unexpectedly\n#Add it explicitely\nrbind(myfamily,c(\"Tango\",\"Tanga\",33))\n# The easy part. Check write.table for other options\nwrite.csv(myfamily,file=\"myfamily.csv\",row.names=FALSE)\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
