I need to come up with a method to use this historical data to\ncome up with a prediction for the future. Even probably try simulating the\nfull history (as in I have history of the job submission time and running\ntime,etc). So I can run through the actual history and at every job\nsubmission, depending on the status of the cluster, try to predict the\nwaiting time. Can I do this using any of the models used in R?\n\nParticularly \"forecast\"...Can I used ARIMA or ARMA for this? ...The problem\nis I don't think I'm dealing with time series because the measurements of\nwaiting times (at a particular state i.e. job submission) ain't done at\nregular intervals. Could anyone please suggest a model for this?\n\nThanking you,\nRS\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
