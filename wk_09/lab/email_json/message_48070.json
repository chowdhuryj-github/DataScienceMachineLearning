There are possible positive outcomes, such as \nthe possibility that Copyright could be amended to clearly allow parody, \nbut it could also be negative in that other events may ask for similar \nexceptions from the due process that otherwise exists in the Trademarks Act.\n\n   It is the whole slippery slope problem for both of these bills.\n\n-- \n  Russell McOrmond, Internet Consultant: \n  Please help us tell the Canadian Parliament to protect our property\n  rights as owners of Information Technology.
