I'd pick up the clubs\nevery summer when my wife and I visited my father, a man who had the good\nsense to live far enough to the south to extend the golf season beyond\nfour or five months of the year.  I enjoyed the game and loved having the\ntime with my Dad. \n\nI'm not much of a golfer in terms of scoring; I've never broken 100 and\nprobably never will.  But while I was at Putnam Investments, I had a\nco-worker who was both good at it and serious about it.  He routinely shot\nin the 80s, and frequently made it into the 70s.  Under his influence I\nplayed much more often (sometimes four or five times a summer), bought a\nnew club (a driver) to go along with the set of clubs I bought in 1964,\nand even made my way to the driving range occasionally. \n\nBut even with this exceptional (for me) level of commitment, I didn't\nimprove much, and I've spent some time figuring out why.  At the same\ntime, I've always enjoyed playing, and I've tried to figure that out, as\nwell, given my fairly low level of accomplishment.  Here's what I've\nfigured out. \n\nWhy I Don't Do Well \n\nFirst, I don't play often enough.  Golf is a physical and mental exercise,\nand building skill requires consistent, committed effort.  Playing once a\nweek (along with trips to the driving range) is probably a bare minimum. \nBut golf is also expensive and time consuming, and I manage to fill the\ndaylight hours of the few warm months that New England offers in a year\nwith lawn and garden work, traveling, going to the beach and hanging out\nwith friends.  That doesn't leave many days free.  If practice makes\nperfect, I'm highly unlikely to make much progress toward perfection. \n\nSecond, I don't take lessons.  I've picked up lots of good tips from\nfriends, occasional viewings of The Golf Channel, and leafing through golf\nmagazines in doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms.  But a brain full of\nmaxims about how to play is no match for the insight of one professional\nwho sees what you're doing wrong and knows how to make you better. \n\nThird, golf demands that you do everything well.  If you break down the\ngame of golf, there are dozens of things that you have to do all at once\n(and time after time) to get the ball from the tee into the hole in a\nrespectable fashion.  Tee the ball up wrong, lift your head, pull the club\nback the wrong way ... there are so many ways to go wrong that it's a\nmiracle it ever works at all.   \n\nWhy I Enjoy It \n\nFirst, sometimes it works!  On a good day, about two out of every five\nshots I hit do exactly what I want them to.  On a really good day, those\ntwo shots will even happen on the same hole, allowing me to experience the\nillusion of competence for a few minutes.  It's immensely satisfying. \n\nSecond, it's good to have a challenge.  If I never do anything outside my\ncomfort zone, I know that I don't have a chance to grow.  And golf, which\nis a constant challenge even for gifted people who work very hard at it,\nwill always be a tantalizing and humbling experience for a duffer like me.\n\n\nThird, it's fun to hit things.  I've played tennis, squash, softball,\nvolleyball and lots of other sports, and I know that hitting things makes\nme feel good.  So much of my work is intensely mental, and there's\nsomething about the sight of a well-struck golf ball soaring in the right\ndirection that's good for the soul.   \n\nYou're probably asking yourself why I'm blathering on about golf in the\nCabot Wealth Advisory.  And the answer is that golf and growth investing\nare incredibly similar in all the important ways. \n\nIf you're going to be good at growth investing, you need to work at it. \nYou need to spend time on it, take lessons in it and be prepared to learn\nall the little maxims and rules associated with it.  And like golf, to be\nreally successful you need to do everything right; find stocks with good\nfundamentals, strong stories and attractive charts, pick the right time to\nbuy, know when to average up in your holdings, and how to sell at the most\nadvantageous time.  And you need to know when the weather is so bad that\nit's not worth playing. \n\nAnd also like golf, you won't always be successful.  Sometimes you think\nyou have the perfect stock and then its earnings report disappoints or the\ncompany gets investigated for backdating options or an analyst downgrades\nit.  You'll get punished for buying too high or holding on too long in a\ndecline.  A mutual fund manager whose decisions are right 51% of the time\nis a hero in the industry.  If you can't tolerate failure, you can't enjoy\neither golf or investing.  Both will keep you humble. \n\nAnd finally, growth investing, like golf can be a lot of fun.  Guessing\nright on a stock and watching its price climb the chart can give you a\nthrill that some people only get from a winning lottery ticket or having\ntheir scale tell them that they've lost five pounds.  If the only thing\ninvestors cared about was never losing money, they'd all buy nothing but\nU.S. Treasury bonds.   \n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nLittle-Known Investment Gets Money Flowing in like Niagara Falls\n\nThere's a group of investments you've probably never heard of that are\nmaking some Americans very rich.\n\nThey're called income trusts, and they give you the most gratifying return\nyou can imagine -- cash now.  Annual yields often run into double digits.\n\nRecently, the government imposed strict new rules on income trusts but\nleft a select group of trusts untouched until 2011.\n\nThis select group of trusts will get richer and richer over the next four\nyears as the trust market shakes out.\n\nThat means you have four more years to reap spectacular profits from these\ncash-rich trusts. But you need clear, specific advice to profit fully from\nthe new income trust market.\n\nThat's exactly why we started the Income Trust Guide: to warn investors\njust like you of the dangers and pitfalls that trap the unwary and to\npoint out the exciting opportunities for profit.\n\nClick on the link below to learn more.\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/174890/13148861/90/0/\n\n-----\n\nIn the ongoing Cabot Paper Portfolio contest, I've had a big winner with\nPrecision Castparts (PCP), a Portland, Oregon company that has found a\nnice market niche in highly specialized castings, forgings and fasteners\nfor the aerospace, industrial and automotive markets.  I added it to my\npaper portfolio at 81 back in January, and it's now trading at about 108. \nThat's a nice win.   \n\nOf course my paper portfolio (which can be pretty aggressive, since\nthere's no real money involved) has also had its shares of clinkers like\nRochester Medical (ROCM), a little company with a better idea for urinary\ncatheters.  I bought it in late March at 22, and watched with pride as it\nheaded toward 30.  Then I took my lumps as it took a four-day dive back to\n17 after reporting disappointing results.  Stay humble. \n\nBut the stock that I'd like to tell you about today is another specialty\nmetals firm that has just come public.  It's called Haynes International\n(HAYN), and it's a Kokomo, Indiana-based company that develops and\nproduces high-performance nickel/cobalt alloys that are used in the\nchemical, aerospace and gas turbine industries, areas where corrosion\nresistance and high temperature resistance are paramount.   \n\nThe company traces its heritage directly to Haynes Stellite Works, a maker\nof metal-cutting tools based on cobalt-chromium-tungsten alloys.  Founded\nin 1912 in Kokomo by Elwood Haynes, the company has a continuous history\nof developing new alloys that can stand up to the demands of high-stress\nenvironments.  Haynes alloys were used in the rocket nozzles that sent\nApollo vehicles to the moon and allowed the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine to\nbreak speed and climbing records in the F15 fighter. \n\nThe stock traded for years on pink sheets, but just listed on the NASDAQ\nin March.  There's really not enough of a chart at this point to create a\nmeaningful pattern, but the trend has been up and the stock is now pulling\nback after hitting resistance at 80 in mid-April.  It's also a thinly\ntraded stock, with an average daily volume of just 251,000 shares.  This,\ntogether with its float of just 11 million shares, may raise its\nvolatility.  But with just eight institutional supporters on the books,\nthe upside potential looks huge. \n\nThis stock hasn't been featured in any of our publications, and it's a bit\nof a gamble; but so is getting into your car for your morning commute. \nWhen it finishes its correction and builds a little base, it might just\nprove to be another winner in this interesting sector, which boasts such\nsuccess stories as Allegheny Technologies (ATI), Titanium Metals (TIE) and\nPrecision Castparts (PCP), which I mentioned above.  The value of Haynes'\nexotic alloys is about as far from the commodity model of copper and gold\nstocks as you can get; the company is rewarded for the intellectual\ncapital that goes into their products.  It's good to have a business that\nrewards R&D and specialized expertise.\n\nPaul Goodwin\nFor Cabot Wealth Advisory\n\n-----\n\nEditor's Note:  As the editor of the Cabot China & Emerging Markets\nReport, Paul Goodwin has had the good fortune to hit some nice long drives\nthat have put the Report at the top of the leader board among all\nfinancial newsletters.\n\nCheck out the explosive profits of the fast-growing opportunities Paul\nrecommends.
