Is there some way to get to know the estiamtes at each iteration? When I put \"control=list(trace=TRUE)\" as an option in \"optim\", I just got the initial and final values of the loglikelihood, number of iterations and whether the routine has converged or not. I need to know the estimate values at each iteration.\n\nDeepankar\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
