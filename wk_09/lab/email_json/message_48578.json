I\nhave joined this box to Active Directory however when I log in using Winbind\nit does not give me a ticket when I log in I have to use pam_krb5.so if I\nwant a Kerberos Ticket for every user that log in my system.\n\nis it possible to tell winbind to give each user a Kerberos ticket rather\nthan having everyone issuing the kinit command?\n\nSecond question is, I heard Samba supports Kerberos and I have compiled it\nwith Kerberos support, when I log in my box using the pam_krb5.so PAM module\nand I try to open a Network Share where I have rights it does prompt me for\na password unlikely winbind where this didnt happen.\n\nPlease, any help on this matter will be extremely appreciated.\n\nJohn\n\n"}
