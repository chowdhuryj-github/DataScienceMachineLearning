The decision follows a hearing at IPONZ on the\npatentability of Swiss claims where the novelty of the claimed\nsubject matter resides in a dosage regime, rather than the active\ningredient or the disease to be treated.\n\nThe patent application is jointly owned by Genentech and Washington\nUniversity. The active ingredient of the claims, insulin-like growth\nfactor-1 (IGF-1), was previously known for treating various diseases,\nbut patients suffered from side effects and the particular problem\nthat continuous treatment rendered IGF-1 ineffective over time. The\napplicants had found that intermittent treatment using IGF-1\nmaximised efficacy and minimized side effects.\n\nNew Zealand does not allow patents for methods of medically treating\nhumans. This position is in line with the vast majority of countries,\nthe notable exceptions being the US and Australia. However, following\na decision of the Court of Appeal in 2000, known as the Pharmac case\n(Pharmaceutical Management Agency Ltd v The Commission of Patents\n[2000] RPC 857), Swiss claims have been allowable in New Zealand.\nSwiss claims effectively protect a new use of a known pharmaceutical\ningredient.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of relevant case law by IPONZ has been\nrather restrictive and is reflected in its Guidelines for the\nExamination of Swiss-type Claims that were issued in September 2006.\nThe Guidelines considered the conflicting positions of the UK and\nEurope. The UK Court of Appeal in the Bristol-Myers Taxol case\n(Bristol-Myers Squibb v Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals [2001] RPC 1)\nrefused to allow a Swiss claim having a faster administration rate as\nits novel feature. In contrast, the decision of the EPO in the\nGenentech case (T1020/03) allowed claims equivalent to those that\nwere the subject of the New Zealand decision. The Guidelines\ncontroversially concluded that the novelty must reside in the newly\ndiscovered purpose (of the known pharmaceutical) and not the mode of\nadministration or the amount, timing or frequency of dosage.\n\nThe latest New Zealand decision reviewed the UK and European\ndecisions, as well as earlier IPONZ decisions on the issue, and\ndisagreed with the statement in the Guidelines that claims of this\ntype are not valid Swiss claims. The IPONZ decision noted that the\napplicants had produced a means of overcoming or alleviating problems\nassociated with the continued use of IGF-1 and that it was proper\nthat they should be able to obtain patent protection for their\ncontribution. The decision went on to explain that the only contrary\nview was that expressed by the UK Court of Appeal in the Bristol-\nMyers Taxol case, and that case, although persuasive, was not binding\nin New Zealand nor had it been followed by later European Board of\nAppeal cases.\n\nThe decision represents a positive step forward for many in the\npharmaceutical industry, and reflects the continued expansion of\nareas of pharmaceutical innovation that can be patented in New Zealand.\n\nGreg Lynch\n\n----------------------------------------------\nJames Packard Love\nKnowledge Ecology International\nmailto:james.love@keionline.org\ntel. +1.202.332.2670 / U.S. mobile+1.202.361.3040, Geneva mobile\n+41.76.413.6584\n\n\"If everyone thinks the same: No one thinks.\" Bill Walton\"\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIp-health mailing list\nIp-health@lists.essential.org\nhttp://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health\n\n"}
