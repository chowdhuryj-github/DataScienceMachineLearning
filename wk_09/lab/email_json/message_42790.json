Debian delayed moving FDL'd stuff to non-free for over a\nyear after the problem was noticed, waiting on promised FSF cooperation.\nI think a full release went out in the meantime.  As I understand it,\nit was FSF asking us to wait because they were busy with things and then\nthe GPLv3.\n\nI think the Debian project was more than willing to help resolve this\namicably, but FSF seemed determined to keep the non-free-software aspects\nof FDL and was just yanking our chain.  Even then, some FDL'd\nmaterial got a special approval into main.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
