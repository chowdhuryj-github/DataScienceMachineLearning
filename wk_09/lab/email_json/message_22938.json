I'm currently checking @ARGV to do this i.e. if \nthere is data in @ARGV then it was called from the command line, but \nobviously this means there must be command line arguments and I'm also \nnot sure whether there could sometimes be arguments in @ARGV when called \nthrough CGI?\n\nIs there a better way to check?\n\nTIA\n\nCheers,\nNigel\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
