First, you're probably having the\nlinks repeating issue when arrowing, because you have cursor tracking\nset to on. I personally turn it off when browsing, because I'm used to\nhow speakup reads in lynx that way, though highlight tracking may do\nbetter here, I don't know.\n\nSecond, as far as I know, lynx doesn't number forms such as the search\nbox in google. If you come to a text box that doesn't speak, use your\nread previous line key to find out what it is. \n\nI personally find it cumbersome to navigate the page by using the arrow\nkeys. This isn't browse mode/msaa/whatever your windows screen reader\ncalls it. What I personally do is to use the read screen key, memorize\nthe number of the link I want to check out, and either stop reading at\nthat point, or wait for speakup to finish reading the screen if I'm\ninterested in what else is there. For the times I do want to browse\nline by line, I use the speakup review keys, and then use the slash\nkey to search for where I want to go to, arrive on that link, and hit\nenter.\n\nThis is how I personally browse in lynx, and others may prefer to do\nit differently. Use whatever methods work for you here.
