If the former,\nthen there aren't any \"fitted\" values to be gotten.\n\n   Perhaps if you say a little more about the problem you're trying\nto solve you will get more useful help.\n\n  Also see http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/06/09/0133.html\nand the answers to it.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
