It does not support application/foo+xml.\n\nDoes anyone know of a workaround which would allow me to avoid having to \npublish resources with the wrong (application/xml) type?  If I do have to \npublish with the wrong type, does anyone know of a method which would \nallow me to minimize the damage?\n\nThis is important because it is a limiting factor for all XML-based \nformats.\n\nThank you.\n\n-Lucas Gonze\n\n"}
