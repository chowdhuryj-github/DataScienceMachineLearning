These scripts will just check to see if a specific component\nis enabled or disabled, and then turn that component on or off.  I was\nthinking this would be easier than having to go into device manager\nevery single time I wanted to start up a USB slot or something.  If\nanyone knows of any module that I could use to be able to access the\ndevice manager it would be alot of help.\n\nThanks for any replies,\n\nDustin\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
