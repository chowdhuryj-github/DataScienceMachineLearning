While you're asking,\nwhy not ask for it as free software?  Even one with an obnoxious ad\nclause (so they get their attribution) would be an improvement.\n\nHope that helps,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
