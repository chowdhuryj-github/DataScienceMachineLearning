Though you will have to do a little homework to\nconfigure it.\n\nStart here, and then look for the many excellent hand-holding\ntutorials online. The key concept is that Mutt does mail like nobody's\nbusiness but you need other small Unix tools (like, eg Exim or\nSendmail to SEND the mail; fetchmail or getmail to GET the mail; and\nMaildrop or Procmail to put the mail in the right boxes.)  Read about\nhow this works FIRST. Then install. If you like keyboarding, then Mutt\nis for you. You can lose your mouse and not even notice for hours at a\ntime.\n\nhttp://mutt.blackfish.org.uk/\n\n> access to my gmail account since this one uses ssl encryption (and I didn't\n> manage to make it work).\n\nThere are tutorials for this. I did it two weeks ago. The getting is\neasy. The sending is a bit trickier. Try searching on \"Exim gmail ssl\"\nor variations thereof.\n\nbs\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
