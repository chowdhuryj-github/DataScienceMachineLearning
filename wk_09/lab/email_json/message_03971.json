Totem still doesn't work, and that's fine with me. What I noticed was that on my Windows XP share where I had enabled everyone access (i.e. - Everyone had RWE access) I was able to stream to Kaffeine just fine, but on the SMB share from another Linux platform it would give me the same error you're getting.\n\nMy thought was that Kaffeine didn't have permissions on that drive even though I had logged in to the network share through the file browser. So I changed the share properties to allow everyone access without putting in a password. When I ran the files now by right-clicking and choosing \"Open with Kaffeine\" it worked!\n\nI then tested the opposite - If I changed the properties on my Windows XP share to allow only one user access I could easily put in my username/password and browse the share but I could not play files in kaffeine or any other media player for that matter.\n\nSo the end result is this - whether you're using a windows machine as the host or a linux machine as the host you have to open your permissions to allow full unrestricted access to the share without a password. This solution worked for me, let me know if that also works for you.\n\n\n-- Michael Boratko\nShameless plug for [url=http://www.starstreak.com]Computer Repair and Website Design[/url]\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
