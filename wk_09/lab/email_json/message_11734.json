(For those  \nimpatient, you can use http://r.research.att.com as a mirror to get  \nthe updated packages right now).\n\nCheers,\nSimon\n\nPS: To all: for Mac-related issues, please, always use R-SIG-Mac -  \nread it and post there if you have problems. I usually try to respond  \nASAP.\n\n\n> On Apr 19, 2007, at 5:47 AM, Byron Ellis wrote:\n>\n>> Actually it appears that a variety of packages are doing this\n>> (gtools did it to me earlier today).
