John McCain cited the alleged Fort Dix terror\nplot in defending the immigration deal worked out earlier in the day.\n\n\"The Fort Dix situation indicated when you have people who have been here a long time illegally and try to kill\nAmericans, indicates we've got to account for these people who are in the country illegally,\" the Arizona senator, who\nis seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said outside a fundraiser.\n\nMcCain has come under fire from some conservatives for his stance on immigration -- which is in line with President\nBush's goal.\n\n-- CNN Political Desk Managing Editor Steve Brusk\n\n=================================================================\nPolitical Hot Topics\n(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)\n\n\"DELICATE COMPROMISE\" REACHED ON IMMIGRATION: The Bush administration and a bipartisan group of senators reached\nagreement yesterday on a sprawling overhaul of the nation's immigration laws that would bring an estimated 12 million\nillegal immigrants out of society's shadows while stiffening border protections and cracking down on employers of\nundocumented workers. The delicate compromise, 380 pages long and three months in the making, represents perhaps the\nlast opportunity for President Bush to win a major legislative accomplishment for his second term, and it could become\nthe most significant revision of the nation's immigration system in 41 years. Bush hailed the agreement as \"one that\nwill help enforce our borders, but equally importantly, it will treat people with respect.\" Washington Post: Deal on\nImmigration Reached http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051700253.html\n\nNO-CONFIDENCE VOTE PLANNED ON GONZALES: Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's standing in Congress weakened further on\nThursday as Senate Democrats arranged to hold a no-confidence vote and the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee predicted that the furor over Mr. Gonzales's stewardship would end with his resignation. Mr. Gonzales's\nalready shaky position eroded after reports this week about an episode in 2004 when as White House counsel he was\ninvolved in an apparent effort to circumvent Justice Department officials who had refused to renew authority for a\nsecret domestic eavesdropping program. And Thursday, The Washington Post identified several United States attorneys who\nappeared on various Justice Department lists in 2005 and 2006 as potential candidates for dismissal.

Wolfowitz, 63, said he will step down at the end of June. His resignation will touch off a search for a new\npresident by the board's executive directors. Established in 1944, the World Bank has traditionally been headed by an\nAmerican. But that could change. Even the name of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is leaving office next month,\nhas been floated in some quarters.

In an\noccasionally nostalgic press conference that featured each leader praising the other for his steadfast resolve, Mr.\nBlair said that even though his term in office is being cut short by the unpopular war, he still would choose to commit\nBritish forces to the worldwide fight against terrorism. \"You can debate about the mistakes and the issues and you can\ndebate about Iraq, whether we should have done this or we should have done that,\" said the normally cool Mr. Blair,\nbristling at a question from a British reporter. \"I would take the same position of alliance with America again... I\nthought then, and I think now, it was the right decision,\" he said.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) is the only presidential candidate in\nCongress to have missed a major vote on the Iraq war this year, and his absences are not sitting well with Senate\nMajority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Liz Oxhorn, a spokeswoman for Reid, told The Hill, \"Sen. McCain has spent\nconsiderable time defending the president on Iraq and catering to the Republican base on immigration, but has only\nmanaged to show up for four of the last 14 Iraq votes and parachute into [yesterday's] immigration press conference at\nthe last minute.

Wilson IV. The officials, who include\nsenior White House adviser Karl Rove and Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, argued that the\njudge should dismiss a lawsuit filed by the couple that stemmed from the disclosure of Plame's identity to the media.\nThe suit claims that Cheney, Libby, Rove and former deputy secretary of state Richard L. Armitage violated the couple's\nprivacy and constitutional rights by publicly revealing Plame's identity in an effort to retaliate against Wilson.\nWashington Post: Judge Told Leak Was Part of 'Policy Dispute'\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051701400.html\n\nMEMBERS SPEND MILLIONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS: Two dozen current and former members of\nCongress caught up in criminal investigations or ethics inquiries spent more than $5 million in campaign funds on legal\nfees during the last 27 months covered by campaign-finance records. The spending reflects a spate of scandals that were\na factor in the Democratic takeover of Congress last year and, for some lawmakers, remain a problem. Eight current\nmembers have been publicly identified as being under investigation. While campaign donations may not be spent for\npersonal use, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has ruled that fighting to stay out of jail is a legitimate\npolitical activity as long as the allegations of wrongdoing relate to conduct in office.

But as she now tries to pass lobbying reforms, she's facing strong resistance from a surprising corner --\nher veteran Democratic colleagues. The House Judiciary Committee passed new ethics legislation Thursday, but only after\nseveral days of backroom deal-making where some of the toughest proposed reforms were left on the cutting-room floor.\nAt a Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday, several longtime lawmakers objected to the effort to force lobbyists to\ndisclose when they \"bundled\" campaign checks, which they argued would make it harder to raise money.

ROGERS WILL SEEK REPRIMAND OF REP. MURTHA: Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) threatened to deny any further spending\nprojects to a Republican who challenged him over an earmark, his antagonist has charged -- a potential violation of\nHouse rules. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had challenged money that Murtha inserted into an intelligence bill last week.\nRogers turned the tables later that night by saying he would propose a reprimand of Murtha for violating House rules.\nThe Republican is planning to insert a transcript of their exchange in the Congressional Record to document the\npotential violation. The privileged resolution will also require a House vote to reprimand Murtha for his comments,\naccording to a copy received by Politico.

The\ndilemma is particularly pointed for black elected officials such as [State Rep. Robert] Ford, who are faced with a\nfield that includes three candidates -- Edwards, Clinton and Obama -- with strong claims on African American voters.\nThe black vote is projected to account for half of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina's January primary,\nraising the stakes for candidates trying to win support from black leaders. In Florida, which has moved its primary up\nto Jan. 29, black voters are nearly a quarter of the Democratic electorate.

Obama, who has hyped his 2002 opposition to the Iraq invasion, ripped the former first lady after being\nasked on MSNBC about her husband, Bill Clinton's, recent remark that Obama's \"voting record and Hillary's are almost\nidentical, I think, on all the relevant issues.\" \"I suppose that's true if you leave out the fact that she authorized\nit and supported it, and I said it was a bad idea,\" Obama shot back. \"That's a fairly major difference.\" He stayed on\nthe attack by accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of trying to blur her transition from an Iraq hawk to one of the war's\nmost vocal critics. New York Post: OBAMA OPENS FIRE ON HILL'S WAR VOTE http://www.nypost.com/\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA'S \"STARRING ROLE\": It was a triumphant moment for Barack Obama: He was walking through the Capitol for\nthe very first time as a United States senator in January 2005, trailed by photographers, hangers-on, and finally, his\namused wife. Rolling her eyes as she pulled a reporter aside, Michelle Obama said, \"Maybe one day, he will do something\nto warrant all this attention.\" Two years and one presidential announcement later, the sarcasm is gone, and a woman who\nhas said she dislikes politics is assuming a starring role in her husband's campaign for the White House.

An Edwards campaign spokesman said the former Democratic senator from\nNorth Carolina would sell thousands of dollars of Sudan-related funds. \"He did not know about it and will divest,\" Eric\nSchultz said following inquiries about Edwards' portfolio. Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York, has at\nleast one investment of between $500,000 and $1 million in a fund that holds stock in a company that is active in\nSudan. \"The mayor was unaware of this connection, but is taking it very seriously,\" spokeswoman Maria Comella said.

A day after the former mayor disclosed in federal filings that he considers his third wife, Judith, a\nsalaried employee, sources said he has paid her about $125,000 a year for speechwriting help - since before they were\nmarried. The tidy sums, which the couple have always reported as income on their joint tax returns, was for\nspeech-writing help and the many days Judith spent traveling with her husband to paid engagements around the globe.\n\"Mrs. Giuliani made a professional contribution and the mayor recognizes and respects her efforts,\" one aide said. \"He\nis merely acknowledging both her time commitment and her professional value.\" New York Post: In Rudy's heart & on\npayroll http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/05/18/2007-05-18_in_rudys_heart__on_payroll-2.html\n\nCANDIDATES TALK UP THEIR UNION CREDENTIALS: Democrats looking to boost their 2008 presidential hopes wooed thousands of\nunion members on the National Mall Thursday, promising to reverse what they called a long-standing anti-labor stance by\nPresident Bush. \"I'm ready to be the person who puts labor's flag right on the White House's lawn,\" said Rep. Dennis\nKucinich, D-Ohio, one of several Democratic candidates who took the stage at the International Association of\nMachinists and Aerospace Workers-sponsored rally. Kucinich, along with Sens. Joe Biden of Delaware and Hillary Clinton\nof New York, talked up their union credentials to the blue-shirted activists who gathered a couple of blocks away from\nthe Capitol. \"Are you ready for a president who is actively pro-labor and is going to appoint people who actually care\nabout workers rights?\" Clinton asked the crowd.
