Try to test all branches and conditions; consult a recent code\ncoverage report for guidance.  See if you can write tests which generate\nthe 'die's, then capture the error messages and analyze them.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
