Ebay User Agreements are not law\nand Debian is not bound to it.  \n\nThe _use_ of the program might be a violation of the Ebay User\nAgreement, but it's not clear to me that such a restriction is legal in\nall juristictions, and I'm not even sure that the entire concept of a\nclick-through \"User Agreement\" is legal everywhere.  In any case, it's\nthe user who needs to decide whether or not he want to use it.\n\nThat being said, it would of course be nice if the program would make\nclear to the user that Ebay doesn't like the program being used, in\norder for the user to make an informed decision. (I have no idea if the\nprogram is already doing that or not.)\n\nGreetings,\nBas.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
