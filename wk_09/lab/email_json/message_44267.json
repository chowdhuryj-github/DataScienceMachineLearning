I did how described in the R-Win-FAQ create a\n.Renviron File containing the path to the win-library that R already\ncreated (R_LIBS=C: ... ). I also tried to add R_LIBS= as Rgui parameter\nfrom within Tinn-R. Additionally I tried to leave a file named\nRenviron.site in the etc library. Nothing worked thus far.\n\nInterestingly installing packages does work fine even without specifying\nthe R_LIBS path manually with any of the above mentioned methods.\n\nEven more puzzling is that even when I install eg. nlme manually via\ninstall.packages(\"nlme\") it works but R still wants to update it. Even\nthough e.g. library(nlme), ?nlme shows that the latest version is\ninstalled.\n\nI would guess there is some problem with the library path variable in\nthe update program...\n\nStefan\n\n\n-------- Original Message  --------\nSubject: Re:[R] update packages with R on Vista: error\nFrom: Prof Brian Ripley \nTo: Stefan Grosse \nDate: 07.06.2007 13:01\n> See the rw-FAQ, which describes this in detail.\n>\n> Almost certainly you are trying to update the package 'cluster' which\n> is in the main library.
