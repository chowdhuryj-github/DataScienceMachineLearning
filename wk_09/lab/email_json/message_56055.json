What am I doing wrong?\n\nIn 2007, the US moved daylight savings to March 11 instead of the more traditional\nfirst weekend in April.  It continues to November 4, a week later than before.\nGoogle \"daylight savings 2007\" for lots of background.\n\nSome MS programs did not make the switch until April 1, therefore my calendars\ndoubled up continuing appointments.\n\n>From your experience, it looks like some programs are retroactively misapplying\nthe change to 2006.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
