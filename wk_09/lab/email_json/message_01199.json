I was shocked by the quote for\nour 28-core Scyld cluster--- the annual fee was a few times the total\ncost of our hardware.  We ended up buying a new quad 3GHz Opterons box\nwith 32GB ram just so that the fee for SAS on such a box would be more\ntolerable.  It just boggles my mind that the right to use SAS for a year\nis about the price of a nice four-bedroom house (near SAS Institute!).\nI don't understand people who rather pay that kind of price for the\nsoftware, instead of spending the money on state-of-the-art hardware and\nsave more than a bundle.\n\nJust my $0.02...\nAndy\n\nFrom: Jorge Cornejo-Donoso\n> \n> I have a Dell with 2 Intel XEON 3.0 procesors and 2GB of ram....\n> The problem is the DB size. \n> \n> -----Mensaje original-----\n> De: Gabor Grothendieck [mailto:ggrothendieck@gmail.com] \n> Enviado el: Lunes, 09 de Abril de 2007 11:28\n> Para: Jorge Cornejo-Donoso\n> CC: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n> Asunto: Re: [R] Reasons to Use R\n> \n> Have you tried 64 bit machines with larger memory or do you \n> mean that you can't use R on your current machines?\n> \n> Also have you tried S-Plus?
