I have two Linux\nsystems, each behind a firewall that permits anything to go out, but\naccepts connections from only specified ports. I have ports 20 and 21\nopen on both machines. One machine runs an ftp server, vsftpd, and the\nother uses the standard ftp client. Everything works great: logging in,\nuploading, downloading, the works.\n\nExcept I want to implement passive mode on the server. My concern is\nabout my firewalls. Should I open other ports to support passive mode?\nShould they be server side ports or client side ports? None of the\ndocumentation I have discusses firewall issues, except to say passive\nmode is useful when the client is behind a firewall. But what about\nwhen the server is also behind a similar firewall?\n\nAnybody have vsftpd working with passive mode? How in heck did you do\nit?\n\nThanks,\nChuck\n\n-- \nThe Moon is Full\n My home page with some downloads is at http://www.mhcable.com/~chuckh\n The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
