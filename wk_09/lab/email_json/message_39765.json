All the game content, sounds and graphics are licensed under Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution license ( \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ ).As I understand, CC-by 3.0 is DFSG-free. The only potentially DFSG-freeness problem I can see is the DRM limitation, and then again GNU FDL also has it and is perfectly DFSG according to the last GR about it.\nAnyway, I prefer to ask about it first: Does anyone know if CC-by 3.0 is DFSG-free or not for sure, shall I go ahead and put it in the repositories?Greetings and thanks,Miry\n\n"}
