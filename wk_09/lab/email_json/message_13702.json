It was almost useless due to the ugly presentation\nbut I did some tweaks and it's still missing some bits, see:\n\n\n* bzr branch http://bzr.debian.org/bzr/reportbug-ng\n* aptitude install pyqt-tools kde-style-klearlook qt3-qtconfig\n* cd reportbug-ng\n* make\n* ./reportbug-ng\n\nwow, scary, no?\n\n* qtconfig\n\nIt doesn't really matter what default GUI style you pick, the font\nmatters a lot. We might use the same family as in GNOME, IMHO. I'm\nunable to make the grey in qt apps looks the same as in gtk+ apps. Is\nthis a color palette issue? If yes, qt3-qtconfig (and maybe\nqt4-qtconfig) are broken. Let's go fix their defaults and send patches\nfor the maintainers. Thoughts? :)\n\nI think the side effect of this fix is that Xfce will also benefit.\nCould somebody using KDE and GTK+ apps inform us about gtk-qt-engine\nusage?\n\nThe best scenario for us is simple list qt3-qtconfig, qt4-qtconfig and\nmaybe kde-style-klearlook into buth gnome-desktop and xfce-desktop\ntasks and gtk-qt-engine into kde-desktop task and it just works.\n\nFeedback is appreciated.\n\nthanks in advance,\n-- stratus\nhttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
