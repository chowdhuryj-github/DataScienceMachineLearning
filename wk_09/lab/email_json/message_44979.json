There are a couple of ways to do\nthis.  First, find the range of values from all of your plots then use\nthis as the argument to xlim and ylim for each plot.  Second, create the\nfirst plot then use par('usr') to find what the limits of the\ncoordinates are, then use these values for xlim/ylim in further plots\n(using xaxs/yaxs='i' so the extra 4% is not added). Third, there are\nprobably other ways, but the above should get you started.\n\n\n\n \n> 2) In S-Plus I could fix \"scientific notation\" or \"normal \n> notation\" in output\n> ->How can I handle this in R ?\n> I found no fix in the documentation\n\nLook at options('scipen'), this is not exactly fixing it like S-PLUS,\nbut could solve most your problems.\n\n> \n> I am using R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18) on Windows XP SR2\n> \n> \n> Peter Lercher, M.D., M.P.H., Assoc Prof\n> \n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
