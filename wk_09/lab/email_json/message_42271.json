If the sequencing\nsoftware is non-free, then the WAV files build-depend on a non-free\ncomponent.  It is the same as if you used a non-free compiler to\ncreate an executable.  If the soundfonts are GPL compatible, that\nwould put the WAV's in contrib.\n\nCheers,\nWalter Landry\nwlandry@ucsd.edu\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
