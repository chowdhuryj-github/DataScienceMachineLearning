Three access lawyers refute their\ncontentions point-by-point.\n\nWorld's \"Premiere\" Law Firm Goes to Bat for Abbott:  Specious Arguments on\nThailand's Compulsory Licenses\nProfessor Brook K. Baker, Health GAP and Northeastern U. School of Law,\nProfessor Sean Flynn, American University, Judit Rius Sanjuan, KEI\nApril 23, 2007\n\nBaker & McKenzie proclaims itself as the world's leading global law firm,\nso it's no surprise that this 3400 attorney firm with $1.5 billion in\nannual billings would go to bat for another big enterprise, Abbott\nLaboratories, now locked in an intense battle with Thailand over the\nlegality and propriety of a government use license issued for\nKaletra/Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir), a key AIDS medicine, issued on\nJanuary 24, 2007 (Peerapan Tungsuwan and William McKay, Compulsory drug\nlicenses violate world trade treaty, Bangkok Post, April 23, 2007).\nContrary to its reputation, and more likely for the benefit of its Big\nPharma clients including Abbott, Aventis, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and\nEli Lilly, the Baker & McKenzie attorneys have purposefully misread and\nmisrepresented the WTO TRIPS Agreement and wrongfully concluded that\nThailand's license are unlawful.\n\nThe authors make four TRIPS-related arguments, all of which mischaracterize\nthe law.\n\nTungsuwan and McKay first challenge the proposition that Thailand is\njustified in issuing compulsory licenses on the grounds that \"public health\ninterest must come before commercial interests,\" belittling those grounds\nas comparable to acquiring beds in private hospitals.  The authors are\nfully capable of reading Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, which contains\nno express limitation whatsoever on the grounds upon which a compulsory\nlicense can be granted.  The primacy of public health and public health's\nvalidity as a ground for licenses, for cost-saving reasons or otherwise,\nwas confirmed in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public\nHealth of Nov. 2001 especially in paragraph 5(b) which reads:  \"Each Member\nhas the right to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine the\ngrounds upon which such licenses are granted.\"  Thus, if Thailand wants to\nconserve resources in its world renowned HIV/AIDS treatment program, that\ndecision is 100% lawful.\n\nNext, the two Baker & McKenzie lawyers argue that Thailand's government use\nlicenses are not for \"public, non-commercial use\" because they have been\ngranted to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization, a publicly owned\nmanufacturer and drug distribution agency.  Since the license is allegedly\nnot for public, non-commercial use, the authors argue that Thailand was\nrequired to negotiate on commercially reasonable terms with the patent\nholder before issuing the license and that it failed to do so.   In making\nthis argument, they acknowledge, as they must, that prior negotiations are\nnot required for public, commercial use licenses; they fail to acknowledge,\nhowever, that Thailand had in fact engaged in fruitless discussions with\npatent holders since 2005.\n\nContrary to the authors' argument, the \"public, non-commercial use\"\nlanguage of Article 31(b) of the TRIPS Agreement is focused on the \"use\"\nmade of the licensed product, not who the manufacturer or distributor is.\nHere, the use is clear - Thailand will only use the licensed\nlopinavir/ritonavir within its national public health insurance schemes.\nIndeed,  Abbott will retain its exclusive rights to sell in Thailand's\nsmall private sector where it can continue to charge its exorbitant\nmonopoly prices.   As apologists for Abbott, the authors would have us\nbelieve that licensees such as the GPO cannot make medicines for profit\n(not true), or that it's cheating when a locally owned public manufacturer\nmakes or imports a licensed product from abroad (nothing could be further\nfrom the truth).  The compulsory licensing provisions of Article 31 permit\nlicenses to be granted to public or private, and domestic or foreign\nentities.\n\nThe authors third argument is that the .05% royalty rate is unlawful\nbecause it is not adequate and because it does not take into account the\n\"economic value of the authorization.\"  The authors continue with a\ntruthful observation that customary royalty are higher elsewhere.  While it\nis true that royalty must be set fairly, TRIPS merely requires a review\nremedy if the patent holder feels the royalty is inadequate.  Section 51 of\nthe Patent Act provides for such an appeal, and in fact Thailand has\ninvited Abbott to several meetings to discuss the royalty.  Instead of\nappealing, however, Abbott has now decided to boycott royalty rate setting\ndiscussions.\n\nThe authors' final argument about the \"individual merits\" of licenses is\nplainly preposterous.  Once again arguing that prior negotiations are\nrequired, the high-powered lawyers argue that Thailand cannot consider any\nlicense on its individual merits if it has not engaged in \"prior\nconsultations with the affected party.\"  Contrary to their claim, Thailand\nunsuccessfully engaged in such discussions for several years.  More to the\npoint, however, the TRIPS Agreement expressly permits issuance of licenses\nfor emergencies, matters of extreme urgency, and public, non-commercial use\nwithout prior negotiations (Article 31(b)).  Pursuant to this international\nstandard and in compliance with its own law, 28 U.S.C. sec. 1498(a) and\nU.S. Executive Order 12889 , the U.S. and its contractors routinely issue\npublic, non-commercial use licenses without prior notice or negotiation,\nfor example to military hardware patents for its favored defense\ncontractors Lockheed-Martin and Halliburton.\n\nThese highly skilled lawyers are not stupid and they do know how to read.\nThey must be well aware of the authoritative scholarly interpretations of\nthe TRIPS Agreement, which clearly do not support their specious arguments.\nHowever, high fees can buy twisted logic.  Here, the false arguments\nthreaten to obscure the legality of Thailand's compulsory licenses and by\nnecessary extension threaten access to life saving medicines.  In the U.S.\nlegal system, we have sanctions for frivolous arguments.  Here the authors\nare seeking to mislead the court of public opinion rather than a judicial\ntribunal.  That may make their offense even worse.\n\nProfessor Brook K. Baker, Health GAP\nNortheastern U.

The ministry proclaims CL is \"a form\nof social movement that aims at improving access to essential medicines and\nthe health of people\".\n\n\nIn spite of substantial increases in budget expenditure in other areas, the\nministry justifies CL by asserting that patented pharmaceuticals are too\nexpensive for the Thai budget. It proclaims that the \"public health\ninterest must come before commercial interests\".\n\n\nWith this line of reasoning, the ministry might just as well announce that\nit will be compulsorily acquiring beds in private hospitals. Private beds\nare undoubtedly too expensive. Such an action would also improve access and\nplace public health before commercial interests.\n\n\nPerhaps sensing that it needs to find some additional rationale, the\nministry also asserts that its CL is in \"full compliance with the Thai\nnational and international framework\". In this context, this means in full\ncompliance with section 51 of the Thai Patents Act and Article 31 of the\nWorld Trade Organisation's Agreement On Trade Related Aspects of\nIntellectual Property Rights (Trips).\n\n\nIn reality, we think the ministry has failed to comply with Trips in a\nnumber of important respects. In this article we will explain why this is\nso. In the next article, we will discuss what might be done about it.\n\n\nFirst, we believe the ministry has failed to comply with Article 31(b) of\nTrips because it did not have prior consultations with patent holders. In\nour view, the CLs in favour of the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation\n(GPO) are for commercial use, not for \"public non-commercial use\" as the\ngovernment claims and as required by Article 31 (b).\n\n\nSecond, the ministry has failed to comply with Article 31(h) of Trips\nbecause the royalty rates stipulated (0.05% in every case) are not\n\"adequate\" and fail to take into account the \"economic value of the\nauthorisation\" (the CL).\n\n\nAnd third and most important, the ministry has failed to comply with\nArticle 31(a) because it has not considered each case \"on its own merits\".\n\n\nLet's discuss each of these failures in more detail:\n\n\nFailure to Consult: Article 31(b) of Trips mandates prior consultations\nwith the patent holder except in cases of emergency or \"public\nnon-commercial use\". The ministry does not claim there is an emergency.\nHowever, it does assert that the CLs in favour of the GPO are for a\n\"non-commercial purpose\".\n\n\nWe think the GPO's use of the CL will be for a commercial purpose. In fact,\nSection 6(5) of the GPO Act states that the GPO carries on \"business\".\nSections 34 and 35 reinforce this basic objective.\n\n\nFor example, legislators envisaged the organisation making a surplus and\nhaving an obligation to pay this surplus to the government. The GPO also\nhas joint ventures with private pharmaceutical companies. In the past, some\nwanted the GPO privatised.\n\n\nThe GPO will be selling the products for which Thailand is issuing CLs. The\nroyalty obligations are expressed as a percentage of the GPO's \"sale\nvalue\". In short, the activities are commercial, both in form and\nsubstance. They do not cease to be such simply because the GPO is owned by\nthe government.\n\n\nContrary to what the Public Health Ministry asserts in its white paper,\nSection 51 of the Patents Act is in fact silent on the issue of whether\nthere ought to be prior consultations with the patent holder. However,\nArticle 31(b) of Trips does say negotiations are required if the CL is\nissued for commercial use, and we think the ministry has failed to comply.\n\n\nInadequate Royalty Rate: The royalty rate of 0.05% of the GPO's sales value\nis not \"adequate\" and does take into account the \"economic value\" of the CL\nas required by Article 31(h) of Trips. The sales value, and hence the\neconomic value, of each product varies. Prima facie, one would expect that\nthe royalty rates for each product should vary. But they do not. The rate\nis the same for all three products.\n\n\nThere is some curious logic in the White Paper. The ministry asserts that\nsince the GPO will charge high retail prices for the products, royalty\nrates paid to the patent holders should be low.\n\n\nThe opposite conclusion is more apt. If prices are high, royalty rates\nought also to be high to provide adequate compensation to the patent\nholder. To make the royalty rate \"adequate\" within the meaning of Article\n31(h), authorities should assess what rate might be applicable if this was\na voluntary licensing situation, not just a CL situation.\n\n\nIn our experience, rates in voluntary licensing situations would be much\nhigher, typically in the range of at least 5% to 7.5 %, and quite possibly\nsubstantially more. In one recent case in South Africa, a 5% rate was\ndetermined for an antiretroviral, and that involved a licence to settle a\ncompetition dispute. In short, any adequate rate would be likely to be way\nin excess of the derisory 0.05% stipulated by the ministry.\n\n\nFailure to Consider Individual Merits: The ministry failed to comply with\nArticle 31(a) of Trips because it did not consider each case on \"its\nindividual merits\". This is the most basic and fundamental of all of the\nministry's failures to comply.\n\n\nTo consider any case on \"its individual merits\" by definition requires\nprior consultations with the affected party. That party must be given the\nopportunity to make its case and provide relevant evidence. These\nprinciples resonate in provisions such as Article 41(3) of Trips, which\nsays: \"Decisions on the merits of the case shall be based only on evidence\nin respect of which parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.\"\n\n\nIn the case of every announcement of a CL, the ministry ignored these\nprinciples. It deliberately decided not to hold prior consultations. It\nseems the ministry had a preconceived view that any prior consultations\nwere unlikely to be productive as far as it was concerned.\n\n\nBy stipulating a blanket, uniform royalty rate of 0.05% for each product,\nthe ministry also failed to consider the individual merits of the products.\nHad it done so and given the patent holders the opportunity to present\ntheir cases, it may have realised each product and each CL is different,\nand accordingly the rates ought to have been different and more adequate.\n\n\nTrips is an international treaty to which Thailand is as signatory. Under\nthe new interim constitution, Thailand has an obligation to comply with its\nobligations under international treaties, including Trips. We will explore\nthe legal implications of this obligation in our next article.\n\n\nPeerapan Tungsuwan is a partner at Baker & McKenzie. She can be reached at\npeerapan.tungsuwan@bakernet.com.
