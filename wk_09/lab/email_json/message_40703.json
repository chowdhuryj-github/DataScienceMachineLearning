This in\nitself should not be problematic, I guess. But do I have to handle\nsources? GPL section 3 requires me to either include all sources of\nthe installed GPL binaries or give a written offer to ship the sources\non CD/DVD/whatever media. Is that correct, or is it ok to say 'look,\nit's Debian on that machine, go to debian.org for the sources'?\n\nWhat are other people who sell PCs with preinstalled Debian doing?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
