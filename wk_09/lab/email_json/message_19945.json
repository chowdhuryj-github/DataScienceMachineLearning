Kate in the car.\n\nYou and I and Rosabel believe.\n\nKate. I've been thinking about voices and thinking about thinking\nabout voices... and ...\n\nThe Dreaming. I know those songs like a baby knows the word mama. I've\nbeen singing them for approx. 23 years. I know every note and\ninflection in that album and it just comes soaring out of me. I don't\nhave to much think about it, but if I do... it's also lovely. Such\namazing thoughts set to wild expansive music.... sung...\nindescribably...\n\nKate has freed many wild ones on this earth. She has the keys to that\nportal where we can roam and prowl unmolested. Unarrested. That's why\nshe has such a loyal tribe.\n\nGet Out of My House turns me into a demon. I had to talk myself into\nenjoying the speed I was doing while driving in. I soooo wanted to\nrace through Kate's mind and that music in my car on this plane.\n\nI feel secretly, quietly sexy and alive.\n\n"}
