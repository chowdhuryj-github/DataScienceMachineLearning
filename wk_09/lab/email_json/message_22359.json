One for the\ncharacter stored and one for the colour and attribute.  The\ncolour/attribute consists of background colour and forground colour\nwith a couple of bits dedicated to blinking or high intensity and the\nlike.  So basically you mask off the info and then use that to point\nin to an array to get the text string for the colours you want to\nsay.  You do the same thing with the characters to get the\npronunciation.\n\n  Kirk\n\n-- \n\nKirk Reiser\t\t\t\tThe Computer Braille Facility\ne-mail: kirk@braille.uwo.ca\t\tUniversity of Western Ontario\nphone: (519) 661-3061\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
