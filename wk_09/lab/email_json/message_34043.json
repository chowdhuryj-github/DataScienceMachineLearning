If you're using I believe alsa 0.10\nor later with a card that isn't multi-channel, dmix is used\nautomatically, so you don't need to do anything to activate\nit. Otherwise, you can activate dmix with a $HOME/.asoundrc\nfile. You'll need to search the web to find out exactly what should go\nin that file to activate dmix, since I got rid of my $HOME/.asoundrc\nwhen alsa started supporting dmix by default on cards which need\nit. I'm by no means an expert on this, so anything I've said here\nstands to be corrected.\n\nGreg\n\n\nOn Mon, May 21, 2007 at 06:30:44PM -0700, Zachary Kline wrote:\n> Hello,\n>     I am dealing with a fairly annoying problem--one which seems quite complex.  How do I achieve software mixing with Alsa?  (I want to be able to play an MP3 stream and also have software speech going.)
