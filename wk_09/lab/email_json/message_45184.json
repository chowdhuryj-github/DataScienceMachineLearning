The\n*recipient* of the work is the one who should be deciding what changes\nare appropriate for a free work; the licensor *cannot* pretend to\ncover all possibilities by any means other than an unqualified \"you\nmay make any changes to the work\".\n\nAny work with modification restrictions narrower than that is not a\nfree work.\n\n-- \n \\           \"A poet more than thirty years old is simply an overgrown |\n  `\\                                      child.\"  -- Henry L.
