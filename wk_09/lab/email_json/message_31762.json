While I am quite confident that data\nare ready, I receive errors on prelim.mix() step.\n\nMy dataset is actually a data matrix with 365 obs and 11 vars. 10 vars\nare qualitative (ex-factor recoded as requested in ?prelim.mix) and\nordered as needed in the first columns. NA status is good with no more\nthan 1% per var.\n\nThis is the output i receive when I run prelim.mix(mydata,10)\n\nSteps of EM: \n1...2...3...Errore: NA/NaN/Inf in chiamata a funzione esterna (arg 6)\n\nSince the message is not so helpfull, could someone help me to debug?\nLike stlouis dataset, mine is a matrix and missing values are NA.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
