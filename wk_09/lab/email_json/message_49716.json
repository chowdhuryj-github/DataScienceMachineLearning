It is\nonly thanks to Speakup being included in the default kernel that we are able\nto perform unassisted installations of Gentoo at all.  This seems as if it\nwould be a great step backwards.\n    Might I suggest that we attempt to contact the Speakup mailing list and\ndevelopers for information on this issue?\nThank you,\nZachary Kline.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"William Hubbs\" \nTo: \nSent: Sunday, June 17, 2007 1:00 PM\nSubject: gentoo dropping speakup support\n\n\n> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> Hash: SHA1\n>\n> All,\n>\n> because of this bug [1], gentoo linux will be dropping support for speakup\n\n> in its official kernels starting at 2.6.22.\n>\n> [1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177794\n>\n> Is there any possibility at all that speakup could be moved into user \n> space as the bug suggests?
