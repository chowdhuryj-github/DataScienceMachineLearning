I run a bash script that collects\ndata into many CSV files and have been processing them one at a time on my\nlocal machine with an excel macro.  I would like to use R to take data\npoints from each of the CSV files and create line graphs in PDF format\nbecause it will save me ALOT of time.  I am able to successfully do this\nwhen I call the file name directly...however my script bombs when I try to\ndo multiple files.  I would like the created pdf's to have the same filename\nas the original csv files.  I have looked quite a bit and not found much\nhelp on \"batch processing\" an entire directory.  My current code is as\nfollows:\n\nlist <- dir(\"/tmp/data\")\nfor(x in list){\nd <- read.table(x, sep=\"\\t\", header=TRUE) # read data\npdf(\"/tmp/graph/x.pdf\")                              # file for graph\nplot(d$BlockSeqNum, d$MBs,                              # Blocks as x, MB/s\nas y     \n     type=\"l\",                                     # plot lines, not points\n     xlab=\"Blocks\",                                  # label x axis\n     ylab=\"MB/s\",                                  # label y axis\n     main=x)          # add title\ndev.off()                                          # close file\nq()                                                # quit\n\nERROR: Error in plot.window(xlim, ylim, log, asp, ...) :\n        need finite 'xlim' values\nIn addition: Warning messages:\n1: no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n2: no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\n3: no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n4: no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\nExecution halted\n\nThank you for your wisdom!\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Using-R-to-create-pdf%27s-from-each-file-in-a-directory-tf3621434.html#a10112832\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
