In  the raw data frame is subject,  \nstimulus_presence, and response information.  I aggregate this into a  \ntable now currently by separating out the target_presence=true data  \nand working out a hit rate and then workout out the false alarm rate  \nfrom the target_presence=false data.  Then I cbind the \"x\" column  \nfrom the false alarm aggregate to the hit rate data.  Then I can also  \nappend a dprime column if I wish.  I am just inquiring as to whether  \nthere is some facility I am missing for aggregating the variables  \nsimultaneously or just generating the d' in one step.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
