It's human nature to assume that a company that makes a great\nproduct will be a good investment, but that's often not the case.  So\nlet's kick it off with Apple.\n\nMy first encounter with Apple came back in 1986 - 21 years ago! - when I\njoined Cabot and we were looking to replace the old paper-based subscriber\ntracking system with an electronic database.   The best system I could\nfind, MacSub, was designed to run on a Macintosh computer, so I bought a\nMac.  And before long, we were using Microsoft Word to write on it,\nfinding it more user-friendly than the old green-screen IBM\nDisplaywriter.\n\nThen came Microsoft Excel, for spreadsheets, and Adobe PageMaker for\nlayout.  And before you know it, Macs were all over the office.\n\nOver the years I attended most MacWorld shows in Boston, most MacWorlds in\nNew York, saw two keynote speeches by Steve Jobs, the master of the\nreality distortion field (It was said that simple proximity to the man\ncould alter your thought waves), and attended the final few MacWorld shows\nin Boston.\n\nFor the home, I bought Macs because I knew them from the office.  The kids\nused them to write and illustrate school papers, and to play games, never\nminding that there were more games for Windows machines.  And then came\nthe Internet, which changed everything.\n\nIn January 2001, Apple introduced iTunes.  I confess I had no idea where\niTunes would lead, but iTunes alone compelled me to spend many months\ncopying all the \"good\" songs from my CD collection into iTunes.\n\nWhen the iPod came out that October, my wife bought one, and I copied all\nmy music onto it.  Today everyone in the family has an iPod.   \n2001 also marked the opening of the first Apple Store, which proved a\nfantastic marketing decision, as it enabled people to try the machines in\na no-pressure situation, and get help from the friendly people at the\nGenius Bar.\n\nFinally, in April 2003, Apple opened the iTunes store, providing the start\nof the solution to illegal downloading of audio and video.  My first\npurchases were a dozen recordings of Stardust, the Hoagy Carmichael tune,\nby various artists, and I burned them all to one CD so I could listen to\nthem in the car.  To date, I've bought over 860 items - some TV shows and\nshort films but mostly songs - through the iTunes Store.\n\nAs a consumer, at both work and home I've benefited from Apple's products\nimmensely.  A world without Apple's products would be poorer indeed.  But\nas an investor, I've seen the ups and downs of Apple's stock.  Oh, we've\nhad our share of successes with Apple; most recently the Cabot Market\nLetter advised buying in September 2004, and sold ten months later for a\nprofit of 112%.  But overall, Apple has not been an easy stock to make\nmoney in.\n\nFor example, Apple came public in December 1980 at $5, and that's where it\nwas in December 1997, seventeen years later.  Over the years, the stock\nhas suffered losses of 73%, 83%, and 83%.  And more recently, the stock\nperformed no better than the market from the start of 1995 to the start of\n2005.\n\nOn the other hand, it's brought advances of 990%, 1000% and - over the\npast four years, 1,400%.  Stupendous!\n\nHistorically, the best way to invest in Apple has been to buy when both\nthe company and the stock market have been out of favor, and to sell when\nboth are in favor.  Today, however, there's a lot of love for Apple in the\nworld.  The company reported super first quarter results just last week;\nrevenues grew 21% (the slowest growth in 3 1/2 years) but earnings shot up\n85% (the best gain in six quarters). Thanks to after-tax profit margins\nthat hit 14.6%, the best yet!\n\nThe stock gapped higher on the news, touching $100 for the first time, and\nnow we'll see if the stock can build on that.  Simple technical analysis\nsays it's likely.  On the other hand, sentiment is high, and I note that\nsince January 2006, Apple has only equaled the market's performance, and\nthus this presents the possibility of a long RP (relative performance)\ntop.\n\nBottom line: color me a true-blue fan of the company's products but not a\nbig fan of the stock today.  In short, there are better-looking charts to\nown in today's market.\n\n\n----- ADVERTISEMENT -----\n\nGrow 50% or Pay Nothing!\n\nWhen Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall Street\nin August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month. Since then it's\nhanded investors 600% gains.\n\nWhen we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was shooting\nthrough the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month. It was\nselling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a 2-for-1\nsplit) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.\n\nWhen the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were behind in\nJuly 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months after we\nnamed it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an incredible\n$160 a share.\n\nThere are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us an\n88% average profit per stock over the past two years...\n\nIntroducing Cabot Stock of the Month - Try It Risk Free for the Next 12\nMonths...\n\nTo learn more, please visit this link:\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/169592/13148861/86/0/\n\n-----\n\n\nNow on to a product that's far less well-known, and that, to date, has\noffered no investment opportunity.  It's ReplayTV.  Call it the\nalternative to TiVo that many people have never heard of.\n\nBoth TiVo and ReplayTV began selling their digital video recorder (DVR)\nproducts in late 1999.  The promise?  Like a VCR, they would enable you to\n\"time-shift,\" to watch a recorded TV show whenever you wanted.  But\nbecause they were based on hard drive technology, random access meant\nthere was no need to wind or rewind.   And storage capacity was enormous.\n\nI bought a ReplayTV instead of a TiVo, in part because of the look and\nfeel of the interface, and in part because of ReplayTV's commercial-skip\nfeature.  Once a show was recorded you could automatically skip over the\ncommercials; with TiVo you could only fast-forward through the\ncommercials.\n\nSince then, I only watch TV commercials during the Super Bowl . . . and\nwhen I'm outside my own house . . . and I can't tell you how annoying\nthose commercials are when you're accustomed to not seeing them!\n\nAn investment in ReplayTV was almost possible, but it's a good thing it\nwasn't.  TiVo went public in September 1999, peaked at 79 in January 2000,\nand has never been even close to that level since.   \nThis year it's climbed from 5 to 6 1/2.  And TiVo has never had a\nprofitable year, despite the fact that was always better-marketed and\nbetter-recognized than ReplayTV.  The problem?  Not enough buyers of a\ntechnology that was just a little too complicated for most people.\n\nReplayTV planned to go public in March 2000, but a weak market for IPOs\n(not to mention a big bad bear market) got in the way.  The IPO was\neventually withdrawn in August 2000.  And then the company was sued by\ndozens of TV networks and studios over the commercial-skipping feature.\n\nNearing bankruptcy, ReplayTV was bought by SonicBlue in 2001.  Then in\n2003(still fighting the lawsuits), SonicBlue filed for bankruptcy and was\nsold to D&M Holdings, a Japanese company that includes Denon, Marantz,\nMcIntosh, Snell, Boston Acoustics, and Escient brands.   \n\nToday D&M sells ReplayTV for the PC, software that puts the functions of a\nVCR in your computer.\n\nDVRs, meanwhile, are now available from your local cable provider.   \nThey're made by Motorola, Scientific Atlanta, and other major\nmanufacturers.  But they don't skip commercials.  (If you're a real geek,\nhowever, you can find instructions online for hacking your TiVo so it\nskips commercials, and I assume it's possible with other units as well.)\n\nEventually, my ReplayTV will die - all hard drives do - but I'm in no\nhurry for that day to come.  In fact, when it comes, I may just replace\nthe hard drive!  Because I've arrived at the best part of the story.  When\nI originally bought my ReplayTV, I had a choice of payment plans - pay a\nmonthly fee or a one-time lifetime fee.\n\nI paid the lifetime fee - I believe it was $250 - and haven't paid a penny\nsince.  Over 7 1/2 years, that's just $33 a year . . . and falling.  And\nthe machine still works, dialing faithfully into the network now\nmaintained by D&M Holdings.  In the end, the machine has proved a far\nbetter investment than the stock would have been.\n\n-----\n\nThe third company that's changed my life is XM Satellite Radio, the\ncompany that offers pay-for-service radio, with 73 different music\nchannels, 39 channels of news, talk, sports and entertainment, 21 regional\ntraffic channels and 23 play-by-play sports channels.\n\nThe other company in the industry is Sirius, which offers a similar full\nslate of programming.  XM's service was launched in September 2001, while\nSirius started in July 2002.  I think both are wonderful.\n\nI became a subscriber of XM somewhere in 2002, when a radio came out that\nfit my car aesthetically.  And since then, I don't listen to commercials\nor other blather in my car. Instead, I listen to a wide variety of music. \nWhen I hear a new song I like, I push a button that records the name of\nthe artist and song and from time to time I go to the iTunes store and buy\nthose songs.  Life is good.\n\nBut as an investment, neither XM nor Sirius has brought riches to its\ninvestors, and the simple reason is that both companies have spent too\nmuch money.\n\nThey've got plenty of customers.  At the end of 2006, Sirius had 6 million\npaying subscribers, while XM had 7.6 million.  And revenues?   \nXM brought in $933 million last year, while Sirius brought in $637.   \nBut neither company has ever turned a profit!  And now they want to merge\n- which raises issues of a possible monopoly - but that's a subject for\nanother day.\n\nSo could you have made money in XM?  Actually, we did.  The Cabot Market\nLetter recommended XM in March 2003, at the start of a great bull market\nand sold thirteen months later for a profit of 388%.\n\nThe stock also appeared in Cabot Top Ten in July, November and December of\n2003, and buying at any one of those dates could have worked out very\nwell, but XM was not a stock to buy and hold and neither was Sirius.  Like\nmost companies that have trouble turning revenues into profit, the stocks\nbegan lagging badly.  This year, for example, XM began the year at 15 and\nis now 12.  Sirius began the year at 3 1/2 and is now at 3.\n\nBottom line: It takes more than good products to make a good investment. \nIt helps if management can convert revenues into earnings!  But even if\nthey can't you can still find profitable investment opportunities in\nstocks that change people's lives; just don't get stuck holding the stocks\ntoo long!\n\n-----\n\nEditor's Note\n\nThe best growth companies tend to find their way into the pages of Cabot\nMarket Letter, and when their products are as life-changing as those\ndescribed above, you'll hear about it from us.

This morning at 7:15 a truck hit a utility pole in our\nneighborhood, knocking out power to a portion of the city for 3 1/4 hours.\n So we got off to a slow start in the office today.  But we feel lucky\ncompared to those folks in California who lost their freeway!\n\nYours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,\n\nTimothy Lutts\nPublisher\nCabot Wealth Advisory\n\n-----\n\nCabot Wealth Advisory, a free thrice-weekly e-mail service brought to you\nby the Cabot family of investment newsletters.
