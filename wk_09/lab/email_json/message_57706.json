Can I compile a module on one box and \n> somehow install the code on another?\n> Might this be as simple as copying over the contents of the \n> directories in @INC?\n\nAs it turns out, this was fairly easy to do.\n\nI followed the advice from Chas Owens who suggested that I build them\nmanually on another box and stop before the \"make install\".\nThere were no pre-reqs that needed to be installed, so I guess I got\nlucky there.\n\nI tar'd up the build directories, moved them over, did another \"make\ntest\" just to feel good about it, then the \n\"make install\". Further tests with our code went well.\n\nThanks Chas, and to all who responded!\n\nrichf\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n\n"}
