It is pretty straight forward to convert an existing perl script into a stand alone windows executable.  \n \nBoth the Activestate licence and the Perl Artistic licence allow for embedding a script and perl interpreter together and distributing the result.\n \nThe current perl script(s) used for the R package build package could easily be converted to a 'stand alone' windows executable and be distributed with Rtools for those who do not want to install Perl themselves.\n \nThe only drawback is that even a \"Hello World\" script will result in over a meg sized executable (due to the perl interpreter being included).\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch on behalf of Gabor Grothendieck\nSent: Fri 5/4/2007 11:55 AM\nTo: Doran, Harold\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch; Duncan Murdoch\nSubject: Re: [R] [SPAM] - Re: R package development in windows - BayesianFilter detected spam\n\n\n\nJust googling I found this:\n\nhttp://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=186402\n\nOn 5/4/07, Doran, Harold  wrote:\n>\n> > The best, of course, would be to get rid of Perl altogether.\n>\n> In Python, it is possible to make standalone executables.
