I\ncan't train the model every time when I do prediction. So I need to save the\ntrained model onto disk after the first training. Does anybody have idea\nabout this? You help is highly appreciated. \n\n \n\nBest Regards\n\n \n\nFeng\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
