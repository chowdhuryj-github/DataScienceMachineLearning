But I\ndo want to agree publicly that there's no clash between brian and\nmyself. I have only the highest respect for brian: as a person, as an\neducator, and as an expert on Perl. I respect his opinion (even\nwhen--as now--I strongly disagree with it) and I respect his right to\nhold and express that opinion.\n\nIt was a mistake to publicly express my private dismay. I apologize to\nanyone who was hurt or upset by my having done so.\n\nDamian\n\n"}
