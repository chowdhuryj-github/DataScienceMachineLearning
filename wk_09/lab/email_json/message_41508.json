Only you are talking about 'doubled \nvalues': the error report is about 'zero or negative distance'\n\nWhat the help page says is\n\n        d: distance structure of the form returned by 'dist', or a full,\n           symmetric matrix.  Data are assumed to be dissimilarities or\n           relative distances, but must be positive except for\n           self-distance.  Both missing and infinite values are allowed.\n\nand you are not supplying such a structure.\n\nIn any case, you seem to be trying to do isoMDS on Euclidean distances \nfrom a 1D array.  There is no point in doing any form of MDS on Euclidean \ndistances unless dimension reduction is involved, since otherwise the \ndistances can be represented exactly.\n\nI suggest you take some statistical advice on your problem, as your issues \ndo not seem to be with R.\n\n\nOn Sun, 3 Jun 2007, Thomas Zastrow wrote:\n\n> Thank you very much for your answer.\n>\n> Isn't it possible to tell the isoMDS function that it should ignore doubled \n> values with the same value?
