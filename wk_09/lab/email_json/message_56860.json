So please kindly be patient with me.\nI'm trying to arrange groups of levelplots into 3 rows as follows:\n\nRow1: Probabilities as functions of x and y, and conditioned on an event factor vector factor(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")\n\nRow2: Number of days as functions of  x and y, and conditioned on, again the same event factor(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")\n\nRow2: Costs as functions of  x and y, and conditioned on, again the same event factor(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")\n\nI tried the following:\n\nwindows();\npar(mfrow=c(3,1));\nlevelplot(z ~ x*y|events, probDat);\nlevelplot(z ~ x*y|events, daysDat);\nlevelplot(z ~ x*y|events, costDat);\n\nIt does not do what I want. It replace the previous plot every time I call a new levelplot. I can't put them into the same matrix and plot them all at once because the scale of each data type is very different, i.e.g probability=c(0,1), days=c(0,10), etc. I'm wondering if you could suggest a way to solve this problem.\n\nAlso, if I would like to put in mathematical notation on the top strip of the plot instead of using text in my events factor vector, what can I do? \n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n- adschai\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
