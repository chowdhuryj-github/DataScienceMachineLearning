Never.  The only time unless should ever be used is in postfix\nnotation, as in:\n\ndie \"No arguments passed in!\" unless @_;\n\nOtherwise, unless is bulky, a waste of space, confusing to new Perl\nprogrammers, and unscalable.  (As soon as you add an 'else' clause,\npeople have to read it two or three times to understand what's being\ndone).  Avoid at all costs.\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
