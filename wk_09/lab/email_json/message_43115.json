This sounds like a spatial\nstatistics problem but the available tools all seem focused on 2+\ndimensional data.  Time series methods have the right dimensionality\nbut seem focused on regularly spaced data.\n\nDoes anyone know of an R package that implements spatial statistics\nmethods for one-dimensional data?  So far I've come up pretty dry.\n\n-- Dave\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
