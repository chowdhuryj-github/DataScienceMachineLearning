Enter\n\n  ?sample\n\nfor more information. In the above case\n\n  sample((0:42), 15, replace=TRUE)\n\nwill do what you seem to describe above. Example:\n\n> sample((0:42), 15, replace=TRUE)\n [1] 26 38  1 41 11 30 22 37 28  0  0 25 10 39 27\n\nif you want them in random order (i.e. \"as they come off the line\"),\nor\n\n> sort(sample((0:42), 15, replace=TRUE))\n [1]  1  3  5  8  8 10 16 17 21 25 30 30 33 34 40\n\nif you want them sorted.\n\nBest wishes,\nTed.\n\n> I have read the R-help archives and the statistics and computing\n> book on modern Applied statistics with S but the advice seems to\n> be for much form complicated examples, there must be a simpler way\n> for what I am trying to do?\n> \n> If anybody can help me I would greatly appreciate your advice and time,\n> \n> Best Wishes,\n> \n> Jenny\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE-Mail: (Ted Harding) \nFax-to-email: +44 (0)870 094 0861\nDate: 06-Jun-07                                       Time: 16:24:15\n------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
