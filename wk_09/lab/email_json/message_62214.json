I need to process the file when it is completely written\nto. I do not initially know how big the file will be in the end.\nFurther, the application does NOT put a write lock on the file while\nit is writing it. because of the buffering, the program wirtes to the\nfile in random chunks not continuously. And what is worse, the file\nformat itself could vary so there is nothing in the actual file that\nsignals the end of it. Everything is on a linux server.\n\nWhat's the most efficient way of checking this? - one way is perhaps\ninifinite loop checking mmtime until it is stable for a certain amount\nof time?? I am not sure.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\n\nKyle\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
