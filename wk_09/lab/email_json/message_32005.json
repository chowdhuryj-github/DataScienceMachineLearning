'Firefox's\npage-cache mechanism, for example, introduced in version 1.5, stores the\nlast eight visited pages in the computer's memory. Caching pages in\nmemory allows faster back browsing, but it can also leave a lot less\nmemory for other applications to use. Less available RAM equals a\nless-responsive computer.

'One of the first issues to note is that you may\nnot see an actual one terabyte capacity on your system. First, the\nformatted capacity is always less than the raw space available on the\ndrive.

One megabyte of hard drive space is\n1,000,000 bytes: 10^6 bytes. Operating systems calculate one megabyte as\n2^20 bytes, or 1,048,576 bytes.
