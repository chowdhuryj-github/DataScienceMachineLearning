GLAESER\nA road map for environmentalism\n\nBy Edward L. Glaeser  |  May 21, 2007\n\nWE ARE ALL environmentalists now. The growing threat posed by global\nwarming makes it impossible to ignore the environmental impacts of\nour actions. No presidential candidate in 2008 will be able to act as\nif climate change is a loony leftist cause best fought with\naggressive development of the Arctic.\n\nBut environmentalists should celebrate their much-deserved success\nwith an increasing commitment to responsible policies that target\nclimate change and weigh costs against benefits. In the early days of\nenvironmentalism, almost any action could be justified as a means of\nincreasing environmental awareness. Now we are all aware and\ncommitted to the environment, and it is time to turn to policies that\nare both green and smart.\n\nSmart environmentalism has three key elements. First, policies should\nbe targeted toward the biggest environmental threat: global warming.\nSecond, our resources and political capital are limited. This means\nwe must weigh the benefits of each intervention against its costs.\nThird, we must anticipate unintended consequences, where being green\nin one place leads to decidedly non green outcomes someplace else.\n\nThese simple rules provide a policy road map for environmentalism.\nThe fight against climate change requires us to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. The most effective way to reduce emissions is to charge\npeople for the social costs of their actions with a carbon tax. A\nsignificant carbon tax would be painful -- gas will cost more at the\npump -- but it is never easy to change behavior, and change behavior\nwe must.\n\nThe big challenge in reducing greenhouse gases is to reduce the\ngrowth of emissions in rapidly developing economies like China and\nIndia. I suspect this will require Europe and the United States to\ncreate incentives for these places to reduce emissions. One possible\ncourse of action is for American and European carbon taxes to provide\nfunding that could be used to reward poorer countries for cutting\nemissions.\n\nNew technologies are likely to be our best weapons against climate\nchange and we should try to encourage more energy-efficient\ninnovation. Our patent system is poorly suited to encourage these\ninnovations, since successful innovations will create environmental\nsocial benefits that far exceed the private revenues earned by the\ninnovator. Patents also make it less likely that technology will be\ntransferred to the developing world. A better system might be to\noffer large public prizes that reward innovations, which are then\nmade freely available throughout the globe.\n\nBut smart environmentalism doesn't just mean more government\nprograms, it also means rethinking current policies. Our emissions\npolicy, which requires regular emissions tests for newer vehicles, is\nexpensive to operate and poorly designed to fight climate change.\nAfter all, it does nothing to induce less driving. Even more\nproblematically, by letting owners of older cars off the hook, the\ncurrent system imposes costs on the Prius driver but exempts the\ndrivers of the vintage gas guzzlers that create the most emissions.\nWe should require different emissions tests and even higher emission\ntaxes for older cars that generate higher environmental costs.\n\nOur paper recycling programs cost time and money and do little to\nprotect first-growth woodlands and rain forests. The trees used by\npaper mills are a renewable resource. When people use more paper,\nsuppliers plant more trees. If we want bigger commercial forests,\nthen we should use more paper not less. Our policies should directly\nprotect important wildlife habitats, not try to reduce our demand for\npaper.\n\nPerhaps the most environmentally problematic local policies are land-\nuse controls. The foes of development correctly point out that new\ndevelopment will use energy and land, but the right calculation also\nconsiders the costs created by stopping development and pushing it\nelsewhere. When we stop development in Boston's inner-ring suburbs,\nwe shift development to areas with fewer people that might oppose new\ndevelopment. The move from higher- to lower-density development\nensures more driving and energy use. Protecting green space in the\ninner suburbs is a form of environmentalism, but it is an\nenvironmentalism that creates local benefits by imposing costs on the\nrest of the world, since it pushes development into the highway-crazy\nexurbs.\n\nThe state should take the lead by requiring environmental impact\nreviews to compare the environmental costs of allowing a project with\nthe expected environmental consequences if a rejected project is\nbuilt elsewhere.\n\nClimate change is too important for us not to consider all of the\nconsequences of our policies. We should rethink policies that appear\nenvironmental but that actually ensure more driving and greenhouse\ngases.\n\nEdward L.
