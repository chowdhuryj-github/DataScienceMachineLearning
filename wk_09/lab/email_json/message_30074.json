I also realize that the \nGPL does not preclude \"commercial\" == \"for profit\" usage. I was merely \nechoing the terminology used by Trolltech. I do not condone it however.\n\nThanks as always for all your feedback.\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
