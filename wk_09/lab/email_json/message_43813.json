As an example, suppose you want a sample size for a two group difference in normal means but you get your estimate of your variance from a previous study. Then with this package, you can account for the variability of that variance estimate in your sample size calculations. The details are described in:\n\n\n\n\t\tFay, MP, Halloran, ME, Follmann, DA. Accounting for Variability in Sample Size Estimation with Applications to Nonadherence and Estimation of Variance and Effect Size. Biometrics 2007, 63: 465-474. http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00703.x\n\n\nPlease let me know of any problems with the package or have any comments.\n\nThanks, \n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n******************************************************************\nMichael P.
