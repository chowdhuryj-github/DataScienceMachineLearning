There's not much of a point of spending time on 1555 or\n4444 on the GX right now.  If somebody wants to do some testing on 1555,\nthat would be fine.  Since there are already lots of developer machines\nout there, and that's all that people have to work with, it would\nprobably be helpful to spend some time and get hard Xlib performance\nnumbers and oprofiles of some of the cases to make sure 1555 is better.\n\nAgain, Xlib's and cairo's pixman library has no MMX optimization for\n1555, and therefore X11 pixmap conversions from anything to 1555 will\nhurt more than anything to 565.  I guess that's not a problem for\nSqueak, but it's a problem for everyone else.  We just need some\nnumbers.\n\nDan\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
