At the same time, the\nreceiver should be able to play the video script.Yet, I don't know how\nto get Perl to do it?  Which types of modules I may need? Should I use\nTCP/IP modules or something else? Surely not HTTP or FTP, right? Which\nkeywords should I use to search in CPAN to find appropriate modules?\nThanks!\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
