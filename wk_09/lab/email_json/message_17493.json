But\nunfortunately, I am not completely and utterly stuck. Here's the\nproblem:\n\nI have two large, six dimensional arrays that I would like to add\ntogether. Lets call them f and m. Their dimensions are respectively:\n\n> dim(f)\n[1] 10  25  1  1  1 14\n> dim(m)\n[1] 10 1 1 1 1 14\n\nYou can see that they're pretty close in size, but not identical. What I\nwould like to do is expand or inflate m along its second dimension so\nthat it ends up with dimension 10 25 1 1 1 14, so that I can then add\nthe two together - the new values created along that second dimension\nwould simply be copies of the first value..\n\nWhat's the fastest way to do this? Is there a dedicated function?\nIdeally I envisage something that you feed the input array, and the\ndesired dimensions, and it does the rest for you. Please also bear in\nmind that this is a specific problem - the more general case is where I\ndon't know which dimensions are \"out of shape\", so to speak...\n\nI hope that's clear, and that someone can me out here...\n\nCheers,\n\nMark\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
