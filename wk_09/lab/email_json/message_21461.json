However,\nplease could you clarify whether my degrees of freedom are\nappropriate?\n\nI had 106 subjects,\neach of them was observed about 9 times, creating 882 data points.\nThe subjects were in 3 treatment groups, so I have told the model to\ninclude subject as a random factor nested within treatment.\nThere are two other variables and I'm interested in their two-way\ninteractions with Treatment.\nI'm happy with the model structure, and the output generally looks right, but...\n\nIn the 'DF' column of the output table, it has 882 as the degrees of\nfreedom for all the variables (except Treatment itself, which has 0\ndegrees of freedom). At the bottom of the output, it says Groups:\nSubjects = 106, Treatment = 3.\n\nShould I be worried or is this what to expect?!\n\nI was expecting it to be more like an ANOVA table, where the error\ndegrees of freedom should reflect the number of subjects, not all the\ndata points.\n\nI can't see the usual differentiation between the numerater and\ndenominator/error degrees of freedom, so am I right in thinking the DF\ncolumn shows the error degrees of freedom? Or do glmms not work like\nthis?\n\nThank you very much in advance,\nCharlotte\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
