I would like to introduce the plot of my\ngroupedData object in my latex report using Sweave but it doesn't work. \nI have no error message in R (Sweave(my.file_Rnw)) and the plot is\ngenerated in R, but when I want to see the pdf (I'm using TexnicCenter) of\nmy report, there is an error message and no pdf file is generated. It seems\nthat the plot generated by plot.nmGroupedData is not found by TexnicCenter.\nDoes anyone have an idea on how to solve this problem?\nThank you,\nCaroline\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
