See the appendix \"Invoking R\" of the Introduction manual \nfor the current command line parameters, which don't include \"open a \nscript\".  This would be a reasonable addition, and I'll add it at some \npoint, sooner if someone else comes up with a convincing argument for \nthe \"right\" command line parameter to do this.\n\nIt would be better if clicking on a second script opened a new window in \nthe same session, but that takes more work; not sure I'll get to this.\n\nDuncan Murdoch\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
