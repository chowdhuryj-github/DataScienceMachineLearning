I have both a doubletalk and a tripletalk. But lately, \nI've been using the doubletalk more than the  tripletalk. The tripletalk \ndoesn't seem to work with the latest speakup-enabled version of the debian \ninstaller. The triple talk has some advantages over the doubletalk though. \nIt  gets power through the USB port so you don't have to plug it into a wall \nsocket. The doubletalk can use a battery but i would always forget to turn \nit off and the next thing I knew, the battery would be dead.\n\nThe tripletalk is also a little bit more solidly built. I had to send my \ndoubletalk back to have the serial cable replaced. And now the headphone \njack broke. It's true that the doubletalk has taken a beating the way i \ncarry it around. I am always grabbing it and running up to somebody's office \nto fix their computer. But I do the same thing with the tripletalk and it \nstill works.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
