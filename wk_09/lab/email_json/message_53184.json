Explore the likelihood of seg\nfaults while running the test.  Check latest reports of Parrot\nconfiguration tools testing coverage to see where your time available\nfor writing tests is spent.\"\n\nReports of the extent to which tests in the 'reconfigure' \nbranch's t/configure/ directory cover the code in \nconfig/*/*.pm packages may be found here:  \nhttp://thenceforward.net/parrot/coverage/configure-build/coverage.html\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nkid51\n\n"}
