As a result world grain reserves have dwindled to \n                  57 days. This is the lowest level of grain reserves in 34 years.\nWhile \n                  the UN lists 34 countries as needing food aid, 30% of next year's \n                  grain harvest in the U.S. will be converted to ethanol to fuel \n                  cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nQUOTE \n                OF THE WEEK:\n                \"The stage is now set for direct competition for grain between \n                the 800 million people who own automobiles, and the world's 2 \n                billion poorest people.\"\nLester \n                Brown from the Earth Policy Institute speaking at a briefing to \n                the US Senate two weeks ago. \n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                image parody\n\n\nSOLUTION \n                OF THE WEEK:\n                FEED THE HUNGRY AT THE GAS PUMP\n\nAutomakers \n                  roughly doubled the fuel economy of cars between the 1970s and \n                  the late 1980s. In other words, the \"know-how\" \n                  has been here for a long time.\nOver \n                  the past 20 years, automakers have used advancements in technology \n                  to add more than 800 pounds to the average vehicle and nearly \n                  double horsepower, while fuel economy has declined. Be smart \n                  about what you drive.\nThe \n                  grain required to fill a 25 gallon gas tank with ethanol would \n                  feed one person for a year. Every time you fill your tank, think \n                  about biking, walking, mass transit or just relaxing at home. \n                  Live simply so that others may live. \nNext \n                  year, 30% of U.S. corn will be used for ethanol. Instead, the \n                  same amount of fuel could be saved by increasing average fuel \n                  efficiency by just three miles per gallon. Let your Representatives \n                  and Senators \n                  know that you support strong fuel efficiency standards and a \n                  wholesale conversion of U.S. transportation, utilities, and \n                  agriculture to renewable sources of energy..Take part in OCA's \n                  Farm Bill alert below.\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________\n\n\n\n\n\nimage \n                parody\n\n\nALERT:THE \n                2007 FARM BILL\n                SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE OR CORPORATE WELFARE\n                Congress is currently drafting a new Farm Bill, legislation that \n                will determine agriculture policy for the next five years. Will \n                it be more corporate welfare for polluting agribusiness or new \n                incentives for farmers to provide healthy and affordable food \n                while protecting farmworkers and the environment? Unfortunately, \n                the bill that the House Agriculture Committee is working on is \n                looking a lot more like the former. \nPlease write Congress in support of sustainable \n                agriculture: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5813.cfm\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nimage \n                parody\n\n\nNAIS \n                ALERT:\n                KEEP 'BIG BROTHER' OUT OF FARM BILL\n                Industrial agriculture lobbyists have been pushing for a National \n                Animal Identification System (NAIS) for several years. The proposed \n                NAIS program would require every person who owns a farm animal, \n                even if it's just one chicken or a pet horse, to register their \n                \"property\" with the federal government, identify each \n                animal (in most cases with implanted microchips or other electronic \n                identification), and report their movements on a national database. \n                This program would impose particularly heavy burdens on family \n                farmers who raise animals on pasture, while giving further competitive \n                advantage to factory farms. The House Committee on Agriculture \n                is considering a provision in the massive 2007 Farm Bill that \n                would implement NAIS. The House Committee on Agriculture will \n                vote on the bill July 12, so time is of the essence. \nLearn more and take action: http://www.organicconsumers.org/rd/nais.cfm\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________\n\n\n\n\nNONE \n                OF THIS WORK WOULD BE POSSIBLE \n                WITHOUT YOUR DONATIONS\n                We need your support today to help us continue our work to safeguard \n                organic standards and to promote fair trade, health, and sustainability. \n                Please donate now.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.organicconsumers.org/donations.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nWEB \n                VIDEO OF THE WEEK: \n                SOIL IS ONE SECRET SOLUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING\n                Can organic farming fight climate change? Yes. And we're not just \n                talking about food miles. Research from the Rodale Institute shows \n                that sustainably-farmed soil absorbs 30% more carbon than conventional \n                agriculture, and switching our farmland to organic would cut greenhouse \n                emissions by 10% in the US (20% in Canada and most of the rest \n                of the world). For a concise explanation of how organic farming \n                could be a major tool in the fight against climate change check \n                out the 10 minute online video \"SOIL: The Secret Solution \n                to Global Warming,\" featuring Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. \n                The website includes an online petition calling on world leaders \n                to switch subsidies from conventional to sustainable farming practices.\nLearn more and watch: http://www.quantumshift.tv/v/1181028043/\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________\n\n\n\n\nWEB \n              FORUM:\n              YOUR ONLINE ORGANIC COMMUNITY HAS ARRIVED\n              Thanks to hundreds of you who responded to our invitation to join \n              OCA's new web forum.
