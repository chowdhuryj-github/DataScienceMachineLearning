I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty.\n\nThe moment the slave resolves that he will no longer be a slave. His fetters fall... freedom and slavery are mental states.\n\nFree people, remember this maxim: We may acquire liberty, but it is never recovered if it is once lost.\n\nWe must stop talking about the American dream and start listening to the dreams of the Americans.\n\nGod will not look you over for medal, degrees or diplomas, but for scars.\n\nWhere we cannot invent, we may at least improve.\n\nWe need not fear life, because God is the Ruler of all and we need not fear death, because He shares immortality with us.\n\nCaution is a most valuable asset in fishing, especially if you are the fish.\n\nRather go to bed with out dinner than to rise in debt.\n\nNo man is free who is not a master of himself.\n\nSome cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go.\n\nGive me a one-handed economist! All my economics say, ''On the one hand\u2026 on the other.''\n\nA structure becomes architectural, and not sculptural, when its elements no longer have their justification in nature.\n\n\n"}
