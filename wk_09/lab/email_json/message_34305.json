What character\nencoding should be used?\n\nIMHO \"(c)\" is the character representation of the copyright symbol,\nand when you print it, you should substitute with the correct symbol,\nas the \"ff\", \"ffl\", \"fl\", .. ligatures.\n\nAnyway when the symbol is not printed, it should be written in some\nother form (a sequence of bits, which are not law defined), so\nIMHO any \"obvious\" representation should be valid.\n\nIANAL\n\nciao\n\tcate\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
