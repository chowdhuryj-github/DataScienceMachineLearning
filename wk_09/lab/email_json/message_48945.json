Make sure package:grDevices is on that\nlist.\n\nI ran into that problem myself.  I never figured out how come it used\nto be there, but suddenly ceased to be.  The problem didn't appear\nuntil R-2.5.0.  In the USER-VISIBLE CHANGES under \nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0,\nI see this:\n\n    o\tPackage 'graphics' has been split into 'grDevices' (the graphics\n\tdevices shared between base and grid graphics) and 'graphics'\n\t(base graphics).  Each of the 'graphics' and 'grid' packages\n\tload 'grDevices' when they are attached.  Note that\n\tps.options() has been moved to grDevices and user hooks may\n\tneed to be updated.\n\nMy suspicion is that grDevices did not have to be specifically loaded\nif graphics was one of your default packages loaded at startup.  Since\nfew others seem to have had the same experience, I'd hesitate to call\nit a bug.  I've got round the problem by adding grDevices to the list\nin my ~/.Rprofile file.\n\nOthers might have a better explanation, of course.\n\nHTH\n\n\n-- \n~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.   \n   ___    Patrick Connolly   \n {~._.~}          \t\t Great minds discuss ideas    \n _( Y )_  \t  \t        Middle minds discuss events \n(:_~*~_:) \t       \t\t Small minds discuss people  \n (_)-(_)  \t                           .....
