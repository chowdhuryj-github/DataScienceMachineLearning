The decision \ntree will highlight in a monotonic sense which variables in respective order \ndrive the clusters into groups. The algorithm is upside down in a sense, but \nit does help to identify what is driving your clusters apart.\n\nThis might help to identify the bigger differences in some of the groups\n\nRemember when comparing cluster groups you need to look at differences \nbetween the groups and also the standard deviation (dispersion around \nclusters)\n\nHTH Paul\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Monica Pisica\" \nTo: \nSent: Wednesday, April 11, 2007 11:31 PM\nSubject: [R] Kmeans cluster analysis\n\n\n> Hi Nataniel,\n>\n> As far as i know there is a package called clustTool which has a very nice\n> interface with the capability to do different cluster analyses.
