I have a linux box that needs to go out on\nthe Internet and I am getting two wrt54G v2 routers.  Is there a way in\nOpenwrt to allow only a certain ip address on to the Internet without\nactually letting all the other systems hang out on the Net.  I forget the\nactual term it is something like Nat forwarding or redirection.\n\nScott\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca [mailto:speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca]\nOn Behalf Of Garrett Klein\nSent: Friday, June 08, 2007 2:39 PM\nTo: Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\nSubject: Re: Wireless Router\n\nStephen,\n\nI would recommend the wrt54gl, the reason being that you can reflash it with\nopenwrt (http://www.openwrt.org) and get ssh access/iptables firewall\naccess. I've got two of these with OpenWrt and a decent firewall\nconfiguration, and have had no problems.\n\nGarrett\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Dawes, Stephen\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Friday, June 08, 2007 10:05 AM\nSubject: Wireless Router\n\n\n> This is slightly off topic, but I am looking for opinions on which\n> wireless router to purchase.\n>\n>\n> Steve Dawes\n> Phone: (403) 268-5527\n> Email: SDawes@calgary.ca\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> NOTICE -\n> This communication is intended ONLY for the use of the person or entity\nnamed above and may contain information that is confidential or legally\nprivileged.
