I have a problem that _must_ have a very simple solution  \n(that I can't find).\n\nI use the module Getopt::Long to read arguments, one of which is a  \nfile path that may have spaces. The path string that is returned from  \nGetopt has spaces without escape chars.  The string seems to be fine  \nfor Perl use, but not so great for other things, such as the Shell  \nmodule, which can't handle the spaces.\n\nI have to assume that paths can be converted easily for use in shells  \nand such, without resorting to RegEx. Any ideas?\n\nMike\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
