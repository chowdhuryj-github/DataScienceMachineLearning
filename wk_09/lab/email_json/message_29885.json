'by' is optional...\n\nLike this:\n\nfrom......by......\nor\nfrom......\n\nI want all the stuff inside.\n\nInitially I'm thinking\n/from (.+?) (?:by (.+?))?/\n\nAnything better?\n\nI can negate a character  with [^b] to mean not-'b'\nbut can I negate a word?\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
