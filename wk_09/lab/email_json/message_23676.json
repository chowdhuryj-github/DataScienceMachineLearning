However, i would like to integrate a\nloop in the function below. So that the script calculates for each\nvariable within the dataframe df1 the connecting data in df2. Actually it\ntakes only the first row. I hope that's clear. My goal is to apply the\nfunction for each data in df1. Many thanks in advance. An example is as\nfollows:\n\ndf1 <-data.frame(b=c(1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9,10))\ndf2 <-data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5), y=c(2,5,4,6,5), z=c(10, 8, 7, 9, 3))\nattach(df2)\nmyfun = function(yxz) (x + y)/(z * df1$b)\ndf1$goal <- apply(df2, 1, myfun)\ndf1$goal\n\nregards,\n\nkay\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
