Whether we should develop them to\nalso cover the logos is an interesting question for later, but not\nreally about the general approach.\n\n> Was the discussion held on debian-legal (back in April) intentionally\n> left over?\n\nYes, it was intentionally left out.  It seemed to be discussing\nProposedTrademarkPolicy, which is an option on the poll.\n\n> [...] I already pointed it out to you [...]\n\nSorry, I'm lagging.  Now I've decided that some are deliberately\ntrying to snow me under by trying to make me do me pointless tasks,\nI'm firewalling them, so things will improve.\n\n> Is this poll open to DDs only?\n> Or is anyone interested encouraged to participate?\n\nOpen to all.  I think this affects all contributors, whether DD or\nnot, commercial or not.\n\nHope that clarifies,\n-- \nMJ Ray - see/vidu http://mjr.towers.org.uk/email.html\nExperienced webmaster-developers for hire http://www.ttllp.co.uk/\nAlso: statistician, sysadmin, online shop builder, workers co-op.\nWriting on koha, debian, sat TV, Kewstoke http://mjr.towers.org.uk/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
