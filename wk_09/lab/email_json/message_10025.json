You don't have \"Macros\" in R, because you don't need them :\nyou use functions, which are much more powerful.\n\nYou can refer to the following document, written by Bob Muenchen, for\nmore informations on the differences between SAS and R : \n\nhttp://oit.utk.edu/scc/RforSAS&SPSSusers.pdf\n\nHope that helps,\n\n-- \nJulien Barnier\nGroupe de recherche sur la socialisation\nENS-LSH - Lyon, France\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
