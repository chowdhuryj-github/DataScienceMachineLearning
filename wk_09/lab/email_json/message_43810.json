The idea is to use the sequential probability ratio test boundaries to stop resampling for a Monte Carlo hypothesis test such as a bootstrap or permutation test. This means that you will take many samples when the p-value is close to the significance level (e.g., 0.05), but you may stop after a much  fewer samples if it becomes clear that the p-value is either very likely to be less than or more than 0.05. \n\nThe details are described in:\n\n\t\tFay, MP, Kim, H-J, and Hachey, M. (2007). \"On using Truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test Boundaries for Monte Carlo Implementation of Hypothesis Tests.\" (to appear in Journal of Graphical and Computational Statistics).  \n             http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dcr/BRB/staff/michael\n\n\nPlease let me know of any problems or if you have any comments. \n\n\nMike\n\n******************************************************************\nMichael P.
