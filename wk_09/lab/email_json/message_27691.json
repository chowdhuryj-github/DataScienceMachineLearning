I think the difference in signs is just\nconvention within fields.  In choice models (the econometric\ntradition), we usually write that the response is in a higher category\nif\n\neta + random > cutpoint\n\nand that's how I created the data--rlogis supplies the random noise.  Then\n\neta - cutpoint > random\n\nor\n\ncutpoint - eta < random\n\nand so\n\nProb ( higher outcome ) = Prob ( random > cutpoint - eta)\n\nIn the docs on polr from MASS, V&R say they have the logit equal to\n\ncutpoint - eta\n\nso their parameterization is consistent with mine.  On the other hand,\nyour approach is to say the response is in a higher category if\n\n intercept + eta > random,\n\nwhere I think your intercept is -cutpoint. So the signs in your\nresults are reversed.\n\n-cutpoint + eta > random\n\n\nBut this is aside from the major question I am asking.  Do we think\nthat the augmented data frame approach described in Cole, Allison, and\nAnanth is a good alternative to maximum likelihood estimation of\nordinal logit models, whether they are interpreted as proportional\nodds, continuation, or stopping models?   In the cases I've tested,\nthe parameter estimates from the augmented data frame are consistent\nwith polr or lrm, but the standard errors and other diagnostic\ninformations are quite different.\n\nI do not think I can follow your suggestion to use penalties in lrm\nbecause I have to allow for the possibilities that there are random\neffects across clusters of observations, possibly including random\nslope effects, but certainly including random intercepts for 2 levels\nof groupings (in the HLM sense of these things).\n\nMeanwhile, I'm studying how to use optim and numeric integration to\nsee if the results are comparable.\n\npj\n\n> See if using the PO model with lrm with penalization on the factor does\n> what you need.\n>\n> lrm is not set up to omit an intercept with the -1 notation.\n>\n> My book goes into details about the continuation ratio model.\n>\n> Frank Harrell\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nPaul E.
