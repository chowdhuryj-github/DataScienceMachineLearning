Given  \nthe small pixel size this should also look pretty satisfactory even  \nthough there is only 1 bit of alpha and no real blending.\n\nSo is this still planned or are you going to switch to 24 bits once  \nthe LX arrives?\n\n- Bert -\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
