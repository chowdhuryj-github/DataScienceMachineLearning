I've got lots of work on those, and would like to keep moving with my projects.\nThanks,\n~~TheCreator~~\n[My programs don't have bugs; just randomly added features]\nmsn:\ncompgeek13@gmail.com\naim: st8amnd2005\nskype: st8amnd127\nvertigo head coder\nweb: tysdomain.com\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
