Former vice presidential chief of staff I. Lewis\n  \u201cScooter\u201d Libby was slapped with 30 months in prison and fined\n  $250,000 for lying and hindering the CIA leak case investigation. Bob Orr\n  will have the story.\n\u00a0\nAn appeals court struck down a new U.S. policy against accidentally\n  aired profanities on TV and radio. The decision noted that what\u2019s\n  considered vulgar language is now so common even President Bush uses it\n  (remember what he told Tony Blair that Hezbollah should stop doing?). Now, a\n  sudden slip of the tongue \u2013 even on air \u2013 will likely be excused.\n  That could come as a relief to some broadcasters, but the FCC isn\u2019t so\n  thrilled, Nancy Cordes will report.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, our chief foreign correspondent Lara\n  Logan is in Baghdad\n  embedded with a unit that discovered what\u2019s thought to be an al Qaeda\n  dumping ground. She\u2019ll report on what she\u2019s seen and also show\n  you new video of a massive attack on Iraqi insurgents.\n\u00a0\nAthletes could have a quicker new way to get up and\n  running after joint injuries. Our Dr. Jon LaPook will report on a therapy\n  that extracts a patient\u2019s own blood platelets and puts them back in the\n  injured area so they can help the body heal itself. \n\u00a0\nFinally, Wyatt Andrews will report for Shades of America\n  on groups of inner-city students who got a little help from their friends\n  \u2013 to attend and graduate college. It is a scholarship program that\n  stresses the importance of students\u2019 \u201cposse\u201d as a support\n  network through college \u2013 and it is having outstanding results.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us for these stories and\n  more,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
