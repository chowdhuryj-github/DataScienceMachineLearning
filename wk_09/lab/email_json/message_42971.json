The tinderbox\n  script generates the mail message, and my plan for now is to send it\n  out manually when something changes in the results.\n\n* Do we want these messages to go to sugar@, or is that too spammy?\n  We can create another list if needed.\n\n* Could we have the logs/*.log files contain only one copy of the\n  Python tracebacks?  That would make these mails easier to follow.\n\n* I guess it would be easy to keep a dictionary of \"activity name \n  => maintainer e-mail address\", and then CC: the maintainers of\n  broken activities on these mails.  Good idea?\n\nLet me know if you have any other ideas about features for this.  \nThanks,\n\n- Chris.\n-- \nChris Ball   \n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
