If the arc is symmetrical around\na vertical line, then it is not so difficult to draw it that way.\nBut an arc that does not have this kind of symmetry would possibly\nrequire some geometrical computations to find the proper rectangle\nto be used for clipping.\n\nI would like to suggest that in a future version of R some function\nbe included in the graphics package to draw smooth arcs with\ngiven center, radius, initial and final angles. I suppose\nthat the basic ingredients are available in function \"symbols\"\n(graphics).\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPaulo Barata\n(Rio de Janeiro - Brazil)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nProf Brian Ripley wrote:\n> On Tue, 1 May 2007, Greg Snow wrote:\n> \n>> Here is an approach that clips the circle you like from symbols down to\n>> an arc (this will work as long as the arc is less than half a circle,\n>> for arcs greater than half a circle, you could draw the whole circle\n>> then use this to draw an arc of the bacground color over the section you\n>> don't want):\n>>\n>> library(TeachingDemos)\n>> plot(-5:5, -5:5, type='n')\n>> clipplot( symbols(0,0,circles=2, add=TRUE), c(0,5), c(0,5) )\n> \n> I had considered this approach: clipping a circle to a rectangle isn't \n> strictly an arc, as will be clear if the line width is large.\n> Consider\n> \n> clipplot(symbols(0, 0 ,circles=2, add=TRUE, lwd=5), c(-1,5), c(-1,5))\n> \n> Note too that what happens with clipping is device-dependent.
