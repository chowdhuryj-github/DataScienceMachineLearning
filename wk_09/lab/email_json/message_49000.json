It contains bivariate data and data in this Min Max mode.\nI had to alter the multivariate data into min max, because I had more  than one number in one species and also I had to alter the unordered  multivariate data into bivariate data for the same reason. Now I am  looking for a similarity algorithm or approach  in R that is able to  deal with this data and further gives the possibility to weight the  variables differently.\nBy the way it would be fine if this approach would be also able to  treat numerical data. I hope somebody can help me.\nBest regards\nBirgit\n\n\n\n\\ufffc   \\ufffc\nBirgit LemckeInstitut f\u00fcr Systematische BotanikZollikerstrasse 107CH-8008 Z\u00fcrichSwitzerlandPh: +41 (0)44 634 8351birgit.lemcke@systbot.uzh.ch\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
