While that second constraint is always an\nimportant one, cleanliness is not the highest concern.  There's more\nto beauty than what the eye can see.\n\nI believe that **{1..3} was at one point spelled <1,3>.  The rather\nglaring inconsistency of that is that <>-constructions are always\nassertions, never modifiers.   That is to say, in the rest of the\nregex design, whenever you see , it never depends on what comes\nbefore it.\n\nAnother important loss if we were to go with <1..3> would be the\nability to have runtime-dependent ranges; e.g.:\n\n    / ($ntimes) x**{$ntimes} /\n\nYou also lose the ** exponentiation mnemonic, which I found pretty on\nthe inside :-).  You also lose the *-like (because it really is just a\nspecial kind of *) mnemonic.  I think the losses are too great to\nwarrant such a change just for the purpose of visual appeal.\n\nLuke\n\n"}
