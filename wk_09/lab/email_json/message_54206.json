Yes, Perl is great at\nstring manipulation; but you have your Perl program, you're happy with\nit, it's your Java code that you're wondering about improving. If you\nask the Java people, they can give you better answers about improving\nyour Java code. And they're especially eager when they hear that Java\nneeds help to compete against Perl.\n\nCheers!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
