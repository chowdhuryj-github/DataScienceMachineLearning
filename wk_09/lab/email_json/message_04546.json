Now if you have a matrix w such that w'w = W (just the square\nroot of the weights if using the diagonal matrix) and you define x* = wx\nand y*=wy, then if you do regular regression (ols) on y* and x* you get:\n\n(x*'x*)b = x*'y* => ( (wx)'(wx) ) b = (wx)'(wy) => ( x'w'wx )b = x'w'wy\n=> (x'Wx)b = x'Wy \n\nWhich is the weighted least squares (wls).  So doing a regular\nregression on y* and x* gives a weighted regression, so it would stand\nto reason that doing a ridge regression on y*=wy and x*=wx would give\nsomething along the lines of a weighted ridge regression (I am not an\nexpert on ridge regression, so I don't know if there are any hidden\ntraps to this approach).\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
