Gable writes: 'So what happens if the target of the\nattack refuses to pay? The DoS extortionist is obligated to carry out a\nprolonged DoS attack against them to follow through on their threats. For\na DoS extortionist, this is the worst scenario because they have to risk\ntheir bot network for nothing at all. Since the target has refused to\npay, it is likely that they will never pay.
