The astronauts, meanwhile, have tested the ship's re-entry systems and are in the final stages of packing up for the return to Earth.\n\n\"I can't wait to get back and feel the air on my face and the sea breeze,\" space station astronaut Sunita Williams, wrapping up a record six-month stay in orbit, told a reporter today. \"I'm looking forward to hopefully going to the beach and taking a walk with my husband and my dog. That's the first thing. And secondly, I just can't wait for a good piece of pizza.\"\n\nWilliams and her shuttle crewmates - commander Rick Sturckow, pilot Lee Archambault, flight engineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas and Jim Reilly - will have two opportunities on successive orbits to land at the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday.\n\nHere is an updated timeline of key events (in EDT):\n\nRev. 202 Deorbit to KSC\n\nEDT...........EVENT\n\n08:49:54 AM...Begin deorbit timeline\n09:04:54 AM...Radiators stowed\n09:14:54 AM...Mission specialists seat installation\n09:20:54 AM...Computers set for deorbit prep\n09:24:54 AM...Hydraulic system configuration\n09:49:54 AM...Flash evaporator checkout\n09:55:54 AM...Final payload deactivation\n10:09:54 AM...Payload bay doors closed\n10:19:54 AM...Mission control 'go' for OPS-3 software\n10:29:54 AM...OPS-3 transition5\n10:54:54 AM...Entry switchlist verification\n11:04:54 AM...Deorbit PAD update\n11:09:54 AM...Crew entry review\n11:24:54 AM...Commander/pilot don entry suits\n11:41:54 AM...IMU alignment\n11:49:54 AM...CDR/PLT strap in; mission specialists don suits\n12:06:54 PM...Shuttle steering check\n12:09:54 PM...APU prestart\n12:16:54 PM...Toilet deactivation\n12:24:54 PM...Vent doors closed for entry\n12:29:54 PM...Mission control 'go' for deorbit burn\n12:35:54 PM...Mission specialists seat ingress\n12:44:54 PM...Single APU start\n\n12:49:54 PM...Deorbit ignition (dV: 199 mph; dT: 2:36)\n12:52:30 PM...Deorbit burn complete (alt: 212.8 statute miles)\n\n01:23:48 PM...Entry interface (alt: 75.5 miles)\n01:28:46 PM...1st roll command to left\n01:40:25 PM...1st left-to-right roll reversal\n01:48:44 PM...Velocity less than mach 2.5 (alt: 16.2 miles)\n01:50:56 PM...Velocity less than mach 1 (alt: 9.6 miles)\n01:51:54 PM...Shuttle on the HAC (alt: 6.9 miles)\n01:55:16 PM...Landing\n\n\nRev. 203 Deorbit to KSC\n\n01:05:23 PM...MCC 'go' for deorbit burn\n01:11:23 PM...MS seat ingress\n01:20:23 PM...Single APU start\n\n01:25:23 PM...Deorbit ignition (dV: 201 mph; dT: 2:38)\n01:28:01 PM...Deorbit burn complete (alt: 213.8 statute miles)\n\n02:58:41 PM...Entry interface (alt: 75.6 miles)\n03:03:37 PM...1st roll command to left\n03:14:55 PM...1st left-to-right roll reversal\n03:23:35 PM...Velocity less than mach 2.5 (alt: 16.3 miles)\n03:25:48 PM...Velocity less than mach 1 (alt: 9.5 miles)\n03:26:27 PM...Shuttle on the HAC (alt: 7.7 miles)\n03:30:07 PM...Landing\n\nDespite expected bad weather, NASA does not plan to staff backup landing sites Thursday. If the weather doesn't cooperate, the astronauts will back out of the deorbit timeline, open the shuttle's cargo bay doors and stay in space an additional day.\n\nHere is an updated list of all available landing opportunities, at Kennedy (KSC), Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. (EDW), and White Sands Space Harbor, N.M.
