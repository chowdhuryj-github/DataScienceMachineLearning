Do you know which are the outliers?\n\nYou can either fit to the 'regular data' with princomp and use predict() \nto get the 'scores' for all the data, or use a robust method to find the \n'covmat' argument (as the help page says, you could use cov.mcd from \nMASS) and call princomp() on all the data.\n\n\n-- \nBrian D.
