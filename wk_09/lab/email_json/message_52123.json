(Highly non-Euclidean \ndissimilarities are likely to be slower.)\n\nEven 1000 objects is a lot to be considering for what is primarily a \nvisualization technique.\n\nCruder forms of MDS such as Kohonen mapping are able to handle much larger \ndatasets (but reveal less about them).\n\n-- \nBrian D.
