With the GFDL, for\ninstance, I expect that among the people voting to allow it into main were\npeople who believe that the GFDL license terms sans invarient sections\ntruly are DFSG-free, people who feel the DFSG is too restrictive, people\nwho think that they aren't DFSG-free but we should make an exception for\nthe GFDL, people who feel the DFSG are only guidelines and shouldn't be\napplied restrictively, and probably several other opinions.\n\nThere's no way of separating those out afterwards, and I don't think we're\nlikely to come up with a reasonable ballot on a single license that would\ndo so.\n\n-- \nRuss Allbery (rra@debian.org)               \n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
