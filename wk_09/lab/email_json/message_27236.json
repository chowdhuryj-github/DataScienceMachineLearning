That\u2019s the message moderate Republicans had for President Bush \n      after they pulled him into a private meeting for what has been called a \n      \u201cvery frank\u201d discussion earlier this week. Our chief White House \n      correspondent, Jim Axelrod, will provide details about that \n      meeting. Sharyl Attkisson will report from Capitol Hill on how \n      Congress and President Bush may now be working toward a compromise on the \n      crucial issue of setting benchmarks for progress in Iraq. The \n      maker of OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded \n      guilty today to misleading the public about how addictive the powerful \n      drug can be. A U.S. Attorney said the company unleashed an easily abused \n      drug on an \u201cunsuspecting and unknowing public.\u201d The company has agreed to \n      pay hundreds of millions of dollars. Correspondent Bob Orr will \n      have the story. Two forces of nature are clashing in the southeast \n      as massive wildfires continue to torch the Florida-Georgia border. Not far \n      away, the first named storm of the year has brought a sprinkling of rain \n      to help firefighters there, but tinderbox conditions elsewhere in the \n      country are contributing to new fires. Kelly Cobiella will report. \n      It might be heating up all along the East Coast \u2013 for good \u2013 if a \n      new NASA report is right. Randall Pinkston will share the \n      disturbing report about just how hot our planet could get before the turn \n      of the century. Elizabeth Palmer will report from London on \n      the news today that one of America\u2019s best friends, British Prime Minister \n      Tony Blair, is stepping down. We\u2019ll look back at his decade in office. \n      To cap our broadcast, Kelly Wallace will have an Eye \n      on the American Family report. She\u2019ll take a \n      look at the phenomenon called \u201copting out.\u201d It\u2019s the idea that \n      high-powered career moms are deciding to stay at home with their kids \n      rather than work full-time. But now some experts are saying when women \n      stop working, it may not be voluntary. Thanks!

With most \n      killers, you usually detect a problem in their childhood or a personality \n      defect that causes that person to choose to take the ultimate action \n      against another human being. But what would lead a young man with no \n      history of violence to do something so out of character? It is just one of \n      the mysteries that surrounds the murder of 21-year-old Catherine Woods. \n      First, some background: Catherine Woods was a stunning and \n      talented young woman, from my hometown of Columbus, Ohio, who moved to New \n      York with hopes of becoming a dancer and singer on Broadway. As the \n      daughter of the well-known director of the Ohio State University Marching \n      Band, Catherine was used to the spotlight and dreamed of her own name in \n      lights along the Great White Way. But, three years later, on November \n      27th, 2005, she was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Initially, \n      police focused on two suspects, neither of which fits the profile of a \n      killer. They are both young, aspiring musicians with no criminal records. \n      Catherine's murder was exceptionally brutal which makes it all the more \n      difficult to believe that either man could have done it and yet, one was \n      arrested, charged and tried for her murder. In this week's program \n      Death of a Dream, we investigate the evidence and follow the trial \n      that ends with a dramatic and surprising verdict. It is a case that will \n      remind you, as so many of our cases do, how a single, senseless act in a \n      moment of passion, can have drastic consequences for so many.\" - \n      Erin Moriarty (48 Hours Mystery airs Saturday at \n      10pmET/9CT) If you would like more information on any of these \n      stories or the broadcast, please click on the following address and e-mail \n      us at: 48hours@cbsnews.com \n\n\n\nSUNDAY ON 60 \n      MINUTES, 7:00PM/6:00PM CT \nMITT ROMNEY \u2013 The Republican presidential candidate talks to \n      Mike Wallace about campaign issues including the war in Iraq, his \n      Mormon religion and his changing positions on abortion. 6% \n      - Realtors\u2019 sacrosanct commission rate of 6 percent may be in jeopardy \n      due to emerging online competition from Internet real estate sellers and \n      buyers.
