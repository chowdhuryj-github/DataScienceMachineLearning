Best solution?", "body": "Hi all,\nMy father is a person who expects Windows XP to be on my machine every day.\nThe deal is.\nI bought a new gateway in April origenally intended to be the replacement Windows machine. But I have been considering running Linux natively entirely alone on it, and whiping Windows, and perhaps virtually running it instaead.\nProblem is, My dad, who cannot understand much less begin to learn Linux, cannot stand anything then Windows.\nI considered turning my pentium into a Windows box again, but relaly cannot aford to lose Linux on that box either.\nA couple of months agoe, my dad logged in to my box, expecting a desktop, start menu, etc.\nHe saw a Linux log interminal, prompting for a password.\nSo he shut the system down improperly.\nAfter that, I had to restore Windows from a clone.\nI have done this too many times! And now I am being told by my dad who owns the electrical power (and who could kick my but and such) that I cannot, run Linux, whatsoever) and that he may unplug/ground me off the computer.\nAny suggestions? This is really an act of unfairness!\nBut how can I explain to a sighted man who has a tempor and who cannot stand Linux or anything different? Thanks! Regards, --Keith\nSkype- add skypedude1234\nIn fact, I only use WIndblows because of Skype. That's it.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
