There\u2019s been one significant \n      development already \u2013 debt relief for that war-torn country. But the even \n      bigger news might be the rare contact today between U.S. officials and \n      those from Syria.

Smart, ambitious, tough and attractive she quickly ascended to \n      one of the highest offices in the state and many expected she'd eventually \n      end up working in national politics. But last year Kathy Augustine was \n      found unconscious in her bed and later died at the hospital. She was \n      fifty-years-old. At first it was assumed that Augustine died from a heart \n      attack. But her family and friends didn't believe it could be possible. \n      Augustine had her annual physical just a week before her death. She was \n      given a clean bill of health and there was no family history of heart \n      disease. It just didn't add up. Toxicology tests were ordered on \n      fluid samples taken from Augustine and the results shocked everyone. \n      Traces of the powerful paralytic drug Succinylcholine were found in her \n      system. The drug is normally given to patients to ease the insertion of a \n      breathing tube. It acts fast and nearly vanishes from the body within \n      minutes...making it extremely difficult to detect. Suspicions quickly fell \n      on Augustine's husband of three years, Chazz Higgs. The pair seemed an \n      unlikely couple. He was eight-years her junior. He was a bodybuilder who \n      had three failed marriages behind him. His relationship with Kathy was \n      troubled as well. In the months leading up to Augustine's death they had \n      discussed divorce. But there was more. Chaz Higgs was a critical care \n      nurse and he had access to Succincolyine. He knew how to adminster it and, \n      most importantly, he knew the drug could be potentially deadly. And then a \n      witness came forward with a damning claim about his allegedly role in the \n      crime. Chazz Higgs goes on trial for the murder of Kathy Augustine \n      next month. Higgs claims he is innocent. When we sat down for the \n      interview, that you'll see this weekend, he agreed to talk about the \n      charges against him...charges that could send him to prison for life, and \n      you'll hear his theories on who would want his wife dead...and why. I hope \n      you'll join us on Saturday night.\" Troy Roberts\n(48 Hours Mystery airs Saturday at 10pmET/9CT)\nIf you would like more information on any of these stories or the \n      broadcast, please click on the following address and e-mail us at: \n      48hours@cbsnews.com \n\nSUNDAY ON 60 \n      MINUTES, 7:00PM/6:00PM CT INSIDE THE ENEMY CAMP -- \n      Until Osama bin Laden declared all Americans and Jews fair targets for al \n      Qaeda terror, Nazir Abas trained Muslim militants in the jungles of South \n      East Asia.
