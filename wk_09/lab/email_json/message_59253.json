I'm also allowed a virtual private server for my site and such, which I can access via SSH.  I guess I have a desire to learn how all that works internally.  I'm not gonna run a massive site off it or anything, but maybe host some files and just a personal page.\nI was wondering if anybody here is familiar with Cent OS.  I'm not, though have heard it's based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  I'm not familiar with Red Hat in general.\nAny tips from anybody?\nThanks muchly,\nZack.\nPS: I wish I could host it myself, but I'd need to talk to my ISP about getting a static IP, and anyway it isn't my connection.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
