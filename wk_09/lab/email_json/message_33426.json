I want know how to conduct a\nhypothesis test : Ho:|E(X)|=|E(Y)|<->H1:otherwise.\n\nActually, in my study, X and Y is two observations of bias,\nwhere bias=u^hat-u, u is a parameter I concerned. Given X=(u^hat_xi - u) and\nY=(u^hat_yi - u), I want to know which bias is smaller, or the absolute\nexpection of which is smaller. Due to limit of sample size, I think we\ncannot make a conclusion by comparing the absolute mean value of each\nsample. So I turn to a means of  hypothesis testing as I post in the title.\n\nNow my strategy is using permutation test. Like this:\n\npermutation.test.bias=function(x,y,mc=1000){\n n1=length(x)\n n2=length(y)\n n=n1+n2\n xy=c(x,y)\n dbar=abs(abs(mean(x))-abs(mean(y)))\n z=c()\n for(i in 1:mc){\n  mn=sample(1:n,n1)\n  z[i]=abs(mean(xy[mn]))-abs(mean(xy[-mn]))\n }\n p.value=sum(abs(z)>dbar)/mc\n p.value\n}\n\nAlthough it seems plausible, this function doesn't work\n> n=1000\n> x=rnorm(n)+10\n> y=rnorm(n)-10\n> permutation.test.bias(x,y)\n[1] 0\n\nI think there should be other test methods for this problem.\n\nThanks for any suggestion/solution.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nJunjie Li,                  klijunjie@gmail.com\nUndergranduate in DEP of Tsinghua University,\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
