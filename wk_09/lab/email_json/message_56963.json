A\nsimple example would be to allow unequal variances across groups. So if\nyour call to lme was: \n\nlme(...,random=~1|group,...)\n\nthen to allow each group to have its own variance, use:\n\nlme(...,random=~1|group, weights=varIdent(form=~1|group),...)\n\nYou really really should read Pinheiro & Bates (2000). It's all there.\n\nHTH,\n\nSimon.\n\n, On Wed, 2007-06-27 at 21:55 -0400, shirley zhang wrote:\n> Dear Spielas and R-help,\n> \n> Does lme assume normal distribution AND equal variance among groups\n> like anova() does?
