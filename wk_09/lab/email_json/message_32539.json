The article's author suggests that the\nformat was designed for the benefit of the content-producers and not the\nconsumer. The result is a signal that's hard to route and switch, as well\nand unnecessarily complicated cable assemblies. They reach back to the\nDVI standard to see what might be done to make HDMI a little more\nconsumer-friendly, with numerous technical elements woven through the\ndiscussion. \"DVI lacked a couple of things which the consumer audio/video\nindustry wanted. It was implemented on a variety of HD displays and\nsource devices, but it was confusing for the consumer because of the many\nvariants on the standard and different connector configurations, and it\ndidn't carry audio signals. A consortium to develop and promote a new\ninterface, HDMI, was formed; the idea was to come up with a standard\nwhich could be implemented more uniformly, was less confusing, and\noffered the option of routing audio signals along with video.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/05/18/2147207\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.audioholics.com/education/cables/whats-the-matter-with-hdmi\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
