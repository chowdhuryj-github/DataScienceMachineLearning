I think the biggest issue is\nthe long horizontal bar of the arrow cursor.  On other conventional\nplatforms, the default arrow cursor is tyipcally more \"pointy\".  And,\nnow I see there is a good reason for it (As one of my friend Abe-san\nsuggested).\n\n  Sugar seems to opted to match the cursor's appearance with the XO\nlogo and design of other icons, but not sure if that really justifies\nthis.\n\n  Unfortunately, this is more of a problem in Etoys as it doesn't\nchange the cursor to the I-beam form by default.  In Etoys, you can\nembed things to others and make Text a button for example, so a\nblanket policy to change the cursor to the I-beam is not what you\nwould want, probably.\n\n  (It is true that we haven't done empirical usability study with kids\non XO.  But, we should aspire such study over mere \"kids opinion\".)\n\n-- Yoshiki\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
