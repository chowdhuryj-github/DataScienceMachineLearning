I am sorry if I did not explain my  \nproblem clearly. English is not my native language and statistical  \nenglish is even more difficult. I'll try to summarize my issue in  \nmore appropriate statistical terms:\n\nEach of my observations is not a single number but a vector of 5  \nproportions (which add up to 1 for each observation). I want to  \ncompare the \"shape\" of those vectors between two treatments (i.e. how  \nthe quantities are distributed between the 5 values in treatment A  \nwith respect to treatment B).\n\nI was pointed to Hotelling T-squared. Does it seem appropriate? Are  \nthere other possibilities (I read many discussions about hotelling  \nvs. manova but I could not see how any of those related to my  \nparticular case)?\n\nThank you very much in advance for your insights. See below for my  \nearlier, more detailed, e-mail.\n\nOn 2007-May-21  , at 19:26 , jiho wrote:\n> I am studying the vertical distribution of plankton and want to  \n> study its variations relatively to several factors (time of day,  \n> species, water column structure etc.).
