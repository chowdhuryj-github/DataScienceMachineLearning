The error occured because \nyour indexing object 'nii' does not exist where R is looking for it.\n\n2. using rbind on dataframes is a bad practice, since the input is \nconverted to marices if possible. Use merge() instead.\n\nPetr\n\n> \n> \n> What I need, is to combine all the six together, and give for example\n> NA-value in day 1, for those columns which can only be found in day 2.\n> Is this somehow possible?\n> \n> I have several of these six-datasets groups, and only few of them are\n> having this problem described above, and I cannot know in advance which.\n> With most of the groups writing\n> rbind(data1,data2,data3,data4,data5,data6)\n> works easily, but these few problematic groups need also to be\n> combined... \n> Any help greatly appreciated!\n> \n> -Jouni\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n> \n\n-- \nPetr Klasterecky\nDept. of Probability and Statistics\nCharles University in Prague\nCzech Republic\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
