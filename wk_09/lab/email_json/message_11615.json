The library is \ndual-licenced -- under the GPL and under a commercial licence. GPL is \nfor open-source consumers and commercial licence is for closed-source \nconsumers.\n\nNow I create Python binding to that library - pyfoo. Now I would like to \ndual-licence it myself, under the same terms -- GPL and a commercial \nlicence.\n\nNow to get the right of dual-licensing, do I have to obtain a commercial \nlicence from the author of libfoo?\n\nIf yes, why? If no, why not? Please elucidate. Thanks.\n\nShriramana Sharma.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
