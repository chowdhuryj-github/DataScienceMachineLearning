I did find some reduced functionality such as \nalignDailySeries in package:fCalendar but the full capability of \naligning two timeseries seems to be missing.\nCould this be true ? I am sure there must be a need for this useful function.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks !\n\nMarkus\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
