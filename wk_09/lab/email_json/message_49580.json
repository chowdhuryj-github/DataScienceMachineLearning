Try declaring your variable, with 'my', in the outer\nscope. That is, the variable should be declared in the innermost scope\nin which it will be needed; you've declared yours in too narrow a\nscope.\n\n> I tried to make it a global variable at the\n> beginning by using \"our @SLPdataSFO = ();\" to make it a global\n> variable, but no luck there.\n\nYou must have done something else wrong, since that should work. But a\n'my' variable is a better choice than a global, generally.\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
