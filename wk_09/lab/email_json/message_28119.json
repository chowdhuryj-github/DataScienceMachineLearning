Well the answer\n  a non surprising NO!\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n=====================================================================\nSamba                                    ------- http://www.samba.org\nCenteris                         -----------  http://www.centeris.com\n\"What man is a man who does not make the world better?\"      --Balian\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.4 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGRYEHIR7qMdg1EfYRAhBqAKDihqPWekjDUT/HkzkeTRABBUR32ACdHmqb\nUC+WDefzUSvrs4P/3zdns10=\n=tIpE\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
