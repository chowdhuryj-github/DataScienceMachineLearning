I found a result that would like to obtain some explanation here. My setting is that I have 2 variate time series. I use ca.jo to perform Johansen test. 1. I found that sometimes, in the case where the ca.jo test statistics suggest that I have 1 relationship. After I investigate the ect obtained from cajorls (with r=1), the ect series fails unit root test like adf.test completely. I still see high degree of non-stationarity. Would you please provide some insight?2. The opposite of above also occurs. I found that the statistics suggests that I have no cointegrated relationship. But when I tried to perform adf.test on the ect, it gracefully rejects the null hypothesis of I(1). 3. Sometimes I found test statistics for both r <= 1 and r <= 0 are statistically enough. How should I interpret this result? Do I have 1 cointegrated relationship or not at all?Any explanation would be really appreciated. Thank you.- adschai\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
