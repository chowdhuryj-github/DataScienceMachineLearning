I guess that this is better described as a\n> \"contrasting\" than a \"complementary\" colour.\n\nSince luminance contrasts are necessary and sufficient for readable text, \nyou could use white for dark colors and black for light colors.\n\nLuminance is roughly proportional to  0.2*(R^2.4)+0.6*(G^2.4), suggesting \nsomething like\n\nlightdark<-function (color)\n{\n     rgb <- col2rgb(color)/255\n     L <- c(0.2, 0.6, 0) %*% rgb\n     ifelse(L >= 0.2, \"#000060\", \"#FFFFA0\")\n}\n\nThis uses a pale yellow for dark backgrounds and a dark blue for light \nbackgrounds, and it seems to work reasonably well.\n\n \t-thomas\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
