Thanks.\n\nThe true formula of weighted variance is this one:\n\thttp://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/ch2/ \nweighvar.pdf\nBut for computation purposes, wtd.var uses another definition which  \nconsiders the weights as repeats instead of true weights. However if  \nthe weights are normalized (sum to one) to two formulas are equal. If  \nyou consider weights as real weights instead of repeats, I would  \nrecommend to use this option.\nWith normwt=T, your issue is solved:\n\n > a=1:10\n > b=a\n > b[]=2\n > b\n[1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n > wtd.var(a,b)\n[1] 8.68421\n# all weights equal 2 <=> there are two repeats of each element of a\n > var(c(a,a))\n[1] 8.68421\n > wtd.var(a,b,normwt=T)\n[1] 9.166667\n > var(a)\n[1] 9.166667\n\nCheers,\n\nJiHO\n---\nhttp://jo.irisson.free.fr/\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
