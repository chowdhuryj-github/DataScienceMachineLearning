It is very \nsimple answer at this question: I have not yet met the one who will turn \nupside down all my life.\nI need such man who will appreciate not only my body, but see the beauty of \nmy inner deep world.\nI know that we are not acquinted, but I want to use this chance, because it \ncan't repeat again.\nSo, I am happy to meet you. I am very glad to greet you in my life if you \nwant.\nYou can believe me or not, but i am a woman-fire who can make your life more \ninteresting and full of bright impressions.\nhow do you like the idea of mornings' breakfasts in the bed, romantic walks \non week ends, happy family evenings after working days?\nAs for me I dream about it every day. I am tired to come at lonely home, to \ncook meal only for one person and to eat at loneliness and to go asleep at \nloneliness too. I want to come at home and to meet my beloved, to kiss him,\nto cook him tasteful meal, to feel secured and happy every monrning and \nevery night.\nI will close this letter, but it doesn't ordinary letter, it is a call to \nbuild love and change your life to better and to forget about lonely days.\nI will wait for letter with hopes in my heart\nhttp://myhearthwithlove.com/likes\n\nThe best of luck\n\nYulechka\n\n\n"}
