The documentation hints: \"Alternatively, 'method'\ncan be a list of functions 'init', 'split' and 'eval'\", but doesn't\nprovide any details as to what those methods should do or what\narguments they should take etc.\n\nI've tried looking at the package source (and the source for the S\ncode it came from) but I can't follow what's going on in C vs R, and\nas the default methods are coded in a different way, there are no\nexamples to follow.\n\nThanks,\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
