As FASB standards align accounting operation more towards contractbased portfolio valuation and fair market value, the energy industry faces ever growing complexity in their finance and accounting operations. In addition, the new Energy Policy Act of 2005 has changed the dynamics of FERC and State regulatory requirements simultaneously. Hear how energy risk management and finance/accounting professionals, rating agencies, and investment banks have sorted through and prepared for these changes.\n\u00a0\nWHO SHOULD ATTEND\n\n                      This conference is suited to investors, energy executives, corporate risk managers, finance and accounting directors, and industry professionals involved in the oversight of risk management, and finance/accounting operations for energy companies and investment banks.\n\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n  Alternative \n                            Regulation for Electric and Gas Utilities\n Boston, MA\n June 25-26, 2007\n  In Depth \n                            Introduction to Electricity Markets\n  Alexandria, VA\n June 25-26, 2007\n  Carbon \n                            Emissions: Understanding and Managing Carbon Risk\n  Alexandria, VA\n June 25-26, 2007\n  Customer \n                            Communications for Utilities\n Boston, \n                            MA\n June 27-28, 2007\n  Public \n                            Participation in Utility Siting\n Boston, \n                            MA\n June 27-28, 2007\n  Implementation \n                            and Cost-Benefit of Workplace Weight Management Strategies\n  Chicago, IL\n June 28-29, 2007\n\u00a0\n  Carbon \n                            Sequestration Development & Finance Summit\n  Houston, TX\n July 11-13, 2007\n  Coal Combustion \n                            Products\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  T & D Asset \n                            Management\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  Wind Power \n                            Development Tutorial\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 16-18, 2007\n  FERC Electric \n                            101\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 17-18, 2007\n  Electric Power \n                            Planning\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  NERC Reliability \n                            Standards\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  Project Finance \n                            Tutorial\n New \n                            York, NY\n July 23-25, 2007\n  Diversity and \n                            Inclusion- Best Practices\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-25, 2007\n  Energy \n                            Efficiency, Demand Response and Load Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-27, 2007\n  Revenue \n                            Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 26-27, 2007\n  New FERC Filing \n                            and FASB Fair Valuation Standards\n  Chicago, IL\n July 30-31, 2007\n  Power Delivery \n                            Planning: Managing the Distribution Planning Process to Maximize \n                            Value\n  Chicago, IL\n Aug 1-2, 2007\n  Electric Safety \n                            in Utilities\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 15-16, 2007\n  Protective \n                            Relaying\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 16-17, 2007\n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
