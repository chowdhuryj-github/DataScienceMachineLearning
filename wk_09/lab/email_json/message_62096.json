I download the olpcgames wrapper from coderanger, and follow the steps of \nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/Game_development_HOWTO but when I start the activity I can start the game.. even the main screen load.I think this can be because this game is like an point and click game, using all the time the mouse.\nSo, anyone have suggestions? -- Att,Pedro Kayatt\n"}
