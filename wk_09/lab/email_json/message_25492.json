As you discovered, you get the same coefficients with\ncase weights as with variance weights, but different standard errors.\nFinally, there are \"sampling weights,\" which are inversely proportional to\nthe probability of selection; these are accommodated by the survey package. \n\nTo complicate matters, this terminology isn't entirely standard.\n\nI hope this helps,\n John\n\n--------------------------------\nJohn Fox, Professor\nDepartment of Sociology\nMcMaster University\nHamilton, Ontario\nCanada L8S 4M4\n905-525-9140x23604\nhttp://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox \n-------------------------------- \n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch \n> [mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of hadley wickham\n> Sent: Tuesday, May 08, 2007 5:09 AM\n> To: R Help\n> Subject: [R] Weighted least squares\n> \n> Dear all,\n> \n> I'm struggling with weighted least squares, where something \n> that I had assumed to be true appears not to be the case.  \n> Take the following data set as an example:\n> \n> df <- data.frame(x = runif(100, 0, 100)) df$y <- df$x + 1 + \n> rnorm(100, sd=15)\n> \n> I had expected that:\n> \n> summary(lm(y ~ x, data=df, weights=rep(2, 100))) summary(lm(y \n> ~ x, data=rbind(df,df)))\n> \n> would be equivalent, but they are not.
