Use your web browser and load the index.html file. \n  It sounded like a pretty well written pamphlet on the system.  I'm \nused to books being a little larger.   I assume you'll have to \nvisit Sourceforge for additional packages and install them into \n/usr/local.  How they missed dos2unix I don't know, but the 'tr' command \nshould do for removing carriage returns.\n\n         Michael\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
