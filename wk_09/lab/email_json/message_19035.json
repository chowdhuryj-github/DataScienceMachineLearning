My question is should I calculate ordinary variance and covariances, taking pairwise variables? or I should take partial covariance between any two variables, keeping other fixed. In my decent opinion is I should go for the second option?\n> \n> Your help will be highly appreciated.\n> \n> Thanks and regards,\n> stat\n> \n>        \n> ---------------------------------\n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
