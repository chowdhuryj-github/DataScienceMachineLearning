I feel putting a\nmanpage under the FDL is stupid because then the manpage has to include\na copy of the FDL, which is far longer than a typical manpage.\n\nThis may be related to bug 412272 or bug 388246\n\nPlease report a bug against gcc-doc (or gcc?) if you agree that\nnon-inclusion of the FDL means that the man page is undistributable.\n\nIf you would like to take it further, please research whether the GCC\nmaintainers know that using the FDL for a manpage has problems.  Some GNU\nprojects use info files, so maybe the manpage in non-free was not made\nby them - in which case, it says nothing about the GNU FDL fiasco.\nIf it is their man page, then it means yet another mature GNU project\nhas been confused by the FDL.\n\nHope that helps,\n-- \nMJ Ray - see/vidu http://mjr.towers.org.uk/email.html\nExperienced webmaster-developers for hire http://www.ttllp.co.uk/\nAlso: statistician, sysadmin, online shop builder, workers co-op.\nWriting on koha, debian, sat TV, Kewstoke http://mjr.towers.org.uk/\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
