It really gets \nin the way of many kinds of \"pointing and hitting\" operations: text, \nsmall buttons, etc.\n\nWhat do you think? Could we make this cursor smaller? Could we make \nits shape a little more pleasing?\n\nCheers,\n\nAlan\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
