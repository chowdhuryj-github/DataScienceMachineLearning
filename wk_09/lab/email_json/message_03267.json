I'd like to plot it as an image. To that end, I have used the  \nimage() function that seems to do what I want. Now, I just want to  \ntweak it to look perfect. So here is my question:\n\nAt the moment, the values of the axis range from [0, 1]. I want it to  \nshow the row and column of the matrix. How do I do that?\n\n  Thanks in advance.\n\nWee-Jin\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
