R  \nextensions are so numerous that it is difficult to keep up with them.  \nWould it be appropriate to ask package developers to add a brief  \nsentence about what the package does, when they announce updates?\n\nI would benefit from such descriptions.\n\nCheers,\nHank\n\nDr. Hank Stevens, Assistant Professor\n338 Pearson Hall\nBotany Department\nMiami University\nOxford, OH 45056\n\nOffice: (513) 529-4206\nLab: (513) 529-4262\nFAX: (513) 529-4243\nhttp://www.cas.muohio.edu/~stevenmh/\nhttp://www.muohio.edu/ecology/\nhttp://www.muohio.edu/botany/\n\n\"E Pluribus Unum\"\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
