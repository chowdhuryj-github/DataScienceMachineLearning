Then I\nwant to replicate the pc scores for all the duplicated rows for that\nindividual.\n\nAny idea how to do this?\n\nUp to now I have been using princomp to only select the entries which are\nnot duplicated which is easy, but the difficult bit is the programming to\nduplicate the pc scores across the entries for each individual.\n\n(I developed something that worked but it takes about 5 minutes to run!)\n\nThanks for all your help,\n\nvery much appreciated,\n\nSimon.\n\n\n\n\nSimon Pickett\nPhD student\nCentre For Ecology and Conservation\nTremough Campus\nUniversity of Exeter in Cornwall\nTR109EZ\nTel 01326371852\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
