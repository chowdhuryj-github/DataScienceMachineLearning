You probably want something like `formail -s\n> procmail  for each individual message.\n\nthat'd use ~/.procmailrc if any; if you want procmail to deliver as if msgs \nwere from fetchmail, that's fine - though I'd rather set -Y:\n\n% formail -s procmail -Y .procmail/debian-list.rc < Mail/inbox\n\nassuming Mail/inbox is in mbox format, of course; if the *.rc is a generic\nfiltering recipes set, you may want to use the -m flag instead:\n\n% formail -s procmail -m -Y .procmail/debian-list.rc < Mail/inbox\n\nbut me careful that debian-list.rc doesn't have a rule that delivers to\nMail/inbox ;)\n\n--\npaolo\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
