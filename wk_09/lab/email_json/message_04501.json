Just googling for CRAN gsubfn  where gsubfn is the package\nname in this example will often work too.\n\nSome packages have a home page that gives information.   If you have\ninstalled the package, e.g. gsubfn, then\n\nlibrary(help = gsubfn)\n\nwill list the home page.in the Description: section under URL.  The\nhome page may have more info.  For example, in the case of gsubfn\nit has a public svn source repository.\n\nOn 4/12/07, Sione  wrote:\n>\n> Dear Users,\n>\n> I am new to R, I have just downloaded it to play with.
