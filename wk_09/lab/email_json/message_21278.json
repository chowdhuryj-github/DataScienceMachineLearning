WARNING\n\n'library' or 'require' calls not declared from:\n\n  MASS\n\nSee the information on DESCRIPTION files in the chapter 'Creating R\n\npackages' of the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.\n\n \n\n \n\n* checking if this is a source package ... WARNING\n\nSubdirectory 'GLDEX/src' contains object files.\n\n \n\nIn my package I have only used the dataset from MASS by way of examples,\nI wonder if it is customary to include all the libraries even if you\nonly use them as examples? \n\nThe second warning I am not sure about, I wonder if it just means I have\nmore files other than the source codes in the /src folder? \n\n \n\nThanks in advance for your comments.\n\n \n\nSteve.\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
