Below I\ndocument the same:\n\n\n\nUnlike S-Plus, R doesn't handle Multivariate GARCH models.\nR has a package for BEKK GARCH model but not for DVEC GARCH models.\nThe GARCH function in S-PLUS has the capability of fixing some model\nparameters at certain values to evaluate the fit of a particular model. But\nthe same optionality is not provided by the GARCH models in R.\n\n\nSo, how can I overcome these difficulties which I am facing in R? Are these\nprocedures in the development stage of R? (I mean the packages are yet to be\nbuilt?)..Any developmental work going on with this?\n\nThank a lot for your help,\n\nShubha\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
