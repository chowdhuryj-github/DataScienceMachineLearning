They bookended Annie and she was saying something to them, first looking up to speak to Goliath, then half-turning and looking down to reply to David.\n\n\nOnly now she was starting to lose it. He crumpled the wet paper with a convulsive closing jerk of his fist and slammed it into her mouth, driving the half-charred first bunch farther down.

The woman had cut off his foot with an axe and his thumb with an electric knife, and here she was with a pile of caviar big enough to choke a warthog. Every possible approach seemed mined.   Some part of him that was as addicted to the chapter-plays as Annie had been as a child had decided he could not die until he saw how it all came out.
