What table and what images?

Why\nare you asking for such a large amount of data at once? Do you want to\nread the entire file, or merely the first 512K?\n\n> As long as I use $buff it works fine and only in INSERTS but when I try to\n> assign this to another variable\n> like $check_buff = $buff and use this variable to update the image it\n> doesn't work.\n\nI can't see what you're trying to do, or how it's not working for you.\nCan you show us the code? Cut it down to a small example that other\npeople could try to run, and somebody will be able to guide you\nfurther.\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
