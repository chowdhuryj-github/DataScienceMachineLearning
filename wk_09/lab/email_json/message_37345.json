I tried running the newest \ngrml earlier today, 1.0 in vmware and had a very odd thing happen. I \ndid get speach, but, it was studdering really bad and had lowd pops \nat the start of every word so I could bearly understand anything it \nwas saying. This happend two times, when I typed grml swspeak at the \nboot prompt, it took about 10 seconds, and I got some speach, but, I \ncould not understand anything it said, and, then, after it finished \nbooting, I typed swspeak as it says to do in the cheat codes for grml \nand I once again had speach. I could not understand this either. As I \nsaid, it has some very lowd hissing pops that almost completely cover \nthe speach, so, very hard to understand anything. I also noticed that \nin the cheat code notes, it said something about a vmware code that I \ncould use at the prompt, but, I did not understand how to use it. I \nhave not had any problems getting any other distro to boot with \nspeach, such as ubuntu using orca, orilux, debian using speakup and \nmy doubletalk lt, etc. So, maybe I am just doing something wrong, or, \nit's something with grml itself? If someone can give me some idea of \nwhat to do to fix it, or, point me to something to read, I would be greatful.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
