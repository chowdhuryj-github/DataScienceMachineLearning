I have begun to use R under LINUX. When I run under windows, I get a standard terminal window, but I don't get the menus specific to R. Under windows I also have the ability to open a SCRIPT window, edit R code in the window and submit the code from the window. Is there any way to get a window with R specific menus and a script window?\nThanks\nJohn\n\nJohn Sorkin M.D., Ph.D.\nChief, Biostatistics and Informatics\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine Division of Gerontology\nBaltimore VA Medical Center\n10 North Greene Street\nGRECC (BT/18/GR)\nBaltimore, MD 21201-1524\n(Phone) 410-605-7119\n(Fax) 410-605-7913 (Please call phone number above prior to faxing)\n\nConfidentiality Statement:\nThis email message, including any attachments, is for the so...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
