The first\nthing I want to know is: Can I boot a speakup enabled linux, and use\nmy hardware synth through vmware? Not sure how I would have to go\nabout setting up the serial port issue, and, if that will not work,\nwhat would it take to get vmware running on linux, and, from there,\nrunning xp on the vm once I had it going? Would I be able to use\nscreen readers in that vm, or, would I run into any trouble?\nI am really new to all this, so, all the help I can get would be wonderful.\nThanks bunches.\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
