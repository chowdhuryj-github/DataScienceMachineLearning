The important\nthing is to create a unified desktop, which normally incorporates all\nof the artworks. The installer and the splash artworks should function\nas a branding images, therefore they should be simple and visually\nrevealing in order to burn the brand in the mind of the user with the\nleast possible effort on his part. Yet, they have to fit perfectly\ninto the general look and feel of the desktop.\n\nJmak\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
