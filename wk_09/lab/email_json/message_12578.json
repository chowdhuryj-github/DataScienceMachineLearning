As the regular \"kmeans\" available from stats package in R does'nt provide the option to change the distance method. I was wondering there is any package available to specify type of distance measure to be used in k means clustering in  R. Especially distances like \"Jaccard\" which is good for binary data. \n   \n               Thanks chandra\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
