The FSF clearly state that you may\nmake edits to the GPL, but that you must then\n* remove the preamble\n* rename the license to something else (it must not be \"GNU General\n  Public License\" anymore, then)\n\nWhile I have no issue with either and agree with your conclusion anyway,\nit's not the same thing as \"using copyright on the license to prevent\nincompatible changes\"\n\n-- \n Home is where you have to wash the dishes.\n  -- #debian-devel, Freenode, 2004-09-22\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
