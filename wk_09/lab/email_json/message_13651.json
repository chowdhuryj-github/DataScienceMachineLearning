Since I may well\nhave done a poor job searching I thought I'd ask here prior to\ngiving up.\n\nI understand that SAS's proc nlmixed can accomodate censoring\n(though proc mixed apparently can't), so if I can't find \nsomething available in R, I'll have to break down and use\nthat.  Please, save me from having to use SAS!\n\nThanks much,\nSpie\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
