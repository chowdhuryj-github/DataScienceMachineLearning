We have a binary package that was not maintained for\nabout a year, and the original maintainer is not around anymore.\nThe package used to work in R-1.5.1.  I used the following steps\nto install this package in R-2.4 on WinXP:\n\n  Started the GUI\n  Went into the menu \"Packages\" and selected \"Install packages from\n  local zip files\n  Clicked on the zip file with the package, and clicked \"Open\"\n  \nR responded with the message \"Updating HTML package descriptions\".\nI can see the package files in the \"library\" subdirectory of\nR installation:\n\ncd \"c:/program files/R/R-2.4.1/library\"\nfind . -name 'Rproj' -print\n./file72ae2cd6/Rproj\n./file72ae2cd6/Rproj/help/Rproj\n./file72ae2cd6/Rproj/R/Rproj\n./Rproj\n./Rproj/help/Rproj\n./Rproj/R/Rproj\n\n( Please don't get confused by the UNIX-style paths, I am using cygwin\nshell on Windows ).\nHowever when I go to \"Packages->Load package\" menu, the Rproj \npackage is not listed there.   How would I find out what went wrong?\n\nThanks,\n\tVlad\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
