So somehow you have managed to install prada without an essential \ndependency 'rrcov'.  That looks like a problem in the Debian/Ubuntu \npackaging of prada.  (There is a list R-sig-debian for such issues.)\n\nRunning install.packages(\"rrcov\") inside R should fix this for you: if \nyour R is not current (i.e. < 2.5.0) you may need to run R as root for \nthat session.  (There may be a Debian package for rrcov for your OS and R \nversion, but without further details I cannot check.)\n\nIn the current version of prada (1.12.0 for BioC-2.0 for R 2.5.0) rrcov is \nin Imports, so probably your version of BioC is not current either.\n\n[...]\n\n-- \nBrian D.
