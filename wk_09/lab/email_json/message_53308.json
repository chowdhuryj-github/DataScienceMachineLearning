I may just totally destroy Windows after cloning it (on the off-chance) that I ever require it again.\nHowever, I am considering teaching my father about Linux, explaining it to him (if I can, or if he will listen to me that is)\nAlso, I can easyily let him navigate around the Gnome desktop and use Firefox to do his online research. He wouldn't be on that much, and I could then kill X-Windows and go back to running server apps.\nNot sure still, though.\nOh and a minor note to all:\nI do not have a floppy drive in this thing, just one of those internal nine-in-one media reader devices.\nAlso: Although my website and such is online, Noone appears to be accessing it or they can't.\nCould I have someone test this?\nThe site is available at:\nhttp://www.KeithNet.DynDNS.org\n\nIf that just doesn't work, just try using:\nKeithNet.DynDNS.org.\nRegards, --Keith\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
