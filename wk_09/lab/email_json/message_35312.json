S02 says that there are three main contexts (void, scalar,\nand list); that scalar context has a number of \"sub-contexts\"\n(boolean, integer, number, and string), and that list context has a\nnumber of sub-contexts based on the container type.  The difference\nbetween '@' and '@@' seems to be 'list context' vs. 'lisp context', as\nit were - i.e., whether or not nested lists should be flattened.  How\nthis maps to required roles, I'm still not sure.\n\n-- \nJonathan \"Dataweaver\" Lang\n\n"}
