From the article: 'Gene\nsequencing revealed a mutation specific to humans that triggers a change\nin the splicing pattern of the neuropsin gene, creating a new splicing\nsite and a longer protein. Introducing this mutation into chimpanzee DNA\nresulted in the creation of type II neuropsin. \"Hence, the human-specific\nmutation is not only necessary but also sufficient in creating the novel\nsplice form,\" the authors state.' The team is urging further analysis of\nthe extra 45 amino acids in type II neuropsin since they believe that\nchain may cause protein structural and functional changes.
