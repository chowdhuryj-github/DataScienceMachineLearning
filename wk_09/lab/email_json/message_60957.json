A polymer\ncalled PVDF has interested physicists as a possible high-performance\ndielectric. It exists in two forms, polarized or unpolarized. In either\ncase, its structure is mostly frozen-in and changes only slightly when a\ncapacitor is charged up. Mixing a second polymer called CTFE with PVDF\nresults in a material with regions that can change their structure,\nenabling it to store and release unprecedented amounts of energy.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/02/2029232\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070702150050.htm\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Allofmp3 Shut Down, Again                                          |\n|   from the e-roller-coaster dept.                                  |\n|   posted by ScuttleMonkey on Monday July 02, @18:27 (The Internet) |\n|   http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/2046241          |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nstudguy1 writes to tell us TorrentFreak is reporting that the Russian\ngovernment has [0]shut down Allofmp3, the popular online music site.\n\"AllOfMP3 has been a thorn in the side of the RIAA and the US government\nfor years.

Libby was\nconvicted in March of obstruction of justice in connection with the\nValerie Plame affair. The President's action spares Libby from 30 months\nbehind bars.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://politics.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/07/02/2239240\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-CIA-Leak-Trial.html?hp\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2006 OSTG.
