How can I do model and code this?\n \nAgain, b is a power term of a and b^a are divided by c.\n \nThank you,\nJeff\n \n \n\n\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \n\nPM\n \n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
