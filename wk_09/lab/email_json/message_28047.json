(more details)", "body": "Dear Donny,\n\nI don't normally get drawn into these kinds of things, but for the sake of\nargument, you should probably hear these things.  Let's address your\ncookie-cutter \"talking points,\" one by one.\n\n1) You stated \"I will never agree that carbon dioxide is pollution. In\nfact, without carbon dioxide, there's no photosynthesis and we all die.\"\nOf course, we all need copper in our bodies, or we would die.  However,\ntoo much copper will kill you.  Too much copper in the soil, trouble  We\nall need water in our bodies, or we would die.  However, too much water\ncan kill you (water intoxication, check it out, or, hey, drowning).\nThere's all kinds of things that are necessary in the proper balance, or\nterrible things result.  Too much of a good thing.  Hell, too much\nnitrogen wouldn't be good, and all of the protein in your body contains\nit.\n\nOf course, you already know that.  You're just using a bad analogy to\nsupport your argument.  If you wish to be intellectually honest, you may\nNEVER use that as a talking point, ever again, in any discussion, with\nanyone.\n\n2) Global Cooling - Your statement was that \"not a single scientist\" was\nable to answer \"Why did we have global cooling through the 1950s, 1960s\nand half of the 1970s?\"  This is correct, in so far as a single scientist\ndid not answer it.  More accurately, several scientists HAVE answered it.\n\nLet's have a quick tour of global cooling, shall we?  Global cooling, that\nbrief cooldown around the 70's, back when we first started keeping really\naccurate data, was mostly due to the release of sulfate aerosols, which we\nhave since ceased to do.  Sulfate aerosols have a large cooling effect.\nSince you like Wikipedia, check out\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change#Attribution_of_20th_century_climate_change.\n Notice the light purple line in the chart, for the negative contribution\nof sulfate emissions.  You can see that the modeled temperatures follow\nthe observed ones pretty well - that means that our science is getting\nmore accurate.  The Global Cooling article on Wikipedia has a heck of a\nlot of info.  Check it out.\n\nYou have now been informed on this topic, since your stance was that no\nscientist has ever answered it before.  They have.  If you wish to be\nintellectually honest, you may NEVER use that as a talking point, ever\nagain, in any discussion, with anyone.\n\n3 & 4) Optimum recommendations of temperature and carbon dioxide levels.\nAside from medical science, scientists do not make \"optimum\nrecommendations.\"  They made predictions based on past data and explain\nobservations.  The question might be better phrased as \"optimum\nrecommendations in order to do ... what?\"  Well, if you want a lot of\nstorms and some new coastlines, yeah, let's let it cook for a while\nlonger.  The dinosaurs liked it nice and toasty, too.  We can look at\nhistorical data, obtained from as many sources as we can get, and make\nsome fairly educated calculations.  Clearly, nobody wants to jack up the\nsurface albedo so high that we get another little ice age.\n\nScience isn't going to answer the question for you, \"How hot do you like\nyour room?\"  You'll have to figure that out for yourself, based on the\nconsequences.  Scientists haven't determined a favorite color, either.\n\nIt boils down to something very simple ... we have precisely one (1)\nplanet upon which we may experiment.  We don't get another one if we screw\nit up (unless you believe in The Rapture).  This leads me, personally, to\nerr on the side of caution.  We are already powerful enough to make\nspecies go extinct, make new species, divert entire rivers for our\ntransportation needs, poison areas and make them uninhabitable, turn\ndeserts into oases, and so forth.  We have those abilities.  It's not a\nstretch to think we could affect the atmosphere, too.\n\nNow, you probably will keep using that global cooling thing, and the bit\nabout needing carbon dioxide, but, since I have called you on it, just\nremember that you now know better, every time you use it.\n\nOf course, I have a sneaking suspicion that, as someone from\njesusanswers.com, you figure that the Second Coming will just take care of\nany messes people make.\n\n> In article <3YidnXU4GN0x7dnbnZ2dnUVZ_h2pnZ2d@giganews.com>,\n>  yellowmatter@gmail.com (yellowmattercustard) wrote:\n>\n>> Donny Bravo wrote:\n>>\n>> > Global Warming is not about pollution.
