During that period 29 women on drug A and 80 on drug\nB had the disease.  The incidence of disease for A and B was 0.24% and 0.30%\nrespectively.  However, instead of reporting these numbers, they report the\n1-p figure which was 0.3% for A and 0.6% for B. \n\n \n\nSo, the incidence from 1-p was substantially higher than the actual\nincidence.  My question is: is it appropriate to use 1-p estimated from\nKaplan-Meier as the incidence of disease?  If not, why not? \n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nNguyen\n\n \n\n____________________________ \nNguyen Dinh Nguyen, \n\nBone and Mineral Research Program \nGarvan Institute of Medical Research \nSt Vincent's Hospital \n384 Victoria Street, Darlinghurst \nSydney, NSW 2010 \nAustralia \nTel; 61-2-9295 8274 \nFax: 61-2-9295 8241 \nE-mail: n.nguyen@garvan.org.au \n\n \n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
