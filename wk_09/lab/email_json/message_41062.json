I'd really like to\nsee an activity called \"Collage\" which is something like a modern\ndescendent of Hypercard.  It should take the idea of embedding media\nfurther, of course allowing images, sounds, video and text, but\nperhaps also supporting live logo turtles, live editable text boxes\nand other interactive forms.  Ideally, there would be an interface\nwhich made it pluggable so that any activity could embed its formats\nand provide hooks for interacting with it.\n\nBringing it all together, it should support a basic logo-like\nscripting language.  This could allow simple actions like \"next page\",\nbut could also be allowed to pull text from the live text boxes via\nsome identifiers, animate the embedded objects, track some basic mouse\nand keyboard events, and interact with hooks provided by the plugins.\n\nA child could create a single page, or a simple slideshow, but by\ntaking full advantage of the nature of the scripting which pulls\nthings together, they can create non-linear books, interactive\nanimations, science reports with embedded interactive experiments,\ngames, and more.\n\nAs fun as this would be for kids, I also see this as being a fantastic\nformat for teachers to create lesson plans in:  provide some\ninstructions with text and images, embed a video about the topic,\nscript up a little physics simulation that the kids can experiment\nwith, embed an abiword table widget which automatically records the\nresults of the experiment, and place some questions with textboxes at\nthe end so the kids can answer them and then turn in their \"lab.\"\nHeck, you could even automatically check the answers when they are\ndone, or interactively assist them when they answer incorrectly,\nnudging them along or referencing the results table again.\n\n- Eben\n\n\nOn 6/2/07, Rebecca Gettys  wrote:\n> Hi All,\n> I think that sideshows CAN be very sueful in the class room, and they\n> have actually taught be to pay attention to detail.
