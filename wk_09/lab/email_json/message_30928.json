All:\n\nI wonder if someone has done this before...\n\nI am writing several functions that conduct statistical analysis using a \nGUI interface by Tcl/Tk, they share many identical GUI components. What \nI am trying to do now is to simplify the code by writing a GUI \nrepository for all the components they use, thus save effort for code \nmaintenance.\n\nSince they all use:\n\nmainFrame <- tkcanvas(top)\n\n--\n\nI wonder if I can write functions that take mainFrame as an argument, \nand call those functions from other place with initialized tkcanvas \nobject. I did not see example like this and from my *limited* experience \nwith tcltk, I found it always need something to be initialized before \nput to use, that makes me wonder if this idea will work... if it does \nnot, any work arounds? like using Macro?\n\nThanks\nHao\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
