The overall goal is to enforce\nthose DACLs... but one step at a time.\n:)\n\nFor my own part, I am interested in a clearer understanding of the\ninteractions between the VFAT bits, the POSIX bits, the current behavior of\nthe default VFS module, and what needs to be done to make NTFS ACLs work\nproperly.  I know Jeremy has put a lot of effort into understanding how the\nDACLs work in particular (I remember a presentation... what... six years ago?).\n\nYour input on next steps would be appreciated.\n\nChris -)-----\n\n-- \n\"Implementing CIFS - the Common Internet FileSystem\" ISBN: 013047116X\nSamba Team -- http://www.samba.org/     -)-----   Christopher R.
