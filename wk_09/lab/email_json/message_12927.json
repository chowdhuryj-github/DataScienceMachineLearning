The changes\n   are extensive and I think they make the code much clearer. Rather than\n   just check it in, I thought I'd try to get feedback here to make sure\n   that it is clearer to everyone else and not just to myself.\n\nGreat; thanks!  Your patch handles everything I can throw at it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Bob Rogers\n\t\t\t\t\t   http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/\n\n"}
