The samr and spoolss pipes\nstill need some work in either the IDL or pidl before we can\nwork on bringing over so for now, ignore them.  The netlogon\nand srsvc code can be done using the proxy call mechanism.\nI'll start on bringing them in next.\n\nWhat I would like to see is for us to convert the remaining\ncalls one by one.  I suggest that any new calls *must* use\nthe pidl generated code.  There is no reason to hand write\nmarshalling code any more.\n\nThanks to Jelmer and Volker to all their previous work\nand advice to make this an easier task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheers, jerry\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQFGXz1mIR7qMdg1EfYRAuzjAJ9kiy14kl0CC+lvbOZe0D8gAaw0GwCfUY43\nwdurQlgdAGL2w7pP2IBJjEs=\n=Hy35\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
