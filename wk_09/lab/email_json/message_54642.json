The shingle merely chops up the data along the \nx-axis, so it is easy to identify which part of the shingle a panel is \nin by looking at the x-axis markings. I only want to have a strip at the \ntop for the factor.\n\nIs this possible? I looked into calculateGridLayout() and it seems to me \nthat there isn't an easy way to do it without rewriting that function \n(and others).\n\nMany thanks\n-- \nMichael Hoffman\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
