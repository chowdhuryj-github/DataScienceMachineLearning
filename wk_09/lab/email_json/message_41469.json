Every beginning ends something.\nNothing is worth doing unless the consequences may be serious.\nThis book is not to be tossed lightly aside, but to be hurled with great force.\nGreat geniuses have the shortest biographies.\nI destroy my enemy when I make him my friend.\nDon't change horses while crossing a stream.\nInfatuated, half through conceit, half through love of my art, I achieve the impossible working as no one else ever works.\nThe undertaking of a new action brings new strength.\nIt is not how old you are, but how you are old.\nIf you always do what interests you, at least one person is pleased.\nNobody told me how hard and lonely change is.\nAmerica is a young country with an old mentality.\nThe most fearful unbelief is unbelief in your self.\nScornful men bring a city into a snare, but wise men turn away wrath.
