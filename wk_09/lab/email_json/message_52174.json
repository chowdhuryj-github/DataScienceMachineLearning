I'd think it'd be in their best interest to do so, since  \nit would mean fewer support calls, fewer complaints, and most of all,  \nfuture compatibility regardless of linux distro the client is using.\nBut, that's just me.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
