I would\nreally appreciate if somebody could guide me to a resource on how to\nuse grid to modify such graphics. I guess the basic approach will be\nsimilar to using grid to modify lattice graphics. To that extent\nsomething that explains use of grid to modify lattice graphics may\nalso be useful.\n\nI have gone through vignettes in the grid package but am somehow not\nable to understand the overall approach. It would be useful if there\nis something more specific that deals with using grid to modify such\ngraphics.\n\nVikas Rawal\nAssociate Professor\nCentre for Economic Studies and Planning\nJawaharlal Nehru University\nNew Delhi\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
