Rather, it requires that those using whatever software\ndemonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that the software does what it's\nsupposed to do appropriately. This includes a lot more than assuring, say,\nthe numerical accuracy of computations; I think it also requires\ndemonstration that the data are \"secure,\" that it is properly transferred\nfrom one source to another, etc. I assume that the statistical validation of\nR would be relatively simple, as R already has an extensive test suite, and\nit would simply be a matter of providing that test suite info. A bit more\nmight be required, but I don't think it's such a big deal. \n\nI think Wensui Liu's characterization of clinical statisticians as having a\nmentality \"related to job security\" is a canard. Although I work in\nnonclinical, my observation is that clinical statistics is complex and\ndifficult, not only because of many challenging statistical issues, but also\nbecause of the labyrinthian complexities of the regulated and extremely\ncostly environment in which they work. It is certainly a job that I could\nnot do.\n\nThat said, probably the greatest obstacle to change from SAS is neither\nobstinacy nor ignorance, but rather inertia: pharmaceutical companies have\nover the decades made a huge investment in SAS infrastructure to support the\ncollection, organization, analysis, and submission of data for clinical\ntrials. To convert this to anything else would be a herculean task involving\nhuge expense, risk, and resources. R, S-Plus (and much else -- e.g. numerous\n\"unvalidated\" data mining software packages) are routinely used by clinical\nstatisticians to better understand their data and for \"exploratory\" analyses\nthat are used to supplement official analyses (e.g. for trying to justify\ncollection of tissue samples or a pivotal study in a patient subpopulation).\nBut it is difficult for me to see how one could make a business case to\nchange clinical trial analysis software infrastructure from SAS to S-Plus,\nSPSS, or anything else.\n\n**DISCLAINMER** \nMy opinions only. They do not in any way represent the view of my company or\nits employees.\n\n\nBert Gunter\nGenentech Nonclinical Statistics\nSouth San Francisco, CA 94404\n650-467-7374\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Frank E Harrell Jr\nSent: Friday, June 08, 2007 7:45 AM\nTo: Giovanni Parrinello\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] \"R is not a validated software package..\"\n\nGiovanni Parrinello wrote:\n> Dear All,\n> discussing with a statistician of a pharmaceutical company I received \n> this answer about the statistical package that I have planned to use:\n> \n> As R is not a validated software package, we would like to ask if it \n> would rather be possible for you to use SAS, SPSS or another approved \n> statistical software system.\n> \n> Could someone suggest me a 'polite' answer?\n> TIA\n> Giovanni\n> \n\nSearch the archives and you'll find a LOT of responses.\n\nBriefly, in my view there are no requirements, just some pharma \ncompanies that think there are.  FDA is required to accepted all \nsubmissions, and they get some where only Excel was used, or Minitab, \nand lots more.  There is a session on this at the upcoming R \nInternational Users Meeting in Iowa in August.  The session will include \ndicussions of federal regulation compliance for R, for those users who \nfeel that such compliance is actually needed.\n\nFrank\n\n-- \nFrank E Harrell Jr   Professor and Chair           School of Medicine\n                      Department of Biostatistics   Vanderbilt University\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
