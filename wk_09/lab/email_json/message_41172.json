Chance favors only the prepared mind.\nA torchlight procession marching down your throat.\nIn this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\nOld men are dangerous: it doesn't matter to them what is going to happen to the world.\nOurs is the only country deliberately founded on a good idea.\nNo one is as angry as the person who is wrong.\nA man is not old as long as he is seeking something.\nLife... It tends to respond to our outlook, to shape itself to meet our expectations.\nGive me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.\nIt is the direction and not the magnitude which is to be taken into consideration.\nAssassination is the perquisite of princes.\nA legend is an old man with a cane known for what he used to do. I'm still doing it.\nTo see your drama clearly is to be liberated from it.\nNo scoundrel is so stupid as to not find a reason for his vile conduct.\nThe consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife.\n\u00a0"}
