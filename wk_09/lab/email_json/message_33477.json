I've had 1175 points for a week.\nI did receive an iPod Shuffle when I earned 1000 points, thank you  \nvery much, but I'd like to work on another one, and I'm not getting  \npoints for the class I attended at Home Depot, or the bid I did on  \neBay, or the book club I joined and that sort of thing. I'm not even  \ngetting points from the \"just give us your zip code or email address.\"\nPlease let me know what is happening.\nThank you\nLinda Eby\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
