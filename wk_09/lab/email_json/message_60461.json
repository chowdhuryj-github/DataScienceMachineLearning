It's\nan easy read split up into chapters that you can finish in an hour and\nexercises at the end of each.\nIt covers file i/o (the essentials) and has enough to let you do some\npractical work.\n\nThen alternatively, there's Programming Perl - the bible of Perl\nBooks. It's pretty heavy though :)\n\nMy favorite (since i like to learn by reading/writing code) is the\nPerl Cookbook. It comes with approaches and code for various common\nthings you might want to do.\n\nHope that helps\nAlex\n\n\nOn Jul 2, 12:35 pm, Mayank.G...@siemens.com (Mayank IN BOM SISL Garg)\nwrote:\n> Hi all,\n>\n> Can some one suggest me a good book on perl (basics and advanced)\n>\n> Thanks & Regards,\n>\n> Mayank Garg\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
