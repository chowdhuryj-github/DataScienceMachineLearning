I would like to\ninclude some data sets for distribution in the package, but have not\ncreated any of these on my own, but have used data distributed in other\npackages such as the LSAT data in the ltm package.\n\nIs it appropriate for me to distribute a data set in the package I\ndevelop even though it originally came from another package? Or, is it\nmore appropriate for my package to depend on the package where the data\noriginally live?\n\nThe functions planned for the current distribution of MiscPsycho will\ninclude:\n\n1) JML estimation of Rasch and Master's partial credit model\n2) Various IRT statistics (e.g., item information and test information\nfunctions)\n3) Various \"Classical\" statistics for item analysis\n4) Coefficient alpha\n5) Score conversion tables\n6) Classification consistency analysis\n7) Procedures for linking scales using mean equating \n\n\nFuture development will include\n\n* 2PL, 3PL, and GPCM also using JML\n* Stocking-Lord procedure\n* Various methods for assessing DIF, including MH\n* Bayesian scoring methods (e.g., EAP)\n\nThe JML procedure is not the world's best technology as MML is commonly\npreferred. However, that is already implemented in the ltm package and\nthese procedures are provided only for those who want to JML option. \n\nThanks,\nHarold\n\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
