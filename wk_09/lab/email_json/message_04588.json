Without an established RTO, planning for comprehensive transmission expansion becomes a combined effort by the states and the utilities that serve them. \nMany entities have taken initiative over the past few years and to date over 20 transmission projects are in some form of development. Yet for the most part, the Western US is building transmission capacity in advance of generation. \nHow will this affect future projects and the long-term outlook on power purchasing from load serving entities?\nWhile much of the planning and siting issues have been and continue to be addressed, issues still remain on the load mix and how states will meet air quality standards and RPS requirements. \nHow do utilities decide what type of power to buy, considering these constraints and what effect does that have on their interest in new transmission? \nFor the numerous renewable energy projects in the West, how does building high capacity transmission encourage development and does it guarantee that renewable electricity will get to the places that need it and/or are required to have it?\n It seems there has been no shortage on the investment end for transmission expansion, yet there are staging issues that can delay the build-out. After initial interest is expressed in specific lines, what does financing look like at different stages for rights-of-way and EIS and then to actual construction? \nThis conference will explore these issues in-depth with utilities, investment groups, regulators and other state officials.\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\n\u00a0\nUpcoming \n  Conferences\n\nBest Practices for Energy Risk Management\nNew York, NY\n  April 8-11, 2007\n  Coal \n  Gasification 2007: The Path Forward\nDenver, CO\n  April 11-13, 2007\n    The 7th Annual National Multicultural Business Conference\nLas Vegas, NV\n  April 11-13, 2007\n   Wall \n  Street Green Trading Summit VI\nNew York, NY\n  April 16-17, 2007\n  Power Delivery \n  Planning I: Getting The Basics Right\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Outsourcing \n  For Utilities\nChicago, IL\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Marketing \n  Green Power\nChicago, IL\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Fundamentals \n  of Distribution Engineering\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Sox-101 for \n  Electric, Gas and Water Utilities ...
