When you have a working tree tar it up and move the tar ball across and extract it, run make and make modules_install and make the necessary amendments to the boot loader configuration file.  I can't remember what switches I used on the compression of the speakup patched tree but a quick look at the tar man page will give an idea.  Not sure if I used anything more than tar -czf linux-2.6.21.5 linux-2.6.21.5-with_CVS_speakup.tar.gz\n\nI guess that there are even more ways you could undertake this task.\n\nGood luck, lfs is a very rewarding process.\n\nActually, I'm being asked by Ken Moffat how they could make their blfs book more accessible to us speakup users, so if you have any ideas, let me know and I'll pass them on.\n\nHTH\n\nGena\n\nAmateur Call: M 0 E B P\n\nVOIP / IM: gena1959uk\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca [mailto:speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca] On Behalf Of Zachary Kline\nSent: Friday, June 22, 2007 8:29 PM\nTo: Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\nSubject: Speakup with LFS?\n\n\nHiya,\n    I was wondering if anybody on here had experience building an LFS system with Speakup in the new kernel.  I have a good idea of how to go about doing it, but don't want to end up with a system that won't talk from boot when I need to try it.  What I was thinking is that since a symbolic link can cross filesystems, I could temporarily change /usr/src/linux to point to the directory of my LFS kernel unpacking.\n    I could then do a CVS checkout--using my existing Linux system, of course, since LFS doesn't come with CVS.  I'd then just change the symlink.\n    Would this work?  \nThanks muchly,\nZack.\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n__________ NOD32 2348 (20070623) Information __________\n\nThis message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\nhttp://www.eset.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
