Several readers, for example, have\nwritten to me saying they'll never invest in Chinese stocks because they\ndon't trust the Communist party.\n\nOther investors restrict their investing to industries they know well. \nOne of my long-time readers, in fact, has always loved Caterpillar stock,\nbecause the company was one of his biggest customers.\n\nAnd many investors hang on to the stock of their old employer forever,\nperpetuating the dependent role long after the rationale for it is gone. \nHere in Salem, for example, you can find many people who will hold General\nElectric stock until the day they die.\n\nNow, sometimes this works out fine.  Over the past forty years, G.E. has\ndone alright by investors, and today it pays a 3% dividend, which is\nappropriate for a lot of those folks.\n\nBut in the long run, you can do much better by opening your eyes, and\nbroadening your horizons.  And the way to do this is to use a totally\nobjective system.\n\nFor us, that's the OptiMo system used by Cabot Top Ten Report.\n\nHere's how it works.  Every Monday morning we arrive in the office to find\na list of ten stocks selected by OptiMo . . . selected solely on the basis\nof their performance.\n\nAnd then we spend the morning researching and writing.  It's no use\nsaying, \"I don't like steel stocks,\" or \"I don't like Brazilian stocks.\nGive me another one.\"  That would defeat the system.\n\nSo we research what OptiMo gives us, and as a result, we're on top of all\nthe market's winners.\n\nA month ago, for example, we wrote up Potash Corp. (POT) when it was\ntrading at 68.  Now, it's safe to say that there's very little love for\npotash in this world, but our research showed us the strong link between\npotash and ethanol.  We recommended it, and today it's 78.\n\nAnother one that most investors would ignore is Cooper Tire and Rubber\n(CTB), which first appeared in Cabot Top Ten on March 5 when it was\ntrading at 19.  The tire business is old and competitive, and you wouldn't\nthink there's much to get excited about there.  But after doing the\nresearch, we liked the story so much we named the stock Editor's Choice\nfor the week.  Today Cooper is at 27, hitting new highs!\n\nAnd then there's MasterCard.  We all know the company, but not many\ninvestors know the stock, and that's because it just came public in May\n2006.  But it popped up in Cabot Top Ten last September, when it was\ntrading at 65.  We recommended it.  And today it's trading over 150!\n\nBottom line: Without an objective system that steers you to all the\nmarket's top performers, you're never going to find all these winners. \nAnd I do want you to be a winner.\n\nSo today, I'm offering a special deal to new subscribers who've never\ntried Cabot Top Ten Report before.  It's very affordable; in fact, the\nprofits from just one good investment will likely pay your modest\nsubscription fee.\n\nFor details, click here.\n\nhttp://cabotmail.net/t/200464/13148861/100/0/\n\n\nYours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,\n\nTimothy Lutts\nPublisher\nCabot Wealth Advisory\n\n\nP.S.
