Lines 24-29\n\n   Generally, when adding a *new test* you should add a new step  \nunless a test\n   I belongs in a current step. For example, if we added a new\n   user-configurable type called C, you should add the test  \nfor its size\n   in F; however, if you were testing what  \ndynaloading\n   capabilities are available, you should create a new step.\n     [Emphasis ** added.]\n\nWhen I come across the phrase 'new test', I immediately wonder what  \nthe 'old' or 'previous' test might be.  But this is the very first  \ntime that the word 'test' is used in this document!  The preceding  \nparagraph talks a lot about adding new *steps*, but makes no  \nreference to adding new *tests*.  This does not appear to mean 'test'  \nin the sense of a test you might find in a t/*.t file.\n\n2.  Lines 96-100\n\n   All steps are really classes; they each exist in a unique  \nnamespace.  The\n   namespace used depends on the tests [sic] relative path in the  \nsource tree minus sans [sic]\n   the F prefix.  For example, the step F uses\n   the C namespace.\n\nFirst of all, it should have been \"test's\" in the second line to  \nindicate the possessive rather than a plural.  Second, you don't need  \nboth 'minus' and 'sans'; deleting 'minus' would probably be better.\n\nBut, here again, the term 'test' appears in this paragraph without a  \npreceding reference in this paragraph or the preceding one.  I would  \nhave expected something more like:\n\n   The namespace used depends on the step's relative path in the  \nsource tree sans the F prefix.\n\nSince I'm not entirely clear as to what's intended in these two  \nlocations, I'm not yet providing a patch.  Can anyone clarify?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\n"}
