I have two covariates, Z and C. I want to examine their relationship under different spatial distribution. \n\nI have no problem simulating completely spatial random process but I'm totally stuck on poisson (cluster) pattern. I already have a dataset with Z and C (obs=575) and I know the relationship between them. Using these 575 cases, how can I simulate a clustered process and have a dataset that has four columns:\n\nx-coor y-coor z c\n\nI know I can use rpois or pcp.sim to generate points that clustered and then use cbind to attach Z and C values. But the problem is my observations will not be spatially clustered. How can I simulate so that now Z is spatially clustered?\n\nThanks!\n\nK.\n \n       \n---------------------------------\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
