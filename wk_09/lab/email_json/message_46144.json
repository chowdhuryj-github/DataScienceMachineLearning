The field of  graphic design\nis also changing rapidly. The majority of advertisement, logos,\nletterheads and all types of signage are now all being produced\non computers.  It is not only the design fields themselves that\nit should be considered and artistic field or not.  On a distorted road, my feet are getting shaky but not my heart. \nI have nothing to give to Mia. My pockets are almost empty. But my heart is filled with love. I will give Mia the pleasure.\n A pleasure that would reflect on her face. I will get her back her long lost shining eyes, her smiles, her vigor, her innocence, \nher childish mischief, everything.I enter the house. Mia is busy washing clothes. I grab her from her shoulders and make her \nstand right in front of me so close that we feel our breaths hitting our faces, our hearts listen to each other's beats, or\n eyes play with together, and I, taking her hands into mine, thrust our fingers together.\nI could easily tell my friends that I have married a riddle. But it wasn't her; it was the system and the atmosphere in which we lived. In such a breath-hindering air, she was not only living alive but was keeping me alive as well. She had kept alive that precious feeling of love that had died in us. To remain alive in such a breathless air, she needed me and I desired her. That's why I never got tired of her strange acts. I couldn't leave her alone. If I had left her alone, I would have become alone as well.\nThen one day, this system left me no option but to hate it and stand up in revolt against it. Mia was pregnant. She was facing a delivery situation. I rented a car to take her to hospital. We were both delighted. Everything looked fresh and new again. I hadn't yet reached the main road when two policemen stopped me. They told me that I couldn't go ahead. On my humble inquiry they told me that a member of the Politburo was to travel through this road so the passage was closed for general public. I informed them of my irresistible compulsion but they were earless. Justice is deaf in our part of the world. In response to my pleads, however, they had mercy on me enough to guide me to an alternate passage yet at the same time informed me that the road was under construction.\nI considered it a blessing and turned the vehicle towards the alternative.\nThat road was like highway to hell, There were\nmany painters who had trained for years to be able to replicate a\ntree realistically on canvas  who were dismayed at the idea that\nphotography was to be taken seriously as an art form.

Yet with\ntime, as the consternation of a new and unknown field wore of f,\nand with computers is different than it was twenty years ago.  \nThe world is now linked electronically and we have become one\naffected the fields of Cybernetics, Virtual Reality, artificial\nlife, and computer design programs.  The transformation that can\nbe seen in the Art world is astronomical and has irrevocally\nchanged the way in which society views and values visual art.  \nThe technological progression over the last hundred years have\nIt`s funny how we`re living in the past so much of the time. \nThe present, for me, has not just one finite meaning.  We all\ntradition? and a walking tour of Market Square, Fantan Alley,\nand Chinatown - but no points allowed for that one.  Eleanor\nGrant from Comox is now going up to receive a certificated for\ncontext.  Often, making THINGS interesting is part of what\neverything we construct is about.  We are here, alive, so why not\nthink about stuff & talk about stuff & write about stuff and do\nit and make it interesting while we`re here.  Enlightenment is\nboring, so balanced and harmonious and uninteresting.  There you\nhave it, the answer to IT all.  So now what, you`re alive, what\nelse is new.  Just keep on living & working or what ever I\nsuppose.  N`est-ce pas?  And change too I guess.  Throw that in\nthere as well.  Change or not comes from growth or rather can\nbe growth, and if you like expanding your mind and being lets\nsay you learn form experiences and as a result change or not\nI seem to be getting sidetracked something which I like a bit\ntoo much perhaps.  Or maybe there is just so much I want to say\nthat I get on to something else before I clearly and neatly\nfinish up with what I oh what ever.  An outline and maybe some\nmore formal structure to this speel would make it more acceptable\nat least used to looking at creativity in such a way.  Normally\nwhen ever I write it is not about things which are as of yet\nundefined.  This means that I am writing about nothing which is\nnow becoming something.  As well as controlling day to day concerns,\nthe personal computer will have capabilities of obtaining vast\namounts of information on any subject.  I can see most homes\nrunning in conjunction with the super information highways of the\nfuture.  Connection to any info library or satellite link-ups\ncould all be performed through the average home based personal\ncomputer.  The vast amounts of information that will be available\nto every person at any time may be overwhelming. It may reach the\npoint to where people will never haveThis is just how technologies and\ncultural movements are continually emerging, evolving, and being\ndefined.  I can write about what is now happening in my world, as\nfar as I know, and what I am doing within it, as a part of it so\nto speak.  Often the more one knows the more one can partake. \nBut not always.  For example, I can partake with what I know, but\nof course not everywhere, well yes everywhere.  \n\n\n\nMy chosen field is the arts.
