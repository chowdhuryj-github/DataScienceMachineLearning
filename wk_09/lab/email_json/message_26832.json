According to the package's websites [1], \nrecordmydesktop does not exist for Etch (stable). It is available in testing \nand unstable only where it depends on lib6 >= 2.3.6-6, itself available in \ntesting, and >= 2.5 in unstable. It looks like you may have made a naughty \nmess of your sources.list.\n\n[1] http://packages.debian.org\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
