Although in my case i would need to rewrite a \nlot of code. I will do it, but it will take a while to test it. I found good \ninformation on $^I at \nhttp://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq5.html#How-can-I-use-Perl%27s-%27-i%27-option-from-within-a-program%3F\n\nI found some information for seek() at \nhttp://perldoc.perl.org/functions/seek.html\n\nI tryed to use seek but it did not work. Can you help me on that, please? I \nam using Windows XP. The following example writes at the end of the file.\n\nuse strict;\nmy $file = \"teste_rw.txt\";\nopen (FILE, \"+<\", $file) or die \"Can not open $file: $!.\";\nfor my $line () {\n    print $line;\n    seek(FILE, 0, 1);\n    print FILE \"b\\n\";\n    seek(FILE, 0, 1);\n}\nmy $a_while = 2;\nsleep($a_while);\nseek(FILE, tell(FILE), 0);\nclose FILE;\n\n    Thank you.\nBruno\n\n\n\"\"Tom Phoenix\"\"  wrote in message \nnews:31086b240705141751x5cd99c4ard6e37c4abee1aed3@mail.gmail.com...\n> On 5/14/07, Bruno Schroeder  wrote:\n>\n>>     I am trying to read and write in a file, I am using something like:\n>>\n>> open (FILE, \"+\n> A little better is to include $! in the message, maybe like this:\n>\n>  open FILE, \"+    or die \"Can't open r/w 'teste_rw.txt': $!\";\n>\n>> for my $line () {\n>>  print $line;\n>>  if($line eq \"X\\n\")\n>>  {\n>>         print FILE \"b\\n\"\n>\n> Depending upon your I/O system, you may need to use seek() whenever\n> you switch from reading to writing, or from writing to reading.\n>\n> It looks as if you're trying to edit a text file \"in place\".
