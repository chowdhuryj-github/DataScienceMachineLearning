Is there an automatic way to do this Like\nfor loop 1000, try bandwidth from (0, 1). is there a function to get\nhow many modes from the density function? the Mode function in R doesnot\nseem to serve this purpose.\n\n\n Thanks\n pat\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
