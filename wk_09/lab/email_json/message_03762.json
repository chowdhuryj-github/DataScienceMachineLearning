Is \nthere/does someone know of a better \"smoking\" module to make it easily \nto test failures and if it's architecture specific, or operating system \nspecific, or both.  There's a few problems with freebsd on amd64 which \nmay largely be configuration(freebsd is amd64, not x86_64).  \nPortability on parrot is more than a problem of exported symbols at the \nmoment.  I think we've become overly accustomed to having test \nfailures, but some installer scripts won't install if there's a single \nfailure, which may be something trivial.\n\n"}
