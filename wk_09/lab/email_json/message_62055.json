What does \"which pkg-config\" give? \nWhat is PKG_CONFIG_PATH set to originally?\n\n> Another error is during the build of hulahop:\n> /home/erikos/sugar-jhbuild/build/lib/libglib-2.0.so -lxul -lpyxpcom \n> -lxpcomglue_s  -Wl,-soname -Wl,_hulahop.so -o .libs/_hulahop.so\n> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lxpcomglue_s\n> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n> make[1]: *** [_hulahop.la] Error 1\n>\n> Which package do I need to install for the shared library xpcomglue_s, \n> googled for it but could not really find out about it?\n>\n>   \n\nI checked in a fix for this yesterday night. Easier solution to avoid a \nclean rebuild is to \"cp build/lib/xulrunner-1.9a5pre/sdk/* \nbuild/lib/xulrunner-1.9a5pre\"\n\n> I am currently running Fedora6 - after the switch I guess it would be \n> recommended to switch to Fedora7?\n>\n>   \n\nFor now I'm not planning to drop \"compatibility\" with FC6. Though since \nmost developers are running F7 you might get less problem if you run on \nit...\n\nMarco\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
