Then\nin R you can source one or more of these R scripts as required, using\nthe source() function.\n\nSay you have a directory, myScripts at the base of file system\n(/home/user say on Linux or C:\\ on Windows). in this directory there is\na file called my_r_function.R. To use this script/function in an R\nsession, you would issue:\n\n## replace /home/user/ with what ever is the correct path for your\n## system\nsource(\"/home/user/myScripts/my_r_function.R\")\n\nWhich would make available to your current session any functions defined\nin my_r_function.R.\n\nRead ?source for more information.\n\nHTH\n\nG\n\n> \n> thanks, James\n> \n> \n> \n> \n>        \n> ____________________________________________________________________________________\n> \n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n-- \n%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%\n Gavin Simpson                 [t] +44 (0)20 7679 0522\n ECRC, UCL Geography,          [f] +44 (0)20 7679 0565\n Pearson Building,             [e] gavin.simpsonATNOSPAMucl.ac.uk\n Gower Street, London          [w] http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfagls/\n UK.
