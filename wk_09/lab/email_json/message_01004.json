That is in fact what I am wondering. However, an easier route\nmight be to try Rmpi with papply. Or snow (with either Rmpi or rpvm).\nOr nws (a Linda implementation for R). Using Rmpi with papply, in\nparticular, is a piece of cake with embarrasingly parallel problems.\npapply is like lapply, but parallelized, with built-in load-balancing,\nalthough it will run sequentially when no MPI universe is available;\nthe later is very handy for debugging. snow also has parallelized,\nload-balanced, versions of apply (though I do not think it\nautomatically switches to running sequentially).\n\nAll of these (Rmpi, papply, Rmpi, rpvm, nws) are R packages available\nfrom CRAN. You will need some additional stuff (LAM/MPI for Rmpi ---or\nmpich if you run windows---, PVM for rpvm, and Python and twisted for\nnws).\n\n(I asked about Rserve because the lack of fault tolerance of MPI is a\npain to deal with in my applications. Also, with LAM/MPI there are\nlimits on the number of slaves that can be handled by a lam daemon,\nand that is a problem for some of our web-based applications. Thus, I\nam looking at alternative approaches that might eliminate some of the\nextra layers that MPI ---or PVM--- add. ).\n\nHTH,\n\nR.\n\n\n> On 4/7/07, Ramon Diaz-Uriarte  wrote:\n> > Dear All,\n> >\n> > The \"clients.txt\" file of the latest Rserve package, by Simon Urbanek,\n> > says, regarding its R client,\n> >\n> > \"(...) a simple R client, i.e. it allows you to connect to Rserve from\n> > R itself.
