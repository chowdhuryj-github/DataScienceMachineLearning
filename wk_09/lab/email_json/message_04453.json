You need to download it first. You can probably do this  \nthrough the application menus. I am on a Mac, but the menus should be  \nsimilar. I have a \"Packages&Data\" menu, that has a \"Package  \nInstaller\" item.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the \"install.packages\" command I think:\ninstall.packages(\"gam\")\n\nR has a bit of a learning curve, you'll probably want to read some of  \nthe basic guides first, if you haven't yet.
