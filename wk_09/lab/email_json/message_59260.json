I guess there's something in the GPLv3 to please everyone, including\nlawyers. >:)\n\n>   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n> into a dwelling.

I don't see any reason that this should be considered\nnon-free, though I expect there'll be some debate about it on -legal.\n\n>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n>     authors of the material; or\n\n>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n>     those licensors and authors.\n\nEach of these appears to be a license term that we have accepted as free\nbefore, so there doesn't seem to be any reason to think that the\nDFSG-compliance of the GPLv3 is variable.\n\n>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n> restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.

Reading this makes me want to go write some new code,\nlicense it under the GPLv3 with some random and arbitrary prohibition, and\nwatch someone at the FSF try to argue that the additional restriction has no\nlegal force.\n\nNot non-free, just incredibly goofy; I understand the motivation, I just\ndon't see how anyone would actually think this would address the problem.\n\n>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n> rights granted or affirmed under this License.

This part\nsays that as a condition of accepting the license on a work, you may not\nassert patent rights over the work. Ok, that doesn't seem different from\nGPLv2 to me.  (Hmm, I think I need to go back and look at the APSL again, to\nunderstand how it's different from GPLv2/v3.)\n\n>   11.

Ok.\n\n>   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n> sue for patent infringement).

What does making the source code available have to\ndo with patents?  Isn't it the case that the license already requires source\ncode availability?  How does making the source code available help the\npatent problem?\n\nIs the meaning here that the Corresponding Source is only \"available\" if\nthere are no patents applying to it?  That's the only sensible meaning I can\nextract, but the license seems to go about saying this in a rather obtuse\nway.\n\nWhat does (2) really mean?  How can one \"arrange to deprive [oneself] of the\nbenefit of the patent license\" -- by goading the licensor into suing you? :)\nOtherwise, even if the patent license agreement is terminated on paper, how\ndo you force the patent holder to still treat everyone \"fairly\"?\n\nBut, ok; in spite of the above doubts, they've done a pretty good job of\nclosing the patent loophole, and done so in a way that I think is DFSG-ok.\n\n>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n> work and works based on it.\n\nOk.\n\n>   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n> specifically granted under this License.

On the one hand, it prevents\nlicensees from being able to buy patent protection on behalf of their\ncustomers, which is in many respects a useful service for vendors to be able\nto provide; on the other hand it prevents certain noteworthy software\nvendors from using their patent portfolios strategically against the Linux\ncommunity in ways that are detrimental to Free Software as a whole.\n\nAnd on the gripping hand, there's this rather unfair exception for patent\nlicensees who got in on the game early.\n\nI guess I don't see that either side of this argument is overwhelmingly\ncompelling; so I expect that this will be disputed, but accepted by the\nftpmasters.\n\n>   13.
