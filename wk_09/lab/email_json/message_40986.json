Now on the left hand frame, scroll down until you find\n\"perlmodinstall\".  That document details how to install modules, for\nvarious operating systems, including Windows.\n\nIn summary: if the module has an ActiveState distrobution, use it.\nFire up the included 'ppm' utility and just grab the module that way.\nIf not,  you'll have to get yourself a copy of 'nmake', and depending\non the module you want to install, possibly a C compiler.  More\ninformation about how and where to get these are available in that\ndocument I mentioned above.\n\nPaul Lalli\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
