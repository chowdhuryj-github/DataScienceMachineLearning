I have the gcc 3.3.6-i486-1 so I guess this \nexplains why the needed library isn't there.\n\nSo how do I find gcc-2.95 and build it without damaging my machine?  You\nmentioned a discussion on this list regarding doing that.  Where is \nthat?\n\nWould it be possible for someone just to email the library to me?  I'm \nusing the 2.6.13 kernel under Slackware 10.1.\n\nMike Keithley\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
