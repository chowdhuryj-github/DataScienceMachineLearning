If a file or directory exists in the current directory with the\nsame name as one in /usr you will get a result, otherwise there is no\nfile, so you are told false for both.  You can fix your code by either\nprefixing the file name with the directory or doing chdir() into\n$testdir.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
