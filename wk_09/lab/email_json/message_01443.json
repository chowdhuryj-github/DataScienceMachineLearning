It's now easier to deprecate\nand then remove the old double-underscore method of overriding, which\nI'll submit in a later patch.  Also:\n- make generated delegate.c smaller, refactor\n- type cleanups\n- bugfix - child class' \"init\" vtable method gets called twice when\nboth parent and child class override it\n- add test for it\n\nFiles affected:\nsrc/objects.c\nsrc/pmc/delegate.pmc\nsrc/pmc/parrotobject.pmc\nlib/Parrot/Pmc2c/delegate.pm\ninclude/parrot/objects.h\ncompilers/imcc/pbc.c\nt/pmc/object-meths.t\n\n-- \nAlek Storm\n\n"}
