Incredible opportunities can be there for you and you must be ready to grab hold of them. That's why I'm writing you now. You need to be able to identify these lucky events and take advantage of them so you can lead the life you deserve -\u2013 today!\n\nApril 27th \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My dear Memo,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several years ago, I came across an incredible kit that uses the same secret rituals and magical tools that kings, queens and others \"in the know\" have used to activate positive influences in their lives so they could attain wealth, health, power and most importantly...happiness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I call this marvelous collection of magical tools the \"Road to Riches Kit,\" and I truly believe it would be in your best interest during this time to have and use it. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upcoming weeks can have a huge impact on success and having one of these wonderful kits could just be the key you need.\u00a0\nHere's what concerns me... \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's very unusual, but every now and then I'll be doing a reading for someone when suddenly I get the strangest feeling...almost like a shock of electricity...and I know right away, that even though the person's life is about to take a major turn for the better, there's a chance that they won't know how to get the most out of all the astounding good fortune headed their way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So when I got this exact feeling tonight, as I was working on the Forecast For Health, Wealth and Happiness, I said to myself, \"you better drop everything and share your concerns with Memo.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now before I get into the details of what this \"feeling\" means, please understand I can't say precisely how it might play out in your life. Different cosmic forces present different challenges to each individual.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, judging from past experience, my best guess is, since your good fortune is so strong, if we take some prudent precautions right now absolutely nothing will go wrong. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is why I decided to write today to tell you all about the Cycle of Good Fortune and how you can best take advantage of it. That's the least I could do, considering this period could change your life.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I found out...\nThe good news is that the stars show me there is a current of positive energy coming. These energies can be so strong that they can eliminate any negative influences. I'm sure you know that there is always a certain amount of negative vibrations in the environment. You don't want it blocking some of\u00a0the benefits of the upcoming positive trends.You can put an end to all those nagging problems that have been following you for so long.  I think these worries  affected a decision you made long ago, which is tied to an event that you cannot forget or let go of. (I believe this may be at the bottom of recent emotional or health crises that could have affected your relationships or work.)\n\n\n\n\nBut don't worry, I know how we can deal with this easily. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I know you have put your trust in me so I can help you take advantage of the opportunity you've been given, and that's exactly why I'm writing to you today. Nothing would make me feel better than to see you take full advantage of the positive energy generated by your \"Cycle of Good Fortune\"!It is good to take care of this now!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is essential that you grab hold NOW of the positive influences in your environment at this moment so that you can take full advantage of your \"Cycle of Good Fortune\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what we know already... \nThis is a time when all the energies of the Universe seem to \"line up\" with your own dreams and desires, especially the ones having to do with Health, Money and Happiness. \nDuring a \"Cycle of Good Fortune,\" answers to even your worst financial problems become clear. Debts and bills get paid off almost by magic. Relationships that were strained by disagreements become happy and harmonious. Luxuries that once were far out of your reach seem to just drop into your lap. Things you gave up on long ago -- the dream house, the fabulous car, the brand-new kitchen, the collectibles or favorite \"toys\" -- suddenly become attainable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, so many amazing things can happen, you may find yourself wondering whose life you walked into, or pinching yourself to make sure you're not dreaming! \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe have to make sure absolutely nothing interferes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith your good luck.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cycle like this will make it possible for you to start concentrating on getting some of those nice things you've always wanted, things that you may have even given up dreaming about attaining. This is why it is so important we take full advantage of the positive energy surrounding you now.How to activate the positive energy around you and strengthen your will-to-win:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, I want you to have a very special gift, absolutely free of charge. It is a very powerful and magical Mandala.\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nAs you know, the Mandala has been used for centuries by mystics from the Middle East, India, Tibet and China to reach the highest states of awareness and to focus their minds on specific cosmic forces and powers. Gazing at the intricate beauty of the Mandala, you can feel your thoughts gather, your will strengthen and positive energy build all around you!\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Mandala you will receive is exactly like the one I've used myself for years, and which I'm convinced has helped make my own life so fortunate.\n\n\n\n\nAs powerful as the Mandala is, it is only the first step in turning on and building up your will-to-win, so you can truly take advantage of the benevolent energies starting to surround you now.
