HTML is a markup language with aparticular set of elements, some of which have semantic meaningattached and some of which don't.  XML, on the other hand, is a meansof writing your own markup languages; this has two consequences inthis context:\n1. It is just as easy\\u2014if not easier\\u2014to have an XML dialect containingelements with absolutely no meaning.2. Even if the dialect contains only elements with well-definedsemantics, it's still completely meaningless to a generic XML parser.A parser must be intimately familiar with the dialect to understandthat any element has semantic meaning.\nIf you were referring to XHTML vs. HTML, I would like to point outthat XHTML 1.0 is merely a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML.  Theelements and their semantics are unchanged.  XHTML 1.1 modularizes theDTD and adds a few Ruby (annotation, obviously, not language)elements, in addition to a few other minor changes.  As for XHTML 2.0,that's still a long way off. :-)-- Aankhen(We have no branches.)\n\n"}
