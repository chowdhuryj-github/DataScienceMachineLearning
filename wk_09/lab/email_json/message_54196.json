Send it to the list owner, see the headers of each list\nmessage about how to reach her.\n\nYes, other people get these annoying \"bounces\" too, and I already asked\nthe list owner at least twice to do something about it (the best way\nbeing to remove anyone related to objectorb.com from all Perl related\nmailing lists).\n\nIf more people would do that, let's hope that the list owner will act\nupon it, at last.\n\n-- \nAffijn, Ruud (administrator of many lists, but unfortunately not of this\nlist)\n\n\"Gewoon is een tijger.\"\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
