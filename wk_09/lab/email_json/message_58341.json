This would include economists, attorneys, and other non-technical professionals working in the electric power industry, as well as engineers and other technically educated personnel who are relatively new to the intricacies of the bulk electric power system. It is also useful for older hands who could benefit from a brief review.\n\u00a0\nThe Bulk Power Transmission System: How it Works and How to Make it More Reliable should be particularly relevant for market participants, since a better understanding of the transmission system and how it functions will lead to more efficient use of resources and avoidance of unnecessary costs.\n\u00a0\nThe seminar will cover the fundamental nature of electricity, why power flows the way it does, synchronous interconnections (grids), and how electric power systems really work. Topics will include voltage and current, real and reactive power, and transient stability. Reliability and its balance with economics will be discussed, along with \nTransmission Transfer Capabilities and how they are determined. Major attention will also be given to reliability standards and criteria, and the prevention of blackouts \u2013 especially within the context of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The development of the North American electric grids will be briefly described, along with the critically important roles of control areas, RTOs and ISOs, Regional Reliability Councils, NERC \u2013 and the emerging role of the ERO.\n\u00a0\nThe seminar is based on courses previously conducted for the following organizations: BC Hydro, Cegelec ESCA (Bellevue, WA), U.S. Department of Defense, FERC Staff, Florida PSC Staff, Florida Reliability Coordinating Council, ISONew England Board, Kansas City Power & Light, Oglethorpe Electric Co., Mappcor (St. Paul, MN), Mirant Corporation (Atlanta), Nebraska Society of Professional Engineers, New York State Reliability Council, New York State Public Service Commission, and ITCTransmission.\n\n\nREGISTER\n\n\n\nClick Here \n                    To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n Click Here For A Complete Listing\n                    Of Upcoming Conferences\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Conferences \n\n\n\u00a0\n  Carbon \n                            Sequestration Development & Finance Summit\n  Houston, TX\n July 11-13, 2007\n  Coal Combustion \n                            Products\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  T & D Asset \n                            Management\n  Charlotte, NC\n July 16-17, 2007\n  Wind Power \n                            Development Tutorial\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 16-18, 2007\n  FERC Electric \n                            101\n Denver, \n                            CO\n July 17-18, 2007\n  Electric Power \n                            Planning\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  NERC Reliability \n                            Standards\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 23-24, 2007\n  Project Finance \n                            Tutorial\n New \n                            York, NY\n July 23-25, 2007\n  Diversity and \n                            Inclusion- Best Practices\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-25, 2007\n  Energy \n                            Efficiency, Demand Response and Load Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 24-27, 2007\n  Revenue \n                            Management\n San \n                            Francisco, CA\n July 26-27, 2007\n  New FERC Filing \n                            and FASB Fair Valuation Standards\n  Chicago, IL\n July 30-31, 2007\n  Power Delivery \n                            Planning: Managing the Distribution Planning Process to Maximize \n                            Value\n  Chicago, IL\n Aug 1-2, 2007\n  Electric Safety \n                            in Utilities\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 15-16, 2007\n  Protective \n                            Relaying\n  Washington, DC\n Aug 16-17, 2007\n  Ancillary \n                            Services\n  Minneapolis, MN\n Sept. 10-11, 2007\n  Determining and \n                            Forecasting Load Reductions from Demand Side Programs\n  Atlanta, GA\n Sept. 10-11, 2007\n  Outage \n                            Management Systems Conference & IEEE Guide for Electric Power \n                            Distribution Reliability Indices Course\n  Atlanta, GA\n Sept. 10-12, 2007\n  Demand Response Programs From A to Z\n  Atlanta, GA\n Sept. 11-12, 2007\n  UIC2007: 4th \n                            Annual Utility Integration Conference\n  Houston, TX\n Sept. 11-12, 2007\n  Distribtution \n                            Automation (DA)\n  Minneapolis, MN\n Sept. 11-12, 2007\n  Power System \n                            Voltage Stability\n  Houston, TX\n Sept. 12-13, 2007\n  Introduction to \n                            Electric Utility Systems for Non-Engineers\n  St. Louis, MO\n Sept. 24-27, 2007\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlease forward this invitation to \n                          colleagues who may benefit from attending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPowerMarketers.com \u00b7 PO Box 2303 \u00b7 Falls Church \u00b7 VA \u00b7 22042 This email was sent to ktwarwic@speedy.uwaterloo.ca by PowerMarketers.com.Unsubscribe\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\n"}
