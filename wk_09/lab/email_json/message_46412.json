My colleague Morgan Collett (morgs on \nirc.freenode.net #sugar) is workingon a Tubes \"hello world\" example which you'll be able to use as a reference,and on improved client-side API so Tubes are easier to use.We plan to make integrity transparent - communication with the server is\ncurrently cleartext but will be SSL/TLS later, while communicationacross the mesh network is currently cleartext but will later beauthenticated and possibly signed. The signing will be donewith the \"owner key\" (a DSA keypair) which is generated when you first\nuse a new OLPC.If you want to provide integrity guarantees before we officially supportthis, you could generate your own signatures at the application leveland send them along with your messages - binary blobs (in the form of byte\narrays, signature 'ay') are fully supported by D-Bus, and hence by Tubes.Regards,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simon--Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.: http://www.collabora.co.uk/\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)Comment: OpenPGP key: http://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/2003/contact/ or \npgp.netiD8DBQFGbbiAWSc8zVUw7HYRAq96AJ9+0NheXiOgN5TSZyhbfGkGTd3V4QCgrhPGFzkSvzMCm76ktEM2MTu7gXY==YPtO-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----_______________________________________________Sugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.orghttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar-- \nRafael Enrique Ortiz Guerrero OLPC Colombiahttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Colombia\n"}
