Mainly\n\n* We landed the new Presence Service.\n* We are heavily refactoring the Graphics API and controls.\n* We started to integrate the new Data Store.\n\nAlso, not as exciting:\n\n* We are switching back to Python 2.4 in sugar-jhbuild. (It's unclear if\nfinal will actually use 2.5 as initially planned and it's really bad to\nkeep developing on 2.5 in sugar-jhbuild and build images with 2.4).\n\nAs a result we have a lot of new dependencies. Yesterday I spent some\ntime to rationalize the jhbuild modules structure. \n\nI dropped the build-base phase because it was getting too complicated to\nmaintain. jhbuild has commands to rebuild single or part of the modules\nanyway.\n\nIf you are brave enough go ahead, do a clean rebuild and let us know\nabout the problems. Most of the activities will not work because of the\nAPI changes, that's known.\n\nMarco\n\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@laptop.org\nhttp://mailman.laptop.org/mailman/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
