Besides the fact that energy theft is a crime, it also creates an undue burden for ratepayers, to whom the cost associated directly with stolen energy and associated revenue protection programs is often passed. Nationally, it is estimated that as much as $6 billion per year is lost by utilities through theft.\nThis two day EUCI Energy Theft course will offer comprehensive, yet palatable information and techniques on recognizing, investigating and recovering these types of losses in electrical systems. This course will consist of several hands-on meter exercises and direct experience case studies. \nAttendees will learn how to:\n\n\nRecognize the types of non-technical losses\n\nDetermine signs of theft\n\nEstablish a program\n\nConduct an investigation\n\nGather control evidence\n\nCalculate and collect lost revenue\n\nDocument and write energy theft reports\n\nProvide testimony in litigation and regulatory hearings\n\n\n\nWho Should Attend\n\n\nComptrollers\n\nRevenue Recovery Investigators & Supervisors\n\nMeter Test & Meter Reading Employees and Supervisors\n\nCustomer Service Supervisors\n\nAny utility employee whose responsibilities include litigation of lost revenue cases and protecting company revenues\n\nRegulators\n\nCost of Service and Rate Design Staff\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRegister today!\n\n\n\n\nClick\n        Here To Download A Complete Conference Brochure\n\n\n\nUpcoming \nConferences\n\nPower Delivery \n  Planning I: Getting The Basics Right\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Outsourcing \n  For Utilities\nChicago, IL\n  April 17-18, 2007\n  Marketing \n  Green Power\nChicago, IL\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Fundamentals \n  of Distribution Engineering\nAtlanta, GA\n  April 19-20, 2007\n  Sox-101 for \n  Electric, Gas and Water Utilities ...
