Thompson of Tennessee has taken new steps that\nmake it clear that he is likely to run for the White House,\npotentially shaking up a field of candidates that has failed to\nstrike a chord with the Republican base. Mr. Thompson is\ncreating a committee that will let him begin raising money on\nMonday toward a full-blown national campaign, advisers said\nWednesday. They hope his name recognition as an actor and radio\ncommentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and\ngovernment spending, and strength in the South will\ndifferentiate him from the current crop of candidates. The\ndisclosure of his intensifying activities sent ripples through\nthe party, with the campaigns of two of the main Republican\ncandidates checking with their deputies in Iowa and New\nHampshire to monitor any hiring or fund-raising efforts by Mr.\nThompson, 64. New York Times: Stir in GOP as ex-senator move to\nrun\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/us/politics/31thompson.html\n\nTHOMPSON COULD BE FORCED ONTO IOWA STRAW\nPOLL:  Whether he wants to be or not, former Sen. Fred Thompson\nwill probably be on the ballot when thousands of Iowa\nRepublicans meet on Aug. 11 at the Ames straw poll. After\nmonths of speculation that the \"Law & Order\" star would leap\ninto the crowded race for the Republican nomination for\npresident, aides let the cat out of the bag on Wednesday,\nsaying Thompson was likely to declare his intentions in early\nJuly. But that does not automatically mean he will participate\nin the much-hyped event. The Politico: Iowa GOP could force\nFred onto straw poll.\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4252.html\n\nWILL THOMPSON COMPETE IN IOWA? Former Tennessee\nSen. Fred Thompson is expected to take steps toward a\nRepublican presidential campaign, but is unsure to what extent\nhe will compete in Iowa. Thompson, who is expected to form a\ngroup this week to allow him to test the waters, has signaled\nGOP officials in Iowa that he would campaign for the caucuses.\n\"Fred Thompson is taking all the necessary steps to come to his\nfinal decision,\" Thompson spokesman Mark Corallo told The Des\nMoines Register. \"Stay tuned.\" Des Moines Register: Thompson\nreaches out to Iowa GOP\nhttp://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070530/-NEWS/70530012/1001\n\nTHOMPSON SET\nTO RUN AGAINST AN OLD FRIEND: He endorsed Sen. John McCain's\n2000 insurgent campaign for president, at the time saying the\nArizona Republican \"has shown characteristics of leadership\nlike nobody I've ever seen.\" After that election, he was a key\nGOP ally in the 2002 passage of McCain's signature\ncampaign-finance-reform legislation. But now former Sen. Fred\nThompson, R-Tenn., has become the latest challenge to McCain's\n2008 White House hopes. The Law & Order actor plans to\nofficially enter the Republican presidential race in July,\naccording to news reports. \"Fred's a very good friend,\" McCain\nsaid Wednesday in Phoenix. \"I guess my words are, 'Come on in,\nthe water's fine.'\" Arizona Republic: One-time ally set to\ncompete vs. McCain\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0531thompson-mccain0531.html\n\nBUSH REACHES OUT TO PUTIN:\nPresident Bush yesterday launched a high-stakes effort to\nrepair the dramatically deteriorating U.S. relationship with\nRussia by inviting President Vladimir Putin to visit the family\ncompound in Kennebunkport, Maine, after weeks of rhetoric\nreminiscent of the Cold War. The White House has grown\nincreasingly alarmed lately with the harsh tone coming out of\nMoscow and its hardening positions on issues that include\nIran's nuclear program, Kosovo statehood and missile defense.\nAdministration officials said privately that the situation has\nreached a crisis stage and needs to be reversed before it gets\nworse. Although the president's aides do not expect to resolve\nthe stickiest issues dividing the two sides during the visit to\nthe Bush family retreat on the rocky Maine coast July 1-2, they\nhope the relaxed setting will restore U.S.-Russian relations to\na more constructive footing.

Zoellick, freshly anointed by President\nBush as his choice to lead the World Bank, yesterday spoke in\nconciliatory tones about healing the rifts left from the tenure\nof the previous appointee, Paul D. Wolfowitz. \"The World Bank\nhas passed through a difficult time for all involved,\" Zoellick\nsaid at a morning announcement at the White House. \"There are\nfrustrations, anxieties, and tensions about the past that could\ninhibit the future. This is understandable but not without\nremedy. We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to\nfocus on the future together.\" Zoellick, a former U.S. trade\nrepresentative and deputy secretary of state, said he would\nspend the coming weeks sounding out bank staff, development\nexperts and governments around the world on what the World Bank\nshould focus on, while courting support.

The high-profile endorsement is a boon to the\nformer mayor, whose views on security and terrorism can only\nbenefit from having an international lawman like Freeh in his\ncorner, experts said. \"Any endorsement that lets Rudy talk\nabout fighting crime and terrorism is good for him,\" said GOP\nconsultant Dan Schnur. \"And if Giuliani and [Hillary] Clinton\nare the nominees, you can be sure that Louis Freeh ends up in\nthe front row of every debate, just to try and knock her off\nher game.\" New York Daily News: Ex-Clinton FBI chief pushing\nPrez Rudy\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/2007/05/31/2007-05-31_exclinton_fbi_chief_pushing_prez_rudy-1.html\n\nOBAMA, ROMNEY OFFER SHARP CONTRASTS ON IRAQ:\nDemocratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican\ncandidate Mitt Romney outline their respective foreign policy\nvisions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign\nAffairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including\nthe war in Iraq and climate change. Obama calls the Bush\nadministration's Iraq policies \"tragically misguided\" and\nadvocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be\ncompleted by next March. Romney notes that there is \"no\nguarantee\" that the administration's current strategy will\nsucceed but says that \"the stakes are too high and the\npotential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and\ntroops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give\nit an opportunity.\" Washington Post: Obama and Romney lay out\npositions on Iraq and beyond\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/30/AR2007053002302.html\n\nBROWNBACK ON\nEVOLUTION: In our sound-bite political culture, it is\nunrealistic to expect that every complicated issue will be\naddressed with the nuance or subtlety it deserves. So I suppose\nI should not have been surprised earlier this month when,\nduring the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates\non stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not\n\"believe\" in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I\nthink it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more\ndetail and with the seriousness it demands.  The premise behind\nthe question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly\nassert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe\nthat God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour\ndays. But limiting this question to a stark choice between\nevolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity\nof the interaction between science, faith and reason. New York\nTimes Op-Ed: What I think about Evolution\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31brownback.html\n\nDEMS CAUSING MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE GRANITE\nSTATE: Democratic presidential candidates are drawing bigger\ncrowds, more donors, and more energy from the New Hampshire\nelectorate than Republican hopefuls are, a sign to officials in\nboth parties of a lack of enthusiasm for the current GOP field\nand a tired state Republican Party still reeling from a\nhistoric defeat in November. New Hampshire Republicans, who\nlost control of both chambers of the state Legislature and both\nUS House seats last fall, are showing only moderate interest in\nthe 10 GOP presidential candidates who have trooped to their\nstate. Democratic candidates for the 2008 nomination,\nmeanwhile, have had to issue tickets to campaign events to\naccommodate large crowds, and are already conducting statewide\ncanvassing efforts usually unheard of at this early stage of\nthe campaign. Average donations to Democratic contenders from\nNew Hampshire residents are also higher and more numerous,\naccording to campaign finance records.

In a potential\npreview of next fall's presidential contest, Mr. Giuliani, who\nis seen as the front-runner for the Republican nomination,\ndirectly attacked the leading Democratic candidate, Mrs.\nClinton, over a speech she gave Tuesday in New Hampshire\nbemoaning the return of \"robber barons\" and promising to pursue\n\"shared prosperity\" by increasing taxes on Americans making\nmore than $200,000 a year. New York Sun: Giuliani lashes into\nClinton over 'staggering' tax hike\nhttp://www.nysun.com/article/55535\n\nCLINTON: JET TRAVEL COMPLIED WITH SENATE RULES: Sen.\nHillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she followed all\nSenate rules when she accepted rides on a private jet from a\nlongtime benefactor. \"Whatever I've done, I complied with\nSenate rules at the time. That's the way every senator\noperates,\" the Democratic presidential contender said in an\ninterview with The Associated Press during a campaign stop in\nLas Vegas. Clinton's travel, along with and consulting fees\npaid to her husband, the former president, have come to light\nrecently in a lawsuit against Vinod Gupta, a Clinton\ncontributor and chief executive of the data company, InfoUSA\nInc.

Clinton defends private jet travel\nhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070531/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_iraq\n\nAL NOT THE ONLY GORE MAKING MONEY: Looks\nlike former Vice President Al Gore -- and the will he? Won't\nhe? run for president game -- isn't the only Gore family member\ngenerating excitement these days. His wife, Tipper, is creating\nquite a buzz herself on 14th Street. The Mitchell Gold + Bob\nWilliams furniture store, which opened in late April, sells\nprints of some of Tipper's photography. (She's been shooting\nsince the 1970s and even put out a book of photographs in 1996\ntitled, \"Picture This.\") Turns out, they've already sold four,\nincluding \"Pyramids in Egypt\" and \"Shanghai Scene.\" And that's\nno small feat, considering that it'll run you anywhere from\n$750 to $2,950 to walk out of the store with a Tipper photo\nunder your arm.
