I didn't add it to the harness.\n\nHrm, just did some investigation and realised that all tests under\nt/doc are added; sorry for the extra unwanted output.  This was a wee\ntest file that I was wanting to do some work on and most certainly\ndidn't want everyone to run straight away.  I'll skip it for the time\nbeing so that it doesn't disturb people.\n\nPaul\n\n"}
