Perhaps you want to use a global flag\nin your program; that's a simple solution. Or your error handler could\nsimply output the header in any case, since it's an error message\nanyway.\n\nMy preferred solution is to use an eval block that returns (rather\nthan outputting) a complete web page. If everything worked, it's\nsimple to output the page; otherwise, it's equally simple to output an\nerror page. In either case, there's no worry about the headers until\noutput time.\n\nIs that what you needed?\n\n--Tom Phoenix\nStonehenge Perl Training\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
