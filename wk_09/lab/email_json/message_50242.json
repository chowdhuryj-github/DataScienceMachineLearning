You can test it if you will have the\nother console and there you do killall modprobe, then do modprobe\nspeakup_softsyn again, I think that will works. If yes, you can use the\nscript which I sent here in one of previous email.\n\nHave a nice day\n\n-- \n\nJan Buchal\nTel: (00420) 24 24 86 008\nMob: (00420) 608023021\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
