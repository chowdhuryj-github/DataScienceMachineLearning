It is the quote regex operator.\n\nfrom perldoc perlop\n       qr/STRING/imosx\n               This operator quotes (and possibly compiles) its STRING as a\n               regular expression.  STRING is interpolated the same way as\n               PATTERN in \"m/PATTERN/\".  If \"'\" is used as the delimiter, no\n               interpolation is done.  Returns a Perl value which may be used\n               instead of the corresponding \"/STRING/imosx\" expression.\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
