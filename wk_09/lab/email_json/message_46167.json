We're using\nD-Bus as the basis for most OLPC things - is there a compelling reason\nnot to here?\n\nIn the Telepathy-based collaboration framework Collabora are developing for\nthe OLPC (including the Presence Service), activities are shared over\n\"tubes\". These can currently transport a distributed D-Bus over reliable\nstreams, with work in progress to do TCP-like reliable streams between\npeers too. Transporting UDP-like datagrams over tubes, using ICE or\nJingle for NAT traversal, is a future enhancement.\n\nThe advantage of using Tubes is that we're already thinking about issues\nwhich prevent peer-to-peer networks from working in practice, mainly NAT\ntraversal. Tubes provide a consistent API which will remain consistent\nand transparent as we add additional NAT traversal methods and transport\nmechanisms; the API is also consistent between the server-based and\nlink-local collaboration, and any future collaboration mechanisms. We will\nalso transport instant messages related to an activity, and the necessary\nmetadata to support the Buddy- and Activity-centric programming model used\nin Sugar.\n\nI've only looked at the OSC spec briefly, but you seem to be assuming\nsynchronized real-time clocks. Is this a requirement we can impose on XOs?\nIf it *is*, we could use it for the link-local communication to provide\nadditional ordering guarantees; but I suspect it isn't something we can\nassume.\n\n\tSimon\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: OpenPGP key: http://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/2003/contact/ or pgp.net\n\niD8DBQFGbVdNWSc8zVUw7HYRAu7oAKCmdM+17egxOXKQpf/GgQZcIbwD2QCeKvWt\nOk1jeRmNP2AKcRC8okmopBI=\n=ATo2\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n_______________________________________________\nSugar mailing list\nSugar@lists.laptop.org\nhttp://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/sugar\n\n"}
