I want to express my utter dismay at the way this officer handled the situation. \u00a0 I live in Florida and this \"power trip\" mentality displayed by this officer was responsible for the death of a 14 year old named boy Martin Lee Anderson. He was\u00a0beaten to death by the \"Boot Camp Guards.\"\u00a0This was caught on video for all Floridians as well as all of the nation to see. \u00a0 I believe in law and order and I understand the concept of public safety. I did not see anything this boy did that\n would provoke such a heavy handed response from an officer. \u00a0 In the ranks of the police and in the ranks of prison guards, their are some that are attracted to these positions because they particularly enjoy the POWER to control, brutalize, attack, and abuse people. I do not know your hiring practices and what role psychological screening plays in the hiring of police officers.\u00a0I believe that law enforcement and all\u00a0\"corrections\" HR have a public duty to\u00a0screen out these personality types. This would prevent tragic deaths (like Martin Lee Anderson) and enhance public safety. How do you\u00a0think these kids perceive law enforcement after witnessing this arrest? \u00a0 Unless I am uninformed, we are not\u00a0YET living in a police state. Law Enforcement has the responsibility to \"serve and protect\" but in a manner that is respectful and does not use more force than is required\u00a0in any\n given\u00a0situation.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0 \u00a0 Chrystal Weaver \u00a0 \u00a0"}
