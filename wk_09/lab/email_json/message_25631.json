You could have tried it easily \nfor yourself by slightly modifying the example on the help page of \n'survdiff'.\n\nlibrary(survival)\nsurvdiff(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ rx,data=ovarian)\nsurvdiff(Surv(futime, 1-fustat) ~ rx,data=ovarian)\n\n\nIf you want to work more in survival analysis, I can recommend the book \nJohn P. Klein / Melvin L. Moeschberger (2003): Survival Analysis. \nTechniques for Censored and Truncated Data. Springer. (but it gives no \nrecipes in R).\n\nHope this helps,\nRoland\n\n\nraymond chiruka wrote:\n> in R when carring out the log rank test is the censored variable denoted by 1 or 0 or its of no consequence.\n>   \n>   thanks\n>   \n>  \n> ---------------------------------\n> \n> always stay connected to friends.\n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n>\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
