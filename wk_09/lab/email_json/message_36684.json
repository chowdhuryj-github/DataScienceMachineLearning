X just doesn't\nstart at the login, with various error messages.\n\nI'm so desperate that I even consider to recompile the xserver-xorg\npackage and configure it without dri. However I didn't figure out how to\ndo that. I got the source with\n    apt-get source xserver-xorg\nand am stuck here.\n\nHow do I configure the build of this module?\nIs there any other way of fixing this problem?\n\nI don't need dri, I don't even need glx, I just want to have X running\nat the login prompt.\nAny hint is welcome.\nThanks in advance,\n\n    G.
