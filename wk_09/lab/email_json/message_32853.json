You may create and reproduce Derivative Works, provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0 1.the Derivative Work(s) constitute a good-faith partial or recombined usage employing \"sampling,\" \"collage,\" \"mash-up,\" or other comparable artistic technique, whether now known or hereafter devised, that is highly transformative of the original, as appropriate to the medium, genre, and market niche; and\n\u00a0\u00a0 2.Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of the original Work, or if You choose to use the original Work as a whole, You must either use the Work as an insubstantial portion of Your Derivative Work(s) or transform it into something substantially different from the original Work. In the case of a musical Work and/or audio recording, the mere synchronization (\"synching\") of the Work with a moving image shall not be considered a transformation of the Work into something substantially different.\nGreetings and thanks,Miry\n"}
