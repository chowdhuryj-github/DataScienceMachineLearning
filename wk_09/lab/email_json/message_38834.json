I could use gray, but I would prefer colour.  So,\nquestions:\n\n1) is there any set of options I can use which will actually let me\ncreate that many colours?\n2) if not, how do I test if there is not, and implement gray instead of\ncolours?  This function and package works on windows, and it works with\nless colours.  I guess I could try and trap the error, and if I can, go\nback and re-run the function with \"options(X11colortype=\"gray\")\" but I'd\nprefer something more elegant... What I'm looking for is some test where\nI can say \"If you're going to fail, X11colortype='gray', else\nX11colortype='true'\".  Possible?\n\nMany thanks\nMick\n\nThe information contained in this message may be confidentia...{{dropped}}\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
