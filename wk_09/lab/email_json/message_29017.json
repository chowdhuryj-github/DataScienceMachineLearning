Actually, I first wrote Mark, but\nhe had a vacation mail message saying he'll be away until the 22nd, and\nI wanted my students to be able to use this debugging tool before then.\n\nR-2.5.0-patched did indeed solve the problem.  Thanks.\n\nBy the way, I have (yet another) R tutorial/reference page, at\nhttp://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/r.html \n\nNorm Matloff\nDept. of Computer Science (formerly in the Dept. of Statistics)\nUniversity of California, Davis\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
