Do you want to click\non the plot to see an update?  Or just moving the mouse over the plot\nwithout clicking would update the line?).\n\nIf you don't mind clicking on the plot, here is a quick example of what\nyou could do (put in your own function and numbers):\n\nlibrary(TeachingDemos)\n\nmyfun <- function(x)  sqrt(x)\n\ncurve( myfun, 0, 10 )\n\ntmp <- cnvrt.coords(0,0, input='plt')$usr\ntmp2 <- cnvrt.coords(-0.05, -0.05, input='plt')$usr\n\npar(xpd=TRUE)\n\nwhile( length(myx <- locator(1)$x) ){\n\tmyy <- myfun(myx)\n\tcurve( myfun, 0, 10 )\n\tlines( c(myx,myx,tmp$x), c(tmp$y, myy, myy), col='green' )\n\ttext( c( myx, tmp2$x ), c(tmp2$y, myy), round(c( myx, myy ), 2),\ncol='red')\n}\n\n\nIf you run the above code it will create the plot, then wait for you to\nclick on the plot, when you click it will draw the lines corresponding\nto the x location of your click and put labels in the margins, clicking\nagain will move the lines and update the labels.  Right click and select\n'stop' when you are through.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
