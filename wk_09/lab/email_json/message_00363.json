The math for such an invisibility effect was worked out\nlast year at Duke and in the UK, but the new work, to be published in\nNature Photonics this month, is the first practical design. The lead\nresearcher, Vladimir Shalaev, notes that even though the current design\nworks only at a single wavelength, and so would not convey true\ninvisibility, it could still be useful \\u2014 against, for example,\nnight-vision goggles or laser target designators. Shalaev calls the\ntechnical challenge of producing an all-wavelengths cloak \"doable in\nprinciple.\"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/07/217242\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Engineers_Create_Optical_Cloaking_Design_For_Invisibility_999.html\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Two Major Debian Releases In One Day                               |\n|   from the busy-busy dept.                                         |\n|   posted by kdawson on Sunday April 08, @02:19 (Debian)            |\n|   http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/08/017241         |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]AndyCater writes \"If all goes according to plan, Debian should release\nboth an update to Debian Sarge (3.1r6, henceforth to be oldstable) and a\nnew stable release (Debian 4.0, which was codenamed Etch) \\u2014 and announce\nthe results of the election for Debian Project Leader \\u2014 all within 12\nhours.

The systems have been tested\non a small number of users. Currently the devices that interpret the\n\"force fields\" for sight-impaired users are not portable, and so the\nsystems are most appropriate for doing research before, e.g., visiting a\nnew city.\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=07/04/07/2143222\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.primidi.com/\n    1. http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=BDC29B20-E7F2-99DF-3C6EC4B5008F1FE9&chanID=sa003\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Microsoft Opposing California Open Doc Bill                        |\n|   from the write-fax-or-email dept.                                |\n|   posted by kdawson on Sunday April 08, @08:02 (Microsoft)         |\n|   http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/08/0117250     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[0]ZJMX writes \"Microsoft is going through its email and phone lists\nasking people to [1]support their opposition to California A.B. 1668 \\u2014\n'Open Document Format, Open Source' \\u2014 by writing to the California\nAssemblymen involved in this bill (contact info in the link).
