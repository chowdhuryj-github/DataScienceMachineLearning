(I think that some colo-facilities work like \nthis, and know that some hosting services work like this.)\n\nI'm not really to concerned with people running modified GPL'ed programs on \nthird party grid services,\nas they could in theory do the same thing with an internal grid service if \nthey had one. Ideally\nthey would release any useful changes anyway. If not it still does not seem \nlike too big a deal (to me).\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
