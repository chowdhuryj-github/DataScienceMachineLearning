I want to try to construct\nthe arguments for GetOptions, but in a dynamic way. So, instead of\nhard-coding my switches, like this:\nGetOptions (\n       showlog       => \\$MyArgs{showlog},\n       'strategy=s'  => \\$MyArgs{strategy}\n)\n\nlike is shown in the GetOptions documentation page, I would like to\nfeed the list based upon some arrays (@GlobalSwitches, @LocalSwitches,\nand @OptionList). I like using the %MyArgs{option} approach because\nthen I wouldn't have to declare a variable for each option I may have.\nHaving said that.. I'm not sure how I could do as you suggest.. How\nwould I set $target_hash_ref to support say the \"showlog\" switch, and\nthe \"strategy\" option? Would I be able to refer to each option such as\n$target_hash_ref{showlog}, or $target_hash_ref{strategy} ?\nThanks alot for your help\nRay\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
