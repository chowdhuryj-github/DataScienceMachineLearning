Utah won the Northwest Division title this season, but is learning the playoff game on the fly.\n\nThe Warriors had another golden mass of fans \u2014 but the Jazz had more brass.\n\n\"That was a big step in the growth process for us as a team,\" said Fisher, who missed the series opener and dramatically returned during Game 2 after tending to his daughter's serious health problem.\n\n\"It was like we knew what to expect. It was a great atmosphere to play in, but we handled it like pros.\"\n\nWith a poised, gritty performance that should have made the former Jazz greats proud, Utah earned the chance to clinch its first trip to the conference finals since 1998 with a victory at home in Game 5 on Tuesday night, ending the Warriors' improbable run of playoff excitement.\n\nDeron Williams had 20 points and 13 assists as the Jazz finally solved the riddle of Oracle Arena, where the underdog Warriors won their first four playoff home games with uptempo offense and fan support that dazzled the nation.\n\nBut with a Jerry Sloan game plan that hearkened back to those bruising days when Karl Malone and John Stockton ruled the West, Utah simply bullied Golden State.\n\n\"We're doing better staying with what they're trying to take away from us,\" Sloan said. \"Our team hasn't had to make these adjustments, but our guys are getting better and better.\"\n\nAl Harrington scored 24 points before fouling out, but Baron Davis had just 15 points and seven assists. The Warriors were a dissonant mess through most of their first home loss in 10 games dating to the regular season \u2014 yet they still held a lead in the final minutes before Utah's superior poise won it again.\n\nSleepy Floyd had his 51-point playoff game for the Warriors against the        Los Angeles Lakers on Mother's Day 20 years ago, but Davis had no such heroics left. The Warriors' leader went 6-for-16, including 2-of-8 on 3-pointers.\n\n--!>\nVisit here to get enrolled for your Interior Design degree!        \n\n\n\n"}
