I am wanting to play around with the cd based \nfirewall, devil-linux and am wondering what it would take, and, how \nhard it would be to have speakup support for it. I have asked on the \ndl mailing list about doing a headless install, so I wont have to \nworrie with speakup, but, don't seem that many people know if a \nheadless install can be done. If anyone has ever done anything with \nit and has any ideas, that would be great. I figured that google \nwould know, but, I did not find much there either.\nThanks.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
