I\nuse this when doing an R demonstration (teaching), so that the students\ncan have a transcript that shows the commands I typed along with their\noutput (including the graphs).  \n\nAnother approach is the odfWeave package.  This is similar to sweave,\nexcept that you use openoffice writer (can read MSWord docs) to set up\nthe text and set of commands (less overhead/startup than LaTeX).\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-- \nGregory (Greg) L.
