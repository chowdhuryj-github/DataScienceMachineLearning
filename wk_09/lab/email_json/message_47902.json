If you know of any, of course I would be happy to read them.\n\nThere's an excellent non-R discussion of a wide range of ordination methods\nat http://ordination.okstate.edu/ (Mike Palmer's work).\n\nIf you look under \"distance-based ordination\" (like MDS/PCO),\nyou find:\n\"Special case: for Euclidean distance, PCoA = PCA.\"\n\nand much other useful information. He also gives an extensive list of\nreferences from the literature, if you'd like something more rigorous.\nFor an overview text, I'm partial to _Numerical Ecology_ by Legendre\nand Legendre (1998) because of its readability, but there are many\nmore good texts.\n\nSarah\n-- \nSarah Goslee\nhttp://www.functionaldiversity.org\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
