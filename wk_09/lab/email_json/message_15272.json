So far the UK distributors of the focus have let me down twice over an arranged demo.  The Royal National Institute of the Blind wanted me to purchase a display from Humanware but I don't think that is supported.  I can't seem to see the info on their displays from their website, wasn't it called the Braillet?\n\nAny pointers to a more appropriate list or experiences of display users will be appreciated.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nBTW:  The Humanware.ca site is falsely displaying the WC3 validation icon but the product page had 5 errors.\n\nGena\n\nAmateur Call: M 0 E B P\n\nVOIP / IM: gena1959uk\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
