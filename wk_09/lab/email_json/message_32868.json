We prove that \"generic\" doesn't necessarily mean \"expensive\". If you shop for drugs online, please, read this to the end.\nEveryone knows that drug sale taxes are much lower in Canada than in the USA that's why many Americans choose to purchase their medications at CanadianPharmacy. A much lower price for drugs of the same generic quality that's what CanadianPharmacy has to offer you.\nCanadianPharmacy turn Canadian drug sales taxation system to your advantage.\nSincerely yours,Augusta Jeffers\n\n\n\n\n"}
