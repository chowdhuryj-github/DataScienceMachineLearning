Just sign up once and you will be set to go. The next time you log in after setup, it will be business as usual!\nThe new technology identifies you as the true \"owner\" of your account(s) by recognizing your PASSWORD and your COMPUTER. If the computer you are using is not recognized by us because you have logged in from a public computer or one you haven't used before-you will be asked \"challenge questions\". These questions require simple answers that are personal and only you would know the answers. This is all done as an additional line of defense to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nTo  sign up Washington State Employees Credit Union  \"challenge questions\" please click the link below.\n\nhttps://hb.wsecu.org/wsecuhb/hbnet/login/login.aspx?organization=EE423A1F-8F8F-49a9-859E-1AFB45E62012\n\nWashington State Employees Credit Union is committed to fraud prevention\\u2026. everyday and everywhere!
