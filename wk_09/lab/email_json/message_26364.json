After grepping out the correct lines we use strapply\nto find and emit character sequences that come after a \"(\" but do not contain\na \")\" .  back = -1 says to only emit the backreferences and not the entire\nmatched expression (which would have included the leading \"(\" ):\n\nURL <- \"http://www.snamretegas.it/italiano/business/gas/bilancio/pdf/bilancio.pdf\"\nLines.raw <- readLines(URL)\nLines <- grep(\"Industriale|Termoelettrico\", Lines.raw, value = TRUE)\nlibrary(gsubfn)\nstrapply(Lines, \"[(]([^)]*)\", back = -1, simplify = rbind)\n\nwhich gives a character matrix whose first column is the label\nand second column is the number in character form.
