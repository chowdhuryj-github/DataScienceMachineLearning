Maybe I can tag onto Roland's question and ask for hints\non what configuration options are available?\n\nThanks,\n\nRoger\n\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch\n[mailto:r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch] On Behalf Of Chuck Cleland\nSent: Wednesday, May 16, 2007 1:08 PM\nTo: Roland Rau\nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSubject: Re: [R] read.table opening a website incl Password\n\nRoland Rau wrote:\n> Dear all,\n> \n> in the past I have been able to access websites with data directly. \n> For example the following code works nicely\n> \n> mydata <- \n> read.table(\"http://www.lifetable.de/data/MPIDR/POL_2004.txt\",\nheader=TRUE)\n> \n> But what happens if I need a username and password (a different site)?\n\n> How do I do that?
