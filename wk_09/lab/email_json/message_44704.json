Suppose we have a regression\nproblem containing 25 predictor variables of 1000 individuals. I want to\ndivide the data matrix ( 1000 x 25 ) into two partitions for training (70%)\nand testing(30%). For this reason, i sample 70% of data into another\ntraining matrix and remaining 30% into testing matrix using pseudorandom\nnumbers (for future analysis).\n\nI need some efficient solution so that we can generate both matrix with\nminimal time. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSabyasachi\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/How-to-partition-sample-space-tf3888059.html#a11021390\nSent from the R help mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
