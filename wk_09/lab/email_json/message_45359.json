The FBI is also adding to its more than 180 Safe Streets Task Forces by sending one to Orlando, which Gonzales said has been plagued by gang violence.\n\nOrlando police spokeswoman Barbara Jones said the department \"welcomes any additional federal support in our efforts to combat violent crime.\"\n\nNo additional funds or grants are expected to be funneled to communities to bolster their own law enforcement efforts, Justice officials said. Gonzales also called anew for new laws to strengthen penalties against criminals, including imposing mandatory minimum sentences on federal convicts.\n\n--!>   This advertisement is brought to you by Experience Sunset Resorts.
