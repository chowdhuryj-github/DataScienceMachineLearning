They are not secure, period. Many sites will not\nwork properly with browsers like links even though they have\njavascript support. \n\nThe adobe situation is far worse. It is becoming an entirely \ndifferent platform on its own. Its almost like windows, in fact\nit is competition to windows, it's a challenge to own desktop.\nLook what google does, it can convert pdf to html but NOT \ntext, its graphical. Its a total mess. It's huge software and is\nbuggy.\n\nI could go on and on about these three evil bits of software.\n\nBut fundamentally they all assume I am on a PC, also on \nwindows, and desktop windows. This is not my idea of \ninformation being free. The future does not lie in PCs. It \nwill be portable devices. None of them handle these types\nof \"pages\" properly. Web sites should be standardized in \nsuch a way that they are not form fit for PCs. There are \nsome that support mini version pages like WAP format\nbut that's pretty lame. The information should be just \ninformation, and the protocols should be standard and \ngeneric such that ANY device or process can read them\nand re-format them any way necessary. This will never \nhappen with javascript, flash, or pdf.\n\nAll of the above are really used because of the silly need\nto make the web more like TV than information, with \nall kinds of dizzying adverts, and the use of them is usually \nONLY to make the site look pretty. Wrong reasons to \ndiverge from the original idea, that there should be a set\nof standards that are globally accessible.\n\nI believe in accessibility beyond just for what most \npeople think, it should allow not only different devices\nor browsers, it shoul allow different modalities. The \nCONTROLS in particular should not assume that \nthere is keyboard and mouse. Some very serious work\nneeds to be done in accessibility standards, and it's \nnot headed in the right direction.\n\n  -- Spie\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
