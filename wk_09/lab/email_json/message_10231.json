Anysuggestions are welcome. I am using Ubuntu Linux and here is what I did:\n$ sudo R Then once in R, I did\n> install.packages(\"tseries\", dep=TRUE)\nwhich gave a long list of errors. Going through them, I saw that thebasic problem was that the package \"grid\" was not found by the packages(like \"lattice\", \"Hmisc\", etc.) that were part of the dependencies for\"tseries\". So, I tried installing the package \"grid\" but could not. Hereis what I did (and the result):\n$ sudo R\nOnce in R, I did\n> install.packages(\"grid\", dep=TRUE)\nAnd this is what I got as error message\nWarning in install.packages(\"grid\", dep = TRUE) :         argument 'lib' is missing: using /usr/local/lib/R/site-library--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... donedependency '\\u2018grid\\u2019' is not available\nHow should I proceed?\nDeepankar\n______________________________________________R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing listhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-helpPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.htmland provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
