Packages should not refer to GPL and LGPL symlinks in\n+         that directory since different, incompatible versions of these\n+         licenses have been published by the Free Software Foundation,\n+         hence using the symlinks could lead to ambiguity.\n\nI disagree with this. It should be ok to point to the latest version\nof the GPL if the program says \"Version X or later\". Many programs\ndo that, and we should not need to change them.\n\nInstead, I think we should amend policy in this way:\n\n  Packages under a fixed, definite version of the GPL should refer to\n  the versioned GPL file in /usr/share/common-licenses.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
