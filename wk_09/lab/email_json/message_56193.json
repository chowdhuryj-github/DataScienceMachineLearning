Where?  *It's a mailing\nlist.*  It doesn't get pissed off, it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get\nsad, it doesn't laugh at your jokes... it just resends emails!\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, -legal didn't attack aj for making not much\nprogress on the debian trademark as DPL, or for the SPI board he advised\nfailing to consider the trademark policies its trademark committee\ndrafted.  I did, and I give my opinion only, as mentioned in almost every\nsig and web site I post.\n\nI think the Anthony Towns DPLship was not a fun time for those trying\nto fix legal bugs and it should have been ended sooner.  The most\nsignificant progress seemed to be the delegation of trademark and\ncopyright instruction to Branden Robinson (which I linked in the summary),\nbut then those things seemed to return to DPL control again somehow.\nHas the delegation ended or what?\n\nProbably the simplest way forwards is to post the four policies drafted\nso far, then choose between them, with any minor amendments.  I'll check\nwhether I can make the fourth one public and then do that.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nMJR/slef\nMy Opinion Only: see http://people.debian.org/~mjr/\nPlease follow http://www.uk.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
