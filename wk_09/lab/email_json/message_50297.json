In addition to phosphorylation sites curated from the literature, large numbers of new unpublished sites discovered by MS/MS analyses are being added regularly. This unpublished information is added in order to rapidly disseminate information about the large numbers of new phosphorylation sites being discovered by scientists at Cell Signaling Technology and other institutions. Unpublised sites must meet rigorous quality standards before being curated into PhosphoSite.Visit PhosphoSite now.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n Pathways in Human Cancer PosterCell Signaling Technology's latest poster is a companion piece to the textbook The Biology of Cancer by Dr. Robert A. Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.Email us to request your poster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinase-Disease AssociationsAs key regulators of most cellular pathways, protein kinases are frequently associated with disease, as causative agents or points of therapeutic intervention. CST have summarised the disease associations for over 150 kinases, including the molecular basis of the association and relevant Medline and OMIM links.Availalbe on the web or email us for a printed copy.\n\n\n\n\n\n Reference GuideCST's catalog contains extensive technical information on signal transduction, but would you like the critical information in one handy guide?The Cell Signaling Technology Reference Guide is a booklet including the kinase disease associations table, detailed diagrams of the human kinome, a summary of human oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, and more than 30 signal transduction pathway diagrams.Email us for your copy of the Reference Guide. \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody Validation TablesEach activation-state antibody entry in CST's catalog includes which technologies the antibody is validated for. But CST also provide a handy printed set of Antibody Validation Tables listing comparative species reactivity and technology validation (WB, IP, Imunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence) for their antibodies in the classes of Akt, Caspase-3, p44/42 MAPK Kinase, p38 MAP Kinase, SAPK/JNK, Stat3 and CREB.Email us to request your copy of the validation tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n Catalogs of Validated AntibodiesCell SIgnaling Technology provides the highest quality activation-state and total antibodies available for use in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). CST's antibodies have been extensively validated for IHC and IF by their in-house clinical applications group. As a guide for your research, CST have produced separate catalogs of their antibodies validated for immunochemistry and immunofluorescence.Email us for your specialised application catalog (please specify whether you want the IHC or IF catalog).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout GenesearchGenesearch is an Australian company founded in 1980.
