To change environment variables and the current directory for \nthe current shell, you have to use a script for that shell (e.g. a bash \nscript for a bash shell), and you have to invoke it a certain way.\n\nFor example, if your script is called myscript.sh, you'd do this:\n\n. myscript.sh\n\nNotice the period at the beginning of the line.\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
