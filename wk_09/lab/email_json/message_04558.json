Would you like to join us at\ndebian-desktop alioth group? I heard from Sledge that after Etch\nrelease (in place) he (or we) could work on add some established Live\nimages to cdimage.d.o and announce it through DWN, -news and\ntimes.debian.net (The idea was proposed in -publicity). Thoughts?\n\nBtw, what's the needed work to integrate d-i gtk and/or ubiquity in\nthe live desktop images for Lenny ? I prefer d-i gtk since it gives\nthe users full control on what they need to install. In other words\nthey can boot the live desktop image and install a dns server through\nits task.\n\nregards,\n-- stratus\nhttp://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-desktop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
