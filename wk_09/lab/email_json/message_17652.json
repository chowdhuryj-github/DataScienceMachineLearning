If you really need CCA, then\nperhaps try a standardisation of the raw data so that when you use rda()\nvia varpart(), what you get is close to something that cca() would\nreturn or is a good compromise for species data - see ?decostand with\nmethod == \"chi.square\" or \"method = \"hellinger\" in vegan and the cited\nreference to see what I'm talking about here.\n\nIf you want to do things by hand the old fashioned way, then look at\nusing Condition(var_x) in your formula:\n\nres <- cca(spp ~ var1 + var2 + Condition(spatial.vars), data = my.data)\n\nsee ?cca\n\nHTH\n\nG\n\n> \n> Cheers\n> Matt\n> \n> \t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n> \n> ______________________________________________\n> R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\n> https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\n> PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\n> and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n-- \n%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%~%\n Gavin Simpson                 [t] +44 (0)20 7679 0522\n ECRC, UCL Geography,          [f] +44 (0)20 7679 0565\n Pearson Building,             [e] gavin.simpsonATNOSPAMucl.ac.uk\n Gower Street, London          [w] http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfagls/\n UK.
