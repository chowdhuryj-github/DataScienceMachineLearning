For example, if I would like to\ngenerate a graph showing the population densities (in terms of the\nintensity of colors) for Illinois State by zip codes. I did some\nresearch; and it seems that package \"maptools\" is relevant. But I have\nthe following couple of questions regarding to the application. \n\n1.  A State is grouped by several counties, and sometimes we could\nfurther divide it into many areas by zip codes. Will there be any\ndifferences in the shapefiles (.shp)? Do I need to get a specific\nshapefile in order to graph on a zip code level? \n\n2. Where can I get this kind of shapefiles? \n\n3. There is another type of file (.dbf) which includes the attributes of\na geographic area. It seems I could put the population densities in it.\nBut then how could I relate it to the shapefile (.shp)? I mean how to\nlink a population density to its corresponding zip code area? \n\n4. Finally, how could I use intensity of colors to show the differences\nin the population densities? \n\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could provide me a simple\nexample. Thanks a lot! \n\n\nNingwei\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
