While I\nfind the information and ideas exchanged very helpful, I am fully disgusted\nby the amount of spam I receive. Over this last weekend, of 172 emails I\nreceived from this list, 52 were spam. That's nearly 1 in every 3. I am told\nthat I get this spam simply because I sent a couple emails to the list and\nthat exposed this exclusive address to these spammers. Well, say what you\nwill, but I feel it is the list manager's job to protect me from this crap.\nSince they either can't or won't, I'm signing off and deleting this mailbox.\n\n\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
