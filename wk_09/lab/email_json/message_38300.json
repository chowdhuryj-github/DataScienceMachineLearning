Not with  grml but with the modified knoppix CD on the speakup \nweb site. That was probably a year and a half ago. I can't tell you exactly \nwhat to do because I took so many false turns that I couldn't reproduce my \nown steps.  It took me probably 4 or 5 hours but I got it to work \neventually. If you know what you're doing you could probably do it in \nconsiderably less time.\n\nI don't think it matters which live CD you use. I found the instructions I \nused by googling for 'knoppix debootstrap'. I'm sure if you google for 'grml \ndebootstrap' you'll find lots of instructions.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Zachary Kline\" \nTo: \"Speakup is a screen review system for Linux.\" \nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 10:10 AM\nSubject: Re: Debian install with Software Speech?\n\n\n> Hiya,\n>    The reason I couldn't use a hardware synth is precisely because I don't\n> have a serial port on any of my machines.
