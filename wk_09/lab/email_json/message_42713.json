I know next to nothing about\nFreeBSD, but here's how libparrot.so.* is currently linked:\n\ncc -shared  -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-E -L/usr/local/lib -o blib/lib/libparrot.so.0.4.12 -Wl,-soname=libparrot.so.0.4.12 [list of objects] -lm -lcrypt -lutil -pthread -lreadline\n\n\nSoo... is that just something missing from the freebsd hints file,\nthen?\n\nMark\n\n"}
