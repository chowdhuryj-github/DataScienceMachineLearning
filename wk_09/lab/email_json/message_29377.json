Instinctive reactions can be\nboth universal and incorrect...and I think that's what this is.  At\nleast, among those who have even bothered to look into Perl instead of\njust repeating FUD.  As for the rest, nothing we do to P6 will\novercome the default \"Perl sucks\" reaction from such bigots.  Better\nto make it a powerful language with a compelling functional reason to\nuse it; if we succeed, we can maybe start to win back some mindshare\nand undo the rep damage caused by the cgi explosion.\n\nOn 5/14/07, Thomas Wittek  wrote:\n> herbert breunung schrieb:\n> > please make a decision for you to program in a language [..]\n>  > [..] try python.
