Editorial director \nBrian Livingston first reported the issue nearly a year ago, on \nJuly 27, 2006.\nContributing editor Susan Bradley \nhas documented Microsoft's attempts to solve it in the\n Jan. 18, \n Apr. 19, \n May 10, and \n May 24 issues this year.\nThe problem has risen to a such a degree that we feel all Windows users \nshould be aware of it.\n\nMicrosoft has long known of issues with svchost.exe \u2014 the process \nthat runs services of DLLs (dynamic link libraries). There are many symptoms associated with the problem. Among the most common is a drastic slowdown of computer performance as svchost.exe consumes memory and CPU \ncycles.\n\nThe cause of the issue turned out to be the service that provides \nAutomatic Updates. In response, many users began disabling \nMicrosoft Update, an enhanced version of the more-limited Windows \nUpdate.\n\nRecently, users who installed the beta 8.5 version of Microsoft's \nWindows Live Messenger found that Microsoft Update is automatically turned \non, with no choice for opting out. If you don't read the initial installer \ndialog carefully, you might not even notice what has happened. The practice \npotentially exposes an even wider number of users to the svchost.exe \nbug. (For more information, see a posting by a blogger named \n Pharod.)\n\nFigure 1. The Windows Live Beta installer turns on auto-updates \nand switches to Microsoft Update from Windows Update.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosing the problem on your own system\n\n\n\nHow do you know if you have this problem? If your system is experiencing a \ndramatic slowdown, try launching Windows Task Manager to see. To do this, \nright-click the Task Bar, the area to the right of the Start button, (or \npress Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and choose Task Manager. Make sure the Processes tab is \nactive, and click Image Name to sort the list. You'll see one or more instances \nof svchost.exe. If the CPU column shows 100%, or the memory\nusage seems extraordinarily high, you may be experiencing this bug.\n\nMicrosoft has detailed other symptoms in Knowledge Base article \n\n927891. These include an access violation\nerror in svchost.exe and unresponsive systems during update scans by \nWindows Update or Microsoft Update.\n\nSome users respond by selecting the memory-hogging svchost.exe in Task Manager's Processes tab and clicking End Process.\nUnfortunately, doing so can kill other services your system needs, such as audio. And, it won't prevent the problem from returning later.\n\nThe bug affects users of XP (all versions, including XP Media Center), \nWindows Server 2003, and Windows 2000.\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do if you're affected\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, Microsoft is offering a \ntwo-part fix. The first part has been offered to those who use Automatic \nUpdates since May 22, according to a source at Microsoft who asked not to \nbe named. Microsoft has been rolling out the second patch to users gradually, \nbeginning in early May, and expects to complete delivery by the end of June, \naccording to my source. Those who don't use Automatic Updates \u2014 or \nwho haven't received both fixes and want them sooner \u2014 can follow the \nsteps below:\nStep 1. Patch msi.dll. Users need to replace the msi.dll file \n(the Microsoft Installer DLL) that svchost.exe controls. To do this, \ndownload and install the patch from Knowledge Base article\n\n927891.\nStep 2. Update Windows Update. Users also need to get the latest Windows \nUpdate client, which is version 3.0. Links to the 32- and 64-bit versions can be \nfound at the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) Product Team\n blog.\n\nAlthough previous Microsoft fixes to svchost.exe \u2014 nearly a \nhalf-dozen in the last 10 months \u2014 addressed specific issues for \nsome users (such as patching memory leaks or eliminating svchost.exe \ncrashes, according to my source), none have solved all the problems once \nand for all. Even the patches \nMicrosoft currently offers will not stop svchost.exe from \nregistering 100% CPU usage in Task Manager's Processes tab at times. \nBut, the company claims, your system should still be responsive and \nsvchost.exe will share CPU cycles with other processes after \nboth patches have been installed.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft did not wait for these patches to be \ndelivered to everyone before issuing a Windows Live Messenger beta \nthat switches users from Windows Update to Microsoft Update. This introduced \nthe problem to some users who had not experienced it before.\n\nMicrosoft is confident that it has developed an effective solution to \nthis problem. Hopefully, this time the company's right.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReader, please rate the above article:\n1:\u00a0Poor\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t2:\u00a0Fair\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t3:\u00a0Good\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t4:\u00a0Great\u00a0\u00a05:\u00a0Superb\n\n\n\nScott Dunn is associate editor of the Windows Secrets Newsletter.

Soon thereafter, I received a phone call from Allison Wagda, \ndirector of public relations at Check Point, the maker of ZoneAlarm products. \nShe announced that Vista versions of the suite and its products would be \navailable immediately, and apologized to customers who were affected by the delay in getting the products out.\n\n\"We are offering anyone who purchased the suite a six-month extension \non their subscription to make up for the loss,\" \nWagda told me.  Check Point is also offering a refund to customers\nwho would rather return the product. To take advantage of these offers, \ncustomers in the U.S. should call 1-877-966-5221. Those outside the U.S. \nshould call +49 1805 104777 in Germany.\n\n\n\nMore on EULAs and transparency\n\n\n\nReferring to my conversation with Ed Foster on the subject of End User \nLicense Agreements (EULAs) in the \n\nJune 7 issue, reader Rich Painter has this comment:\n\n\n\n\"It was my understanding that the EULA was part of a contract between the buyer \nand the seller, and as such, if the buyer does not want to or cannot comply with \nthe EULA during the installation then the buyer has the right to a full refund. \nSeveral years ago, I disagreed with a EULA during the installation.  I packed it \nback up and took it back to the place I bought it from. I told them I did not \nagree to the EULA and demanded my refund.  They \ncomplied.\"\n\n\nI'm glad that worked for you, Rich. But think how annoying it is to have to \nbuy a product, open the package, and run\nthe installer before you know the terms of the contract.  Software developers \nneed to make this information simpler to understand, \nand make it available to customers before they make their purchase.\n\n\n\nRecalling EasyFlow's clear EULA language\n\n\n\nReader Walter Black enjoyed our mention of the 1980s product EasyFlow and \nits plainly worded license agreement in our \n\nJune 14 issue. He offers these words of praise for the product:\n\n\n\"I have been an enthusiastic EasyFlow user since the early 1980s, because the program does exactly what it claims to do, is unpretentious to a fault, and the entire user manual is written with the style and substance of the license agreement. The manual could (or maybe should) be used in the curriculum of any technical writing course.\"\n\nWalter also provides a quote from the manual:\n\n\n\"Fools Rush In: This section is for those of you who want to jump into the business of using EasyFlow to produce charts with a minimum of reading the manual. If you are in too big a hurry to read even these few pages, then we recommend our product 'HardFlow' (a charting template and a pencil); HardFlow has a lot of faults, but having to spend time reading the manual isn't one of them.\"\n\n\nWalter adds:\n\n\n\"The section continues with a two-page whirlwind overview and then over 100 pages of concise and detailed description of program features.\n\n\"Many thanks for the article, and for the fond memories that it recalled of my participation in software development of that time.\"\n\n\nThank you, Walter, for the chance to discuss a piece of software \nhistory.\n\nReaders Painter and Black will receive gift certificates for \na book, CD, or DVD of their choice for sending us comments that we \nprinted.\n\n\nContents\n\u00a0Index\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nGet your product seen by 270,000 readers\nDoes your company offer a product or service?
