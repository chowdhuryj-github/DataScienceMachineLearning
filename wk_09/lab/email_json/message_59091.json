So the eigenvalues are the complex numbers (generally) that are located at equal angles on the circle of radius 5^(1/6), at angles 2*pi*k/6, where k runs from 0 to 5.  Thus, the roots are:\n\nz_k = 5^(1/6) * exp(i * 2*pi*k/6), k= 0, 1, ..., 5.\n\nwhere i = sqrt(-1).\n\nRavi.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Spencer Graves \nDate: Friday, June 29, 2007 6:51 pm\nSubject: Re: [R] Dominant eigenvector displayed as third (Marco Visser)\nTo: Marco Visser \nCc: r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch\n\n\n>       There is no dominant eigenvalue:  The eigenvalues of that matrix \n> \n>  are the 6 different roots of 5.
