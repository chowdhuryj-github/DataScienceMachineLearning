I\u2019ll take a\n  closer look at this story for you.\n\u00a0\nBefore that, the news of the day. To start out our\n  broadcast, David Martin will have an exclusive report on Pentagon planning\n  and the war in Iraq.\n  Meanwhile, are Democrats blinking first on the prospect of a withdrawal\n  deadline? Sharyl Attkisson will fill you in.\n\u00a0\nA different kind of debate is heating up on the\n  streets \u2013 and on the Web. An anti-informant \u201cstop\n  snitching\u201d campaign now has a high-tech edge. And this is infuriating\n  federal prosecutors, Bob Orr will explain.\n\u00a0\nAs Hurricane season approaches, National Weather\n  Service forecasters warn that they expect between 13 and 17 tropical storms\n  this year, with at least seven of them becoming hurricanes. Is the Gulf Coast\n  ready? Hari Sreenivasan will examine New\n    Orleans\u2019 levee system and whether it is\n  equipped to survive a major storm.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve been following the story of the two whales\n  stranded 60 miles up the Sacramento River in California. Sandra Hughes will tell you\n  about the obstacles still in their way en route to their ocean home \u2013\n  and the hope spectators have for their safe return.\n\u00a0\nFinally, we\u2019ll come back to Philadelphia, where we will settle down\n  with a cheesesteak and channel some memories from decades past in The City of\n  Brotherly Love.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKatie Couric\nCouricandCo@cbs.com \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here.\nContact: Email Administrator,\nCBSNews.com, 524 W. 57th St.,\nRoom 514/1, New York, NY, 10019\nHelp | Advertise\n| Terms of Service | Privacy Statement\n\u00a9MMVI, CBS Worldwide Inc, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
