There seems to be a difference\nfrom previous versions if I use a ~/.Rprofile file to load the\ngraphics package, since the grDevices does NOT automatically load\nwhereas it did in R-2.4.x versions.  That might be a bug, but since\nothers don't seem to have the problem, I'd hesitate to say.  \n\nIn any case, if grDevices isn't in the search list, I'd be fairly\ncertain you can get round the problem you describe by specifically\nloading it, or adding it to the startup list of packages.  (I'm\nassuming you installed R from the tgz file and not an rpm).  I, too,\nuse Redhat/Fedora but other users don't seem to have the same problem,\nso it's likely something more specific to our setups.\n\nAs ever, the more knowledgeable could have a better idea.\n\nHTH\n\n-- \n~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.   \n   ___    Patrick Connolly   \n {~._.~}          \t\t Great minds discuss ideas    \n _( Y )_  \t  \t        Middle minds discuss events \n(:_~*~_:) \t       \t\t Small minds discuss people  \n (_)-(_)  \t                           .....
