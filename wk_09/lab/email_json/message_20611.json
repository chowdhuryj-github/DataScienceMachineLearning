I don't know how this would affect phonographic performance royalties (royalties on the sound recording, rather than the composition), or even whether such royalties are collected in the US at all (in the UK this is administered by PPL, who currently will not collect on CC-licenced music).\nHowever, I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.Good luck!TimOn 5/1/07, adisa mckenzie <\nadisa@crescentclub.com> wrote:i am thinking about hiring a\u00a0 music broker to put a few songs on the radio.\u00a0 what licenses will allow me to still collect ascap royalties.\u00a0 and how would that work\n_______________________________________________cc-community mailing listcc-community@lists.ibiblio.org\nhttp://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community\n\n"}
