I will try to add the\nremaining \"50 pages\" sometime in late June and early July, but\nI tried to make the existing 50 pages stand on its own. \nThe document is now linked from the etoys page in the wiki (Thanks to\nWalter for doing this):\nSee\n\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/Etoys\nand\n\nhttp://www.laptop.org/OLPCEtoys.pdf\nP.S. I still think that what I've been advocating since early last\nyear -- an OLPC version of something like Etoys/Scratch/Logo that is\ndeeply integrated with OLPC media -- is a really good idea. There is\nnothing sacred about Etoys. It only has two main things going for it (a)\nit has been tested with many thousands of children around the world over\nthe last 10 years, and (b) its range of applications for children's\nauthoring using \"math and media\".\nThe weakness of Etoys is that it is primarily aimed at 4-5-6 graders (and\ndoes well with this age group). It has been used successfully in Japan\nwith 6 and 7 year olds despite the UI not being the best fit for them.\nAnd it has been used with older children as well (they need a few more\nfeatures from the underlying Squeak and a somewhat different UI -- some\nof which we are doing this summer).\nOTOH, the presentation facilities are pretty useful -- especially for\ndynamic presentations of actual work. I've been using them exclusively\nfor all my talks since about 1998.\nBut quite a bit could be done better on all fronts. For the OLPC XO,\nespecially wrt to integration both across and down (so that there is a\n\"Model T\" version of all the media in children's script, and\nall media objects can be mixed).\nSince Python was chosen as the underlying programmatic representation for\nthe XO, I tried to convince the Python community last year to take a shot\nat making an Etoys-like environment, but as far as I can tell there have\nbeen no takers. I think Ivan has some interest in this as well. So I\nagree with the nature of Eben's desires. \nThe key word is integration, and, as you well know, this is a lot harder\n- both in design and integration - to pull off gracefully than it it\nseems at first glance. I would be very happy to see an environment that\nis as comprehensive as (or more ideally, much better than) Etoys --\nespecially if it can be placed at a more fundamental level than as a\nseparate Activity. (That was actually my original hope for\nSugar.)\nCheers,\nAlan\n\nAt 12:24 PM 6/2/2007, Samuel Klein wrote:\nEben, this might be a great\nopportunity to spend some time with the\netoys team working out how you could realize what you have in mind\nwith existing tools.\u00a0 As Alan notes, it is designed to do very\nmuch\nwhat you are writing about -- as well as\u00a0 doing some excellent sugar\n&\n1200x900 emulation ;-)\nI'd like to spend a day this coming week working through Alan's\n50-of-100 notes, and the use cases you have in mind.\u00a0 (Alan, can\nwe\nmake the document public?)\nAs for presentations and slides, Etoys remains for the time being\nour\nsupported method for importing .ppt -- Rebecca, have you tried this?\nWere you asking for something more specific?\nSJ\nps - That might also be a good opportunity to think about what a\ngeneric bundle looks like.\nOn 6/2/07, Alan Kay <alan.kay@squeakland.org> wrote:\nYou might want to check out what\nEtoys actually does and is.
