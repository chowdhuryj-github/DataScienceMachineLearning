When you print it, it is\ndisplayed as a table. When you plot it (e.g. plot(quadratcount(X))), \nit is displayed using the method 'plot.quadratcount'. \n\nIf 'X' is your point pattern, then\n       plot(X)\nwill plot the point pattern X, then\n       qX <- quadratcount(X, 4, 4)\nwill calculate the quadrat counts in a 4 x 4 grid of quadrats, \nand \n       plot(qX, add=TRUE)\nwill overplot the quadrat boundary lines and overprint the quadrat counts\nas text numerals. Notice the argument `add=TRUE' which superimposes\nthe quadrat counts on the previous plot. \n\nIf you only want to display the quadrat boundaries and not the counts,\nthen the last line should be replaced by\n       plot(qX, add=TRUE, entries=NULL)\n\nThe code in example(quadratcount) shows how to get thicker lines\nand change colours, etc.\n\nAdrian Baddeley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
