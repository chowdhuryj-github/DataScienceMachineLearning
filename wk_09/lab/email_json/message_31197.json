I would like to\nutilize the graphical capabilities of R to generate\nplots that I would then display in my software\nprogram.  What is the best way to go about this?  I\nhave looked at Rserve and also looked at re-compiling\nR as a shared library.  \n\nI am looking for something that can be distributed\ninternally with my program (so that the user does not\nneed to install R separately) if possible, and also\nsomething relatively small.\n\nAny suggestions on how to proceed?  Good tutorials on\nthis subject?  Thanks for any advice\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Take the Internet to Go: Yahoo!Go puts the Internet in your pocket: mail, news, photos & more.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
