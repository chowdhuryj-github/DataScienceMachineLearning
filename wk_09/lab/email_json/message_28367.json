Red Hat recently has released a\nset of fonts under the GPL with an exception about it's trademarks. This\nfonts can cover the lack of Arial, Times and Courier fonts.\n\nWe started our work to package them for Debian but noticed that's better\nto ask debian-legal about the license before uploading the package.\n\nYou can find the exact license here:\nhttp://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-fonts/packages/ttf-liberation/trunk/debian/copyright?op=file&rev=0&sc=0\n\nPlease advise if it's needed to add something in the copyright file or so.\n\nThanks,\nAlan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
