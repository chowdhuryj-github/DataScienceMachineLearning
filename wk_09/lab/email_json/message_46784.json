The error message itself states \"this application has failed to start because libifcoremdd.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.\" I have reinstalled the program (with full installation) but still get the same error. I received the dll from a colleague who never had this issue on his computer, so I don't think it is problem with a compiler or the source code. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers,\n\nIan McCarthy\nDepartment of Economics\nIndiana University\n100 S.
