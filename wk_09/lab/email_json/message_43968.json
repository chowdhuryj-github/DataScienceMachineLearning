Launch on a space station assembly mission is scheduled for 7:38 p.m. Friday.\n\nTorrential rain fell on Merritt Island late today and forecasters predicted possible wind gusts higher than 50 knots and a chance for half-inch hail. A freak hail storm Feb. 26 damaged Atlantis' external fuel tank and repairs delayed the flight three months.\n\nAs it turned out, the worst of today's weather appeared to miss the space center and no major problems were reported. A NASA spokesman said work to load the ship's fuel cell system with hydrogen and oxygen was delayed about two hours by the weather, but by 8:30 p.m. engineers were ready to press ahead with the five-hour procedure.\n\nThey will make up the lost time as required during a four-hour built-in hold scheduled to begin at 1 a.m. Thursday.\n\n=================================\n\nQuick-Launch Web Links:\n\nCBS News STS-117 Status Reports:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html\n\nCBS News STS-117 Quick-Look Page:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html\n\nNASA Shuttle Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/index.html\nNASA Station Web: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/index.html\nSpaceflight Now: http://spaceflightnow.com/index.html\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently subscribed to the CBS Space  News mailing list. \r\nTo unsubscribe, go to\r\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/registration/unsubscribe.php\r\n"}
