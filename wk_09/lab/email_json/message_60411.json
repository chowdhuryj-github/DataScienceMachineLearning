First, labeling the y-axis\nseems to be a problem - I cannot get it to change.\n\nSecond, I would like to overlay ccdf's on the same plot. I can get them on\nthe same plot with new=TRUE.  However, when I try to scale the quartz window\n(I'm on a Mac), the two ccdf's do not scale the same and they no longer line\nup.  \n\nI've wandered through the archives, but have not hit on solutions to the\nabove nor alternatives to heR.Misc for plotting the ccdf. Any insight would\nbe appreciated.\n\n\nMany thanks, \nDave\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
