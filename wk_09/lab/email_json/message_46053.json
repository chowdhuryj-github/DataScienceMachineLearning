I suggest you take a\nlook at the references bellow. There is also some online material by the same\nauthors. Additionally, I remember that there were lively discussions about ICC\non \"multilevel\" list at\n\nhttp://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/multilevel.html\n\nBest wishes, Gregor\n\n@Article{Goldstein:2002,\n  author =       {Goldstein, H. and Browne, W. and Rabash, J.},\n  title =        {Partitioning variation in multilevel models},\n  journal =      {Understanding Statistics},\n  year =         {2002},\n  volume =       {1},\n  number =       {4},\n  pages =        {223--231},\n  keywords =     {variance ratio, variance partition coefficient,\n                  intra-unit correlation, intra-class correlation, normal\n                  models, discrete models, random coefficient models}\n}\n\n@Article{Browne:2005,\n  author =       {Browne, W.
