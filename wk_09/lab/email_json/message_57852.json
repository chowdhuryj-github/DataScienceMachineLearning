I used  \nmodel.matrix to create dummy variables but it always picked the  \nsmallest one as the reference. For example,\n\nmodel.matrix(~.,data=as.data.frame(letters[1:5]))\n\nwill code 'a' as '0 0 0 0'. But I want to code another category as  \nreference, say 'b'. How to do it in R using model.matrix? Is there  \nother way to do it if model.matrix  has no such functionality?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\t[[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
