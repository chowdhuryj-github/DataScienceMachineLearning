I suggest you try creating a series of 2d bar\ncharts instead - you are far more likely to be able to interpret them\neasily.\n\nFor this data, you might also want to look into fluctuation diagrams.\n\nHadley\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
