One is the tiny patch to\nenable disabling of ADS. The other is a patch to re-enable ldb for\ngroup mapping. The ldb patch should also be quite small, as it doesn't\nneed any updates to the ldb code in the samba3 tree, as Samba3 doesn't\nneed any of the newer features.\n\nI should get these in by the 4th, but it will be close, as I want to\nspend at least a day re-testing the ldb change.\n\nI also plan on making the ldb change configurable. I know we discussed\nthis previously and thought it wasn't necessary, but I think that\nthere should be some way of disabling major code path changes like\nthis. I'd propose that we document the option as one that is expected\nto go away in future releases. I hope that's OK.\n\nI also wonder if we should consider using a 'precious' minor release\nnumber at some point? For example, once we consider the clustering\ncode in Samba3 to be production ready, perhaps it should be called\n3.1.0 not 3.0.XX ? :-)\n\nCheers, Tridge\n\n"}
