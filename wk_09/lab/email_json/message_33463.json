I thought I could construct a five dimensional array to have the three dimensional array of matrices.  However, not all of the matrices in the array have the same dimensions, which seems to mean I can't use a five dimensional array.\n\nWhat I'd like is this:\n\nA = matrix(1:4,2,2)\nB = matrix(1:25,5,5)\nC = matrix(1,3,3)\nD = matrix(1,4,4)\n\nI'd like to construct an array for which, if I type F[1,1], it returns matrix A, type F[1,2] and it returns B, type F[2,1] and it returns C, or type F[2,2] and it returns D.\n\nEssentially, I'd like to be able to access them like they were elements of a matrix.  Although this example is only a two dimensional array of matrices, I'd like it to also work with three dimensions also.\n\nThe only thing I thought of to try was to make an array of lists and store the matrices inside of an array of lists (where each matrix is stored as a list with one item).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n-Scott\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
