There is one (algorithm 280) for 2x2  \nFisher exact test but I couldn't find one for 2x3 table. If we are  \nnot lucky enough to have one, is there any other way to calculate  \nexact power of 2x3 table? The reason why I want exact power is  \nbecause some cells are assumed to be very small and chi square  \napproximation is not valid.\n\nThanks!\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
