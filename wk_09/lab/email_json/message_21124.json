The current free version is\n2.8.3.  Obviously, if we need to keep this file, we should get up to the \nmost recent version.  I wouldn't however, mess with it much to make it \npass coding standards, since that would make it much more difficult to \npatch to keep up to date with the original.\n\nSteve Peters\nsteve@fisharerojo.org\n\n"}
