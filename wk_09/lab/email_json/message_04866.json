Where do you get the \"sorted iptables\narray\" from?\n\nPerhaps something like this (UNTESTED):\n\nwhile (  ) {\n    if ( ?^-A OUTPUT? ) {\n        print @sorted_iptables;\n        }\n    print;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n-- \nPerl isn't a toolbox, but a small machine shop where you can special-order\ncertain sorts of tools at low cost and in short order.       -- Larry Wall\n\n-- \nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org\nhttp://learn.perl.org/\n\n\n"}
