Finally talked to family Doc -checked out OK for blood pressure etc-we decided to give Cialis a go. Stunned by the first time and subsequent results. A hard and lasting erection -plenty of orgasms for my lady-and surprisingly similar results next few days WITHOUT another tablet. 'Topping up' about once a week. Some nausea after, but a small inconvenience for the wonderful benefits.\nDavid Cook.\nYou can find it here \n\n\n"}
