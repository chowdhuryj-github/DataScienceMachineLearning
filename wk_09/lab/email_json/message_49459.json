I don't get speakup at start-up, \nand when X starts I get an error message that I can't read.  How can I fix \nthis?  I'm using Yasr for the moment, but really prefer speakup.\n\nThanks,\nTerrence\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpeakup mailing list\nSpeakup@braille.uwo.ca\nhttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup\n\n"}
