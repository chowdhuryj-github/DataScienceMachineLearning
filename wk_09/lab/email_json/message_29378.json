But I am currently testing it\nand so far it seems to work fine.\n\nThe next step in my plan is to generalize the validation\nmechanism to a tdb_open_log_validate function in lib/util_tdb.c.\nThere ist nothing very special about the cache tdb here,\nand this might be useful elsewhere...\n\nMichael\n\n\nModified:\n   branches/SAMBA_3_0/source/nsswitch/winbindd_cache.c\n\n\nChangeset:\nSorry, the patch is too large (751 lines) to include; please use WebSVN to see it!\nWebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22845\n\n"}
