I would like to compute monthly averages.\n   I would like to have the average measure for month #5 for the first\nthree rows (the same number in the first three lines) and the average\nmeasure for month #6 for the last four rows ((the same number in the first\nthree lines) in a separate vesctor (let's call it 'result')\n   I tried to use a \"while\" statement inside a \"for\" loop but it doesn't\nseem to work.\n   Can someone please help me with this ?\n\n   Measure Month\n   2.28 5\n   14.04 5\n   0.60 5\n   0.21 6\n   0.96 6\n   0.75 6\n   1.28 6\n\n   Thank you !\n\n             [[alternative HTML version deleted]]\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide\nhttp://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n______________________________________________\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n\n"}
