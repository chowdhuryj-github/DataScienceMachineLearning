(Join me today and you can see what I mean.)\u00a0  That is, fewer and fewer stocks are participating in these oft-celebrated new highs.\nSo let me ask you, if the stocks you own aren\u2019t making new highs\u2026what does it matter that the market IS making new highs?\n\nTrick question. It doesn\u2019t.\nRule #4: Pay attention to the charts.\u00a0  They\u2019ll tell you what IS going on in the market (rather then you speculating about what could happen).\nFor instance, some of you may think that you could buck the current trend (from Rule #3) and make money from your portfolio stocks even if they aren\u2019t following the market.\nWell, if you look at the charts and you see the market highs and your stocks are the ones not following that upward pattern \u2014 then CONGRATULATIONS \u2014 you have succeeded in finding the stocks that are going to do well!\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Get Carry-Traded Away\nThe carry trade is a trading method that attempts to exploit the difference (or \u201ccarry\u201d) in interest rates paid for one currency versus another.\u00a0  The idea is to borrow money in the low interest rate currency, and lend it in the high interest rate currency, in order to profit from the spread between the two.\nFor example, the Bank of Japan set short-term interest rates at 0.5% in early 2007, while the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates at 5.25%.\u00a0  You can borrow the equivalent of $100,000 in yen\u2014i.e., 11,900,000 yen at an exchange rate of 119 yen per dollar\u2014at an interest rate of 0.5%.\u00a0  You can then exchange the yen for $100,000 and lend the $100,000 at the U.S. interest rate of 5.25% (e.g., by buying U.S. bonds).\u00a0  Excluding other costs, your profit would be the difference between the two interest rates, or 4.75% (5.25% \u2013 0.5%).\nThe problem is that currency exchange rates and interest rates can change and lead your borrowing costs to exceed your lending income.\u00a0  Also, the price of a bond or other security you invest in could decline.\nWhat does that mean for you right now?\u00a0  With the massive carry trade speculation going on, there could be a huge unwinding of carry trades.\u00a0  (Remember, the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank are all due to meet soon.)\u00a0  And that could have an enormous impact on your portfolio.\u00a0   It\u2019s one of the many factors I\u2019m keeping an eye on for my Trending123 subscribers.\u00a0  Don\u2019t get \u201ccarry-traded away.\u201d  Join me at Trending123 now.\n\n\n\n\nSo how do you win the game?\nBy succeeding at the objective \u2014 making and keeping the money you\u2019ve made!\nMy best suggestion for making the best profits you\u2019ve ever made?\u00a0  Joining me at Trending123 of course!\nLast week I dared you to give Trending123 a try.\u00a0  A lot of you did.\u00a0  Some of you may have remained skeptical.\u00a0  After all, the market has been sitting pretty \u2014 thinking highly of itself even since I threw out my dare last Tuesday.\nBut I\u2019m sticking to my guns here.\u00a0  I\u2019m even more convinced of a coming correction.\u00a0  That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to take the tried and true tactic of children everywhere \u2014 I\u2019m gonna throw out a DOUBLE DARE!\nAnd even though the stakes have changed (you can\u2019t ignore a double dare you know!), the Trending123 guarantee has not.\u00a0  You still have 90 days where you will be fully protected by our money-back guarantee.\nSo take my double dare to be sure you\u2019re with me when the correction hits and my buy alerts go out!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn LansingTrending123\n\nP.S.
