Being loved by someone deeply gives you courage.\nMen show their character in nothing more clearly than what they think laughable.\nIf one age believes too much it is natural that another believes too little.\nAll work and no play makes one the wealthiest man in the cemetery.\nA stumble may prevent a fall.\nAny fact is better established by two or three good testimonies than by a thousand arguments.\nYou can preach a better sermon with your life than with your lips.\nThere is always a chance that he who sets himself up as his brother's keeper will end up by being his jail-keeper.\nI sometimes give myself admirable advice, but I am incapable of taking it.\nActing doesn't bring anything to a text. On the contrary, it detracts from it.\nIf a little knowledge is dangerous, where is the man who has so much as to be out of danger?\nI knew my trainer believed in me and I couldn't let Him down.\nParting is such sweet sorrow.\n\u00a0"}
